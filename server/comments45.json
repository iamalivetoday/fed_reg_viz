I work in a hospital where my being inattentive puts people&rsquo;s lives at risk. The stress of this weighs heavily on me, so to not have treatment for this part of my disability is exhausting. On top of that, since the shortages began, adderall no longer works the way it used to. The formula was clearly changed but there is no evidence of this that I can find online besides other patients like me who have all experienced this same thing. My doctor and I are in the process of switching medications and the one she thinks I&rsquo;ll do best with can&rsquo;t be prescribed right now, because there&rsquo;s a shortage&hellip; Life is already hard enough just having the illnesses that I do. Having to worry about my treatment being unavailable hurts not just me and others with the same diagnosis, but also those that are impacted by our work (like critically ill patients in hospitals). Please find a way to fix this and please look into how adderall has been changed. Thank you. ",

Last year, I found myself in a situation where I had to pay $220 for my medication, a stark increase from the usual $20 co-pay my insurance provides. This price surge was due to the only pharmacy that had stock charging much more after insurance coverage. Such an experience was not only financially straining but also deeply upsetting, as I was charged ten times more than what I typically pay.<br/><br/>Additionally, the struggle to locate my medication (generic Vyvanse) has been ongoing. I&#39;ve had to call multiple pharmacies to find one that carries my prescription. During this process, I discovered that CVS and Walgreens do not share inventory status across their stores. This lack of information forced me to individually contact each CVS or Walgreens in my area, a task both time-consuming and frustrating. It&#39;s disappointing that these nationwide pharmacies lack a centralized system to streamline the search for medications that are out of stock in one location but available in another.<br/><br/>Moreover, my reliance on these medications for daily functioning adds another layer of stress. The constant threat of not being able to access them only exacerbates the anxiety I already experience as a comorbidity of ADHD.<br/><br/>I am, however, encouraged to learn that the government is investigating this issue. My hope is for a swift resolution that leads to a positive outcome, alleviating the challenges faced by many like myself. Thank you.",

Actually, maybe you&rsquo;re just really trying to kill all of us because why would you want somebody with the mental illness to live here in America this needs to be fixed immediately. I know countless people that are suffering myself included. You know how long it took the pre-authorization of my insurance to even approve Vyvanse the only drug that maybe a pharmacy within the tri-state might have. You are hurting and killing people. Without proper medication. Unfortunately, the suicide epidemic comes into play. You need to fix this. Isnt this supposed to be the best country in the world? There&rsquo;s absolutely no reason these drugs can&rsquo;t be manufactured. You are doing this on purpose, and it will be proven, and you will pay, but as long as you could sleep at night, knowing it, a large percentage of America is suffering because of your errors. This is sickening and makes our country look like a joke. Is that what you want you want our country to look like a joke to all the other countries? Again, this needs to be fixed.

In a first world country people are being institutionalized because they can&rsquo;t handle the withdrawal from the medication that you all prescribed to us prescribe to us so you can make your money and then take it away because the sales done the only ones making money now are the insurance companies. Pretty sure they pay you. Who is gonna pay you when you&rsquo;ve killed off all the people with mental illnesses? what&rsquo;s next? Are you gonna start saying that diabetes medication is on backorder cancer medication is on back order? MS medication is on back order? When will you realize that mental illness is just as important as cancer as AIDS&hellip; right right you didn&rsquo;t care about people who had aids until you were forced to. so this is us the majority telling you we are done. We are a generation of people that will get together rally together, protest together and we&rsquo;ll do it right in front of the White House peacefully.

You couldn&rsquo;t possibly convince me that you actually care about Americans.. it&rsquo;s really strange that the FDA also handles the overseeing of our food. Ever hear of red Dye 40? Yeah, my generation knows all about it you could keep trying to kill us, but you&rsquo;re only gonna piss us off more.. I am ashamed to be an American. I hope you&rsquo;re happy.

I know that given ADHD medications like Vyvanse are stimulants and therefore can be abused if not taken as directed by doctor for a condition where they actually provide benefit so I understand the need to regulate access for public health and safety, but let&rsquo;s also be honest that in a first world country like the US, no patient should ever be unable to get their necessary medications because of a failure of government regulations leading to ongoing shortages lasting well over a year! That&rsquo;s cruel and heartless to keep those same problematic regulations in place while people like me struggle to get our medications and have to worry if this time I won&rsquo;t be able to get the medication I need to both do my job and stay on top of the ongoing demands life sends my way. Too many treat ADHD like it&rsquo;s some kind of joke disorder without real consequences or side effects and frankly if anyone in charge of these regulations thinks that way they should be immediately fired and barred from public service for their total ignorance and casual cruelty. At the end of the day, the government regulates the supply so for the last year people have been showing up to work totally fine with the idea that their efforts make the world a worse place for people like myself all the while fighting a nonsensical war on drugs that anyone with any sense between their ears knows the government lost long ago. Bad actors will continue to circumvent these restrictions while patients like myself with no other treatments available for our disability will continue to suffer unless the government steps back and relaxes quotas and other supply constraints to allow the shortage to end naturally as the free market moves to actually satisfy the demand needed to treat conditions like ADHD in the US. The real problem is this was obvious months ago and was not done immediately so the people responsible for the continued suffering need to be held responsible for their failure and made aware of the ongoing suffering that&rsquo;s occurring. Maybe that will finally inspire them to stop being so heartless and cruel to those with ongoing disabilities. After all it makes no sense to put a group of people with known executive functioning issues through the ringer of calling every pharmacy in a 50 mile radius at the end of every month just to get the medication that medical professionals have already agreed that you need. It&rsquo;s doubly painful that due to restrictions on refills you can&rsquo;t refill a prescription until the day it runs out so any shortage means days without medication and thus significantly reduced function. If this was a cancer medication people would rightly call you monsters for the completely artificial shortages but it&rsquo;s like ADHD is a second class medical condition so people get away with monstrous acts for months on end and currently there is still no end in sight to these government caused shortages.

In the past year I have faced multiple shortages of my medication at different New York pharmacies, spending hours on the phone trying to locate where I could have my prescription filled (while making sure the pharmacy remained in-network). At the beginning of December 2023 my pharmacy stated they were out of Vyvanse and Adderall and didn&#39;t know when they&#39;d have it in stock again. This lasted throughout the month, onwards. During that time I needed to travel across the country to help my father who suffers from Parkinsons. My insurance does not cover out-of-state doctors or prescriptions, so I knew I&#39;d go without medication. My father has been prescribed Vyvanse to help with his own cognitive function, but the pharmacies in California were also out of stock and he too went without his medication. No other medication has helped as significantly with his cognition as Vyvanse has. I have rationed what Vyvanse I have left for almost 3 months, taking one pill every other week when needed. Ultimately I&#39;ve just stopped taking it altogether. It is difficult to gauge how impactful living without my medication has been. My mood, anxiety, capacity to focus, and day-to-day management of my life and career has all become more challenging as a result its absence. Receiving a late diagnosis of ADHD changed my life and illuminated how difficult decades prior had been unmedicated. With that awareness, it is incredibly disheartening to keep facing pharmacists, hours spent on phones, prior authorizations, and ultimately rejections due to shortages. There also feels to be a kind of stigma associated with getting these medications, which in turn creates even more pressure and emotional duress when it simply allows me to move through my day more consciously and effectively.

    "text": "I have been taking Vyvanse for binge eating disorder for a year and a half now. It is the only FDA approved medication for it, there are no other alternatives. I had no issue filing Vyvanse or the generic until January 2024. Right when coverage by my insurance dropped for the brand. My insurance, who uses Optum Rx, has at minimum due to the shortage allowed some coverage of the brand as a tier 3 medication. That means a 30 day supply is $90 compared to the generic&rsquo;s tier 1 30 day supply cost of $10. I don&rsquo;t know how long this shortage is going to last but it&rsquo;s already been going on with other ADHD medications for over a year so I don&rsquo;t see it going away anytime soon. $90 a month for a year is $1080 vs $120 for a year of generic. That&rsquo;s not affordable in the long run especially when I&rsquo;m already paying for other medications as well. <br/><br/>I have also learned from my pharmacist at a major brand (Walmart, Kroger, Meijer level pharmacy) that CVS and Walgreens have made a deal with the generic manufacturer to receive priority of their supply. They are making something already in short supply even harder to find for those not using those pharmacies. Walgreens and CVS also are comparatively much more expensive than every other pharmacy for nearly every medication when prices are compared on GoodRx. This screams greed and hoarding. ",

It has helped me tremendously; I went from effectively failing out of school to being able to graduate from a top university with a degree in computer science. I need this medication to function. However, the very real shortage has made it a multi-day adventure that I need to undergo every month in order to get this medication. I have to call multiple pharmacies to figure out which, if any, have it in stock, and I then have to  have my doctor send it there and travel way out of my way to get there. Sometimes, no pharmacies have the medication I need, so I have to ask my doctor to prescribe a different medication that&#39;s less effective. This is made especially difficult by the nature of ADHD as a condition, which makes it difficult to manage unstructured tasks like this. I believe that the shortage has caused a huge obstacle in my and others lives, and I think that regulation changes to make it less pertinent would be well placed. I understand the fear that some of the supply will be diverted towards illicit pathways, but this happens now too, and I know that some have considered turning to the black market to acquire the medications that they need.

    "text": "Hello,<br/>Thank you for taking the time to look into this. As an individual, I cannot speak to the specific underlying issues here, but I can share my experiences over the last two years regarding trying to get my ADHD medication. <br/>A little backstory: I was diagnosed as an adult, in my early 20s, and that was a game changer. I always did well in school, so I believe that prevented me from being diagnosed as a child. My understanding, and from what I remember in middle school and high school, it really took severe behavioral issues or poor grades to really have someone say &ldquo;hey! they might have ADHD&rdquo;<br/>My behavior issues were relatively mild and could be chalked up to just standard young people stuff, and my grades were still very good. This was because I was smart and didn&rsquo;t really need to study. <br/>That is what somewhat led me to my &ldquo;downfall&rdquo; in my late teens/early 20s, while trying to get through college.<br/>Ultimately, I had a sort of breakdown, and after a year or two of meeting with both psychologists and psychiatrists, I was diagnosed with ADHD and Major Depressive Disorder. After spending months and months finding the right medications to help, I really started moving forward and put my life back together.<br/>I have been on this journey for about 13 years now, and the shortages these last 2 or so years has really threatened to derail my life.<br/><br/>Here is what I have had to endure:<br/>Spending anywhere from 15 min to 5 hours a month calling different pharmacies around my area to see if they have my medication in stock.<br/>Spending 45 min to 2 hours going back and forth with my doctor trying to get my prescription sent to a different pharmacy than I normally use.<br/>&ldquo;Rationing&rdquo; my medication so that I at least have SOMETHING in case I can&rsquo;t get my medication on time and something at work requires my best effort.<br/>Going 2 weeks without my medication, and almost losing my job, because every other coping mechanism outside of medication does not have the same impact as medication.<br/><br/>I have tried everything I can glean from friends, online, my doctors, and whatever else I can think of to live without medication. I dislike that I am dependent on something. <br/>I am trying, believe me!<br/><br/>In my area, from what I have experienced, is that the generic for Adderall is produced by one pharmaceutical company. There aren&rsquo;t other options. So when that company is unable to meet demand, there is no one else to fill the gap. <br/><br/>Please don&rsquo;t punish us ADHD people. <br/>I understand that these drugs can be abused, and probably are. But they will probably always find a way to get those meds. Limiting the access just hurts us, people who actually have ADHD, and need it to live a semi-normal, functioning life.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.",

A pharmacist told me this was happening because Vyvanse went &quot;generic&quot; and now there&#39;s less profit in it for the drug company that had a monopoly on the formula, so they scaled back production. I have been on Vyvanse for 12 years. I have never had issues like this receiving my medication. My local pharmacist personally called 15 other pharmacies in my area and up to an HOUR away from Chicago to try to find my medication. No luck at all. Even if he had found it, the script could not be transfered even within Walgreens, so I would have had to get a hold of my PCP (which is hard to do) and get her to cancel the OG script and then send it to the new location. Also, I qualified for a Takeda Cares Rx charity care program that I was approved through May for. Takeda discontinued this program in December with no recourse. I can no longer afford my RX, nor can I afford the generic out of pocket. ",

The shortage led to me having to call 9+ pharmacies every month trying to find one with my ADHD meds in stock. Due to long hold times  this would add up to an extra 2 hours to my day. Once I&rsquo;d find a pharmacy with my meds, I would have to contact my psychiatrist to call in a totally new script to that new pharmacy, as it isn&rsquo;t legal in my state to transfer stimulant prescriptions between pharmacies (even if it&rsquo;s the same company, like all CVS&rsquo;s). Often times it would take 24 hours for my doctor to do so, and then that pharmacy would be out of pills again and I&rsquo;d have to call many more pharmacies the next day. Once I finally found a pharmacy that had it in stock and my doctor called it in, I would have to drive far away from my county (45 minutes +) to pick up the medication. Doing all this was demoralizing to be treated like some kind of pill addict, especially because with adhd I have a neurological condition that makes planning and executing something of this scale each month very very difficult! It was so difficult that some months I had to give up and go without my legally prescribed medication. My work suffered, but more importantly I worried that the safety of me driving on the road without distraction suffered. Why am I being penalized for being legally prescribed a medication for a disorder I&rsquo;ve had for decades, with no history of addiction? ",

When a psychiatrist finally did agree to see me to look at treatment options for my depression, she refused to consider adhd as an underlying cause, because she was unable to offer a trial medication course, which is the standard of care. <br/><br/>My access to all mental health services as an adult with adhd has been impacted by the shortage of stimulants, and I&#39;ve never even been prescribed them before. It was simply on the basis that there are &#39;shortages&#39; and no offices are seeing adhd patients because of them. <br/><br/>Everyone deserves equal access to the medications that manage their disorder, but the shortages are affecting more than just those seeking their stimulants.

I began undergoing treatment for ADHD a few months ago and have been taking generic Vyvanse for much of that time. I was personally affected by this artificial shortage in January 2024 when my CVS could no longer fill my prescription due to lack of inventory (of both brand and generic Vyvanse). I was forced to then go without medication as I had to then create a new appointment with my prescriber to discuss alternatives. My prescriber recommended another medication, Mydayis, but this drug was not covered by my insurance plan. Fortunately, I was granted a temporary override by my insurance, and was able to finally fill a prescription for Mydayis. However, these disruptions each represented significant hurdles in my daily activities. It can and should be much easier to fill a prescription in the United States with the significant manufacturing ability at our disposal, but our ability to manufacture drugs is moot due to artificially created shortages which cause harm to patients and inconvenience prescribers.

Medicine is a game changer for not just their education, but their emotional and social well-being. The burden on parents of kids with ADHD is two-fold, firstly, raising kids with ADHD is harder in every way and adds a layer of complexity to every layer of parenting. Secondly, most parents of kids with ADHD have ADHD themselves. This shortage is exacerbated by the way ADHD (class 2) drugs are controlled. ADHD meds are not allowed the standard ten days of extra meds that many people have on medication. We have to monitor and watch down to the wire. So when there is a problem with our standard pharmacy (10 minutes from our home) being out, we are stuck having to call individual pharmacies (who are themselves chronically under staffed and usually leave us on hold for 20+ minutes... this is labor that has to be done during work hours, effectively taking time out of my career) searching for pharmacies might have the rx in stock (and many pharmacists won&#39;t share this knowledge with you, for fear of robberies??). Next, I have to get in touch with my son&#39;s pediatrician, who has to pull the rx from the other place and resend it to the new place. Then we are in the standard &quot;waiting for it to get filled.&quot; When his rx is supposed to run out on a weekend, we are left with no options at all. Just skipping a pill isn&#39;t considered acceptable for *ANY OTHER MEDICINE* but apparently for ADHD FOR A VULNERABLE CHILD, that&#39;s just ok.

As someone who relies on ADHD medication, the past few months have been particularly challenging due to the scarcity of these medications in my county. The need to contact multiple pharmacies in search of available stock, only to face long hold times and often no resolution, exacerbates the situation. This process is not only time-consuming but also adds to the stress and difficulty of managing ADHD symptoms without medication.<br/><br/>The lack of a centralized database to check medication availability across pharmacies has left me and many others in a precarious position, often having to switch to alternative medications. This switch, while necessary, comes with its own set of challenges, including adjusting to new side effects and the uncertainty of efficacy. The disruption caused by these shortages and the need to constantly adapt to new treatments cannot be overstated.<br/><br/>I urge the FTC to consider the real-life implications of drug shortages on individuals with ADHD. It is crucial to address the underlying issues contributing to these shortages, including the lack of competition and problematic contracting practices within the pharmaceutical supply chain. Strategies to improve transparency and accessibility of medication stock information across pharmacies could greatly alleviate the burden on patients.<br/><br/>Furthermore, fostering a more competitive environment that discourages exclusivity and encourages a steady supply of generic drugs could help prevent future shortages. It is essential that the voices of patients affected by these shortages are heard and that concrete steps are taken to ensure that necessary medications are accessible to those who need them most.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this critical issue.",

This is ridiculous and once a year should be fine. <br/><br/>The control of this drug on top of the limited supply has caused me to look elsewhere such as looking for natural supplements to help with my ADHD. <br/><br/>You wouldn&rsquo;t question someone who needs their insulin, so stop questioning those who actually need this drug. It&rsquo;s been life altering to say the least that I have still not been able to find it consistently after a year that I&rsquo;ve given up for the time being. That just means more loss of money for the government. ",

    "text": "My adult daughter has been prescribed Adderall for about ten years (since mid-college). The change in her ability to function, personally and professionally, is striking - she went from being unable to wash her hair and change her clothes, let alone do her schoolwork, to graduating from law school and succeeding in a stressful and responsible position.  Her ability to do all of that, let alone to maintain her mental health and personal relationships, is completely dependent on her medication.  Yet, our ability to obtain that medication is precarious at best - every month, we are both stressed, making endless phone calls and driving endless miles in hopes of finding a pharmacy that can fill her prescription, in  some form.  The fact that it is a controlled substance adds to the stress - pharmacists cannot give us information over the phone, and the meds cannot be refilled in advance so we have to plan our lives to be in town for days around the time of the refill (since we can&#39;t count on the refill on the right day).  We have tried all sorts of pharmacies, - large national chains, pharmacies inside grocery stores, Costco, independent pharmacies, mail order.  They all have precarious supplies, and many have resorted to filling only their existing customers -  but  even they cannot count on refills and are prevented by this rule in other pharmacies from searching elsewhere.  We have tried all combinations of dosages - anything that will add up (more or less) to her correct dosage.  She needs both an IR and an ER dose, so we look for both; she is indifferent between generic and brand, but we generally turn up generic.  There is no consistency about who has it  - every month, we have to call multiple pharmacies of various types to find any version of her meds.  If they don&#39;t happen to have it, they have no idea when it will come in.  If they do, the race begins to get the prescription transmitted before the meds go to someone else (thank goodness we have a cooperative prescribing doctor, any delay leads to having to start the  search from scratch).  Bottom line: there is definitely and obviously a significant shortage, and has been for far longer than I&#39;m hearing from websites - we&#39;re on at least year 2, I can&#39;t imagine how the government is hearing there is not - a couple of visits to pretty much any pharmacy (or a web search, or lurking in the relevant Reddit threads) will convince you there is a huge problem. I have many friends who face this issue, for themselves and their children all over the country; it is a frequent topic of conversation.  This is causing life-changing/destroying consequences for people who, ironically, suffer from a disorder that makes planning ahead and organizing an approach, especially without the meds in shortage, a huge struggle.  This is affecting the stress level and mental health, and consequently the economic, social and family stability, of so many people who, with their meds, are perfectly fine and functional members of society. This is an emergency - please fix this.",

    "text": "I was recently diagnosed with ADHD as a 35-year old adult. Finding a medication that works for me has truly been life changing, and I do not say that lightly. I&#39;m a mom, wife, business owner and preschool teacher. The order that I feel in my brain is incredible and helpful in actually getting through all the things that need to get done. But it is very hard to keep up on all the things needed to obtain this medication. <br/><br/>Having to remember to make a doctor&#39;s appointment, go to it, receive the paper prescription, turn it in to the pharmacy and return to the pharmacy to pick it up, is counter-intuitive for a person with adhd who struggles with time management and executive functions. <br/><br/>The process we need to go through is because this drug has been abused by others, but in order to keep this medication out of the wrong hands, it is making it difficult for people who actually need it to function in our busy world. <br/><br/>All of this work is what it takes when everything is running smoothly. And that is not often. If I remember to do everything needed, appointment/paper prescription/pharmacy drop off, I often run into issues at that point. The pharmacy is out of stock, the pharmacy only has the name brand but my insurance won&#39;t cover that one, all the stores nearby are also out of stock of the generic. Once I do find a pharmacy that has the medication, I run into the problem of my prescription company not being accepted by that store/pharmacy. This happened once that it took a couple weeks to resolve even when I had my doctors assistant on my side making phone calls and actively trying to help me find a solution. <br/><br/>Another issue can happen when a person loses insurance. My husband was in a work accident, was put on leave while working through PTSD from the accident and we lost our insurance and main income unexpectedly. I applied for OHP, received it a few weeks later, but had to find a new doctor who could prescribe the medication that I had already been using. Finding a new doctor and getting in to the first appointment is a lengthy process. I tried to be as quick as possible but I could not get the medication prescribed and insurance to pay for it for a couple months. I ended up paying out of pocket for a doctor&#39;s appointment that was no longer covered by insurance and then paid 300 dollars for the medication that was no longer covered. In a time where money was already stretched thin, this caused an increase in anxiety and overwhelm on top of the already chaotic home-life with a spouse who could barely function after his work accident. I scrounged the money together to make it work, because this medication helps me function on a day-to-day basis. I know that ADHD has long been used to explain why young kids bounce off the walls at school, but research has found that this is an issue that is effecting far more people and in ways that just were not seen before. Being able to consistently be on this medication is important to me and my family, my business and the multiple families I work with in my preschool. <br/><br/>Drug shortages, insurance incompatibilities, generic vs brand cost, lengthy processes to even obtain the prescription and each prescription only being good for that one month... makes for a stressful process every month and results in an even more exhausted mom/business woman.",

Since late 2023, I have spent hours calling different pharmacies in my area to find somewhere that has the drug I need in stock, usually to no avail. This is true for multiple big pharmacy chains. The fact that insurance doesn&rsquo;t want to cover the name brand now that the generic is out compounds the issue, as the name brand can be far more expensive even with private health insurance. If it is regulations impacting availability of these drugs, I would strongly urge reconsideration of these regulations. These drug shortages have significant impacts on my physical health, quality of life, and mental well-being. Stimulants such as Vyvanse and its generics are the gold standard for ADHD treatment in both children and adults, and there is no reason they should be so difficult to access. ",

This month, if all goes well,  it looks like I&rsquo;ll be filling my script at a pharmacy not covered by my insurance, where I&rsquo;ll pay 5x my copay. At this point, I am happy to find my meds before running out and with only a few hours spent calling around. I have been relatively lucky, overall. <br/>Thanks to 24 years of effective treatment, I entered higher ed as a first generation undergrad and am now a successful clinical psychologist. I specialize in addiction treatment, opioid use disorder in particular. Because of this, I know that the overdose crisis happened largely because people who were cut off from their safe medication entered a poisoned ILLICIT drug market. <br/>Most illicit Adderall is now methamphetamine, and cross contamination between meth and fentanyl is common. As teen overdoses spike, it seems likely that &ldquo;ADHD med shortage -&gt; illicit stimulants&rdquo; is one path by which we are losing some of these young people. <br/>I received my diagnosis at a turning point in my teens, and it was critical to helping me reach my academic and professional potential. I am now a mental health provider at a time of provider shortages and high need. <br/>I am deeply disappointed to see the regulatory bodies whose overreaction to pharma&rsquo;s unethical opioid push led to vast amounts of suffering and countless overdose and suicide deaths enthusiastically repeating their mistakes. I am in disbelief as I watch a well documented failure get replayed by the same agencies. This time, even more young folks are being harmed by it. <br/>Your policies are not preventing mis-diagnosed people from accessing medications, you don&rsquo;t have tools that refined. Any effort to create them would just harm folks who are already at risk. <br/>I believe the &ldquo;middle man&rdquo; issue is the reason I&rsquo;m filling my script this month without insurance coverage. I don&rsquo;t know who is benefitting from or profiting off of this prolonged shortage. If it&rsquo;s a battle of wills between government regulators and profit-driven pharmaceutical companies, only one of those entities is beholden to the safety and well being of US citizens. Further, the regulations in place have already caused harm via many overdose and suicide deaths. Kids are struggling in school, adults are losing jobs and driving less safely, and we&rsquo;re coming up on two years of watching federal agencies double down on terrible, harmful policies. You are punishing people like me and many children for what you perceive to be &ldquo;over diagnosis.&rdquo; You have done nothing to protect me, diagnosed in 2002 and treated since that time, from the fallout.

Most times I am unable to pick my ADHD prescription up until I have run out, and with my schedule, I have to go unmedicated until it is possible to get it. ofMy medication, even with insurance, is 77 dollars monthly. I have also had my insurance company decide at random to stop covering my necessary medication. I suffer emotionally and physically without the proper resources. This needs to be fixed.

It is tiresome being treated like a criminal or addict every time I have to refill my medication.  It can&rsquo;t be refilled ahead of time (literally on the 30 day mark only), so if there is a shortage, it means going without medication for an often undetermined amount of time - 3 weeks at times.  People who actually need the medication are made to sacrifice their mental health and productivity as a consequence of the behaviors of people who abuse the medications.  You can&rsquo;t keep a few pills aside &ldquo;just in case,&rdquo; because there is no overlap allowed in the prescription timeline.  The only way to do that would be to go without your meds.  Would the government ask a diabetic to skip insulin and risk a health crisis so they can have some in case of shortage? It is a very frustrating and stressful process every single month.  I spoke to my doctor about it this month and she said the regulations are getting MORE strict, not less.  There has to be a way to facilitate long-term patients who have been stable and who safely use these meds to be able to get these medications every month and with some flexibility for overlap in case of shortages.

    "text": "In the context of addressing drug shortages, particularly for vital medications such as Vyvanse, used in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), it is imperative to scrutinize and address the underlying factors contributing to these shortages. The solicitation for public comment by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the lack of competition and contracting practices that may be contributing to drug shortages presents a critical opportunity to advocate for the increased supply of Vyvanse. <br/><br/>The shortages of Vyvanse not only impede the treatment regimen of individuals living with ADHD but also reflect broader systemic issues within the pharmaceutical supply chain that demand comprehensive analysis and action. The ADHD community faces significant challenges due to these shortages, including disrupted treatment continuity, which can severely impact daily functioning, academic performance, and overall quality of life. It is, therefore, paramount to address the root causes of these shortages through a multi-faceted approach focusing on the dynamics of competition, contracting practices, and regulatory frameworks governing the pharmaceutical industry.<br/><br/>The role of Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) and drug wholesalers is central to this discussion. These entities, by their operational nature, have the potential to significantly influence the availability and pricing of generic drugs, including Vyvanse. The current contracting practices, including exclusive agreements, most-favored nation clauses, and rebidding provisions, may inadvertently create barriers to market entry for new suppliers or disincentivize the production of certain medications. This can lead to a reduction in competition, which is a critical factor in drug shortages. Moreover, the compensation models employed by GPOs, which often rely on rebates and administrative fees, can distort the market dynamics, potentially leading to prioritization of certain drugs over others based on profitability rather than clinical necessity.<br/><br/>To mitigate the shortage of Vyvanse and similar medications, it is essential to encourage policies and practices that promote competition, transparency, and innovation within the pharmaceutical supply chain. This includes reevaluating the protections for GPOs under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute to ensure they do not inadvertently contribute to reduced competition or the prioritization of financial incentives over patient care. Additionally, fostering an environment that incentivizes the entrance of new manufacturers into the market, and ensuring that contracting practices do not restrict access to affordable, high-quality drugs, are critical steps towards addressing the current shortages.<br/><br/>Moreover, implementing policies that encourage investment in manufacturing quality systems can significantly reduce the incidence of drug shortages. Quality issues are a major cause of drug production halts, leading to shortages. Ensuring that manufacturers maintain high-quality production standards is essential for the continuous supply of medications like Vyvanse. <br/><br/>Agressively ddressing the shortage of Vyvanse requires a concerted effort to understand and reform the contracting practices, competition dynamics, and regulatory frameworks governing the pharmaceutical industry. By fostering an environment that encourages competition, transparency, and quality investment, it is possible to ensure a steady and reliable supply of essential medications like Vyvanse, thereby safeguarding the health and well-being of individuals with ADHD.",

    "text": "I was diagnosed with ADHD at 36 yrs old this past November. When talking to my provider about starting treatment with medication, I brought up my concern with the ADHD drug shortages I heard about. She confirmed to me that yes, while her patients have had some issues, its usually been patients who live outside a populated area. I live in Portland, OR. I am a 5 min walk to my closest pharmacy (Walgreens), which of course makes it very convenient. After some other discussion with my provider, I agreed to start medication at a lower dose (10mg XR to start). With my current insurance, I am only able to get the name brand of my medication, Adderall, because of some deal my health insurance has with the manufacturer. This will come into play later. Since starting my medication, I have felt the benefits of it to my ADHD. The best way I can describe my progress since starting my medication, is that my brain feels like I am finally in tune with the right signals, instead of playing with rabbit ear antennas where I felt scrambled and messy. <br/><br/>However, even though I live in a populated area and was told I shouldn&#39;t have much trouble getting my medication compared to others in smaller areas, refilling my medication has been nothing but stressful. Each month, I can only hope that my 5 min of a walk to Walgreens will have my current prescribed 20mg dose of Adderall XR. United Healthcare, my current health insurance, won&#39;t accept generics. So when I call ahead to check available stock, part of the time it will be either Adderall or the generic in stock, not the correct dose, or out completely. It seems to rotate evenly between those outcomes and its frustrating. And since the drug I&#39;ve been prescribed is a controlled substance, I can&#39;t really get it a few days ahead. So if I check in the day or 2 beforehand for stock availability, it could be out by the time I get the refill sent by my provider. Then I&#39;m back at square one, where I have to call other Walgreens to check their stock, hopefully not getting judged as some drug fiend (which has unfortunately happened before), finding one that does have the exact dose then call my provider&#39;s office and hopefully she will get my message and transfer my prescription to the Walgreens that has my meds in stock. The past 2 months now, I have had to deal with random temporary closures or not getting my provider to switch it fast enough where I&#39;ll be days without my medication. Days where I don&#39;t have it, I have become more anxious (I also was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder with my ADHD), worried, and less focused. I&#39;m sure other comments of people diagnosed with ADHD have very similar stories. It is commonly talked about in various ADHD groups both online and in-person. We just want our medications when we need them, because they help us live. <br/><br/>My employer recently announced that they are switching health insurance from United Healthcare to Aetna as of April 1st due to cost savings. While the plans they offer are 1:1 to my current plan with United Healthcare and my providers are all accepted, Aetna will not cover my Adderall XR 20mg. They will only cover the generic version of the drug. While I have no problem with going from name brand to a generic as long as I get the same effects, I am again back at square one. When I have called various Walgreens in the past asking about medication stock, most of the time they seem to be out of the generic version of my drug, but they might have Adderall (not the correct dose or the IR version). <br/><br/>Hopefully there will be enough comments with people telling their stories to prove that this really is a bigger concern than some may say. I hope the FTC &amp; HHS can get to bottom of this, not just for us with ADHD medication issues, but everyone who experience medication shortages. It leads to nothing but stress and anxiety, which nobody needs more of.",

That may be the only medication that works for a particular person.  There is so much talk about big pharma being so greedy.  While I agree with this, I know one medication that I take the cost of the medication doubles once it goes through the supplier and the pharmacy.  I know most generic drugs will see a yearly price increase of 5% or less, but I have seen the cost double in the middle of the year.  So the suppliers and pharmacies are increasing prices outpacing inflation.  If pharmaceutical companies make small profit margins on generic medications what motivation do they have to continue to make it and watch suppliers keep lining their pockets.  Most chain pharmacies are contracted to a particular supplier so there is no &quot;finding the best price&quot;.  People need affordable, available medications.

When you have 2 kids who rely on their medication to be able to function on a daily basis for school, it&rsquo;s difficult when the pharmacy is constantly out of stock. We had found the right medications and dosages for them both, so having to change the type or dosage is not going to help. Additionally, when our pharmacy is out of stock we are advised to &ldquo;call around&rdquo; to see who has it in stock. This has several issues. First, when I call different pharmacies to see who has the meds in stock, some will tell me if they have it, but others refuse unless the prescription is already on file with them. So, if they say they have it and I call back to the doctor&rsquo;s office to have it transferred (because even if it&rsquo;s the same chain pharmacy, they can&rsquo;t transfer it) by the time the doctor&rsquo;s office gets around to sending it to the other location, that location is already out of stock, even on the same day!  This is a ridiculous process that I have to repeat month after month so that my children have access to medication that helps them be able to function. And I continue to do this same process every month because my children deserve to be able to get their prescribed medication that actually helps them.  It does, however, come at the expense of my mental health and stress level. I understand that the pharmacy employees are probably so tired of getting the daily phone calls, but the amount of extremely rude responses I get are difficult to take. I know they are frustrated as well, so I am always kind and respectful, I just don&rsquo;t always get the same treatment in return. Someone needs to do something about the shortages so those that just want to take the medicine prescribed by their doctor can do exactly that. Thank you for your time.  ",

    "text": "Root causes of current shortages in the US drug supply chain have their origins with a few factors that have developed over the course of the past 15 years:<br/><br/>(a) Consolidation of purchasing power amongst Payers/PBM&#39;s and wholesalers driving prices to an unsustainable low point achievable only by the lowest bidders (currently three to 4 conglomerates control over 85% of demand in the market), <br/><br/>(b) Globalization of manufacturing and flight of US based manufacturing - a large part of manufacturing has relocated to India and China where low manufacturing costs and lower regulatory standards render such activity much more cost-competitve than in the US. This is resulting in US Based manufacturers closing their doors or opting to move/outsource operations offshore to countries like India and China where costs are low and accountability regulatory / tax / social even lower.<br/><br/>(c) Predatory contracting practices disadvantaging manufacturers from taking risks and bidding on awards on products where market pricing is low, for example: Most Favorite Nation (MFN) clauses, unfavorable payment terms 2 to 3% of WAC on 60 up to 95 days (essentially manufacturers being required to pre-finance wholesalers), Failure to Supply Clauses (but conversely no &quot;Failure To Buy&quot; clauses forcing wholesalers to commit to awards commitments) - etc.. etc..<br/><br/>(d) The 2019 Pandemic and Geo-political adversities driving de-globalization trends (conflict between NATO and Russia, tensions with China, proxy conflicts in the middle east) are straining global supply chains.<br/><br/>The solution to these challenges is complex and may require a &quot;CHIPs&quot;-like government-led initiative to protect the sustainability and resiliency of the US based Pharma Supply chain from permanent disruption.",

I can only speak for myself as to why I believe stimulants to be the best medication for treating ADHD symptoms. Without it, my impulsivity, concentration, appetite (seek dopamine through binging food), time management, awareness, task management, and quality of sleep are affected negatively. Of the four people (including myself) who take medication for their ADHD, within the last two years, all four of us have been impacted by unavailable medication for more than three days. One of these individuals on Concerta went without for over six months in 2022-2023 when the pharmacy informed them it was indefinitely unavailable. My most recent impact was for generic Vyvanse, 50 mg. I was on the second week of my new job in a stressful work environment in education in special education. Other children were also unable to take their medication because it was also not available. I went the entire week without any medication, and ultimately had to switch to Adderall XR because as of today, the generic and non for Vyvanse remains unavailable at my pharmacy. I was not told any information as to when it would be in, so it&rsquo;s really a game of chance. All while we are expected to function normally and our responsibilities do not cease.

    "text": "Even though I have been prescribed Atomexitine for years, I have been through HELL trying to get it filled at the pharmacy. I first started having this issue when I moved to Houston, TX in August 2023. My psychiatrist would send my Atomexitine prescription to HEB Pharmacy. I would go to the pharmacy and they would tell me they &ldquo;might&rdquo; receive a batch within a week. I would anxiously call every single day to ask if they had received a new batch of Atomexitine. Sometimes the answer was yes, but they could only give me a small amount of pills - much less than the 2 month dose my doctor ordered for me. Another time I had to drive an hour away to a neighboring city to get my prescription! I am diagnosed with Bipolar I, ADHD, and PTSD. The last thing I need is more stress in my life! <br/>Due to this national shortage of Atomexitine I had to go without the pill for two whole months. During this time I had two major panic attacks where I hyperventilated. I had not experienced one of those in YEARS. I also got severe muscle cramps from being so uptight in my sleep and having night terrors. I was taking all my other regularly prescribed pills during this time but not having the Atomexitine made it impossible for me to function on a day-to-day basis. <br/>I had to completely change doctors so I would be guaranteed to have Atomexitine. I go to The Harris Center because it has a built-in pharmacy. It also accepts my Marketplace insurance plan. I can still tell there is a national shortage though. My doctor prescribes my psychiatric medications to last for two months until my next appointment. The other three pill bottles I receive last me those two months. I always receive half that amount of the Atomexitine. <br/>It is absolutely unacceptable that people like me who desperately need this pill to function in society cannot access their medication. I do not know what you need to do to fix this situation, but you need to figure it out!! It is unfair for a mentally ill person to go to the doctor and walk out without their prescription. <br/>I was not working during those two months I did not have Atomexitine because I could not! Even when I was getting care from The Harris Center I would forget that I only had half the supply of Atomexitine. I would ask for a refill a bit too late. On the days I did not have it, I had to miss work or leave early because I could not focus whatsoever! Going to work without taking my Atomexitine caused me to drop products and break them, interrupt customers, and get lost within my workplace.<br/>I am on the lowest dose (25 mg) but this pill (in combination with the others I take) allow me to be a functional, contributing member of society. Please fix this national shortage. It has been over 6 months now. Those of us who cannot get our medication are in crisis. Our inability to access and take our medication as prescribed affects our friends, family, and society as a whole. <br/>Thank you. ",

I would wait to respond until my prescription is refilled, at which time I would be more capable of comprehending the overwhelming word-soup on the form I&rsquo;m looking at, but the pharmacy has no way of knowing if they&rsquo;ll be able to change that in the next 60 days.  If the government could do ANYTHING to improve the predicament myself and the people in my community find ourselves struggling with, it would certainly be very appreciated.  Not only do we suffer from extreme cognitive incompatibility with the society we have no choice but to participate in, but we are also extraordinarily misunderstood and our difficulties are trivialized and are widely considered negligible.  For many, these shortages are an ongoing existential threat; without medication many simply cannot function- that includes working to continue paying rent, provide for families, and even feed ourselves.  <br/><br/>Also, if there&rsquo;s any motivation left on Capitol Hill after that&rsquo;s sorted, it would be great if there could be something done about the public education system&rsquo;s ability to effectively recognize the symptoms of ADHD beyond the stereotype of boys who can&rsquo;t stay in their seat it would probably save A LOT of people a lifetime of pain and the state and federal government even more money.

It&#39;s now been over three months of taking a generic that doesn&#39;t work, with a 1-2 week delay in between refills because of the shortage. I really just want to be a productive member of society again. This is exhausting and we&#39;re so exhausted. <br/><br/>Thank you. ",

    "text": "I am a 32 year old with ADHD. Over the last year, the shortage of lisdexamphetamine has affected my ability to acquire and afford my monthly generic Vyvanse prescription. Since November, my regular pharmacy, CVS, has not had Vyvanse or generic Vyvanse in stock anywhere in the city I live. The only pharmacy I could find who had generic Vyvanse in-stock was not in-network with my insurance. I have previously tried Concerta, Ritalin, and Adderall XR, and did not find them effective at managing my ADHD, whereas generic Vyvanse has managed my symptoms well. Therefore, since November, I have paid the full-cost of my prescription every month, a hardship for me on as a low-income individual. Additionally, because ADHD medication is highly regulated, I can get only a month&rsquo;s supply at a time, and I am not able to pick up my prescription until two days before the last one runs out. This makes trying to find a pharmacy with the medication in-stock very difficult on such short notice.<br/>These effects are very tough when they result in sudden lack of medication and withdrawal symptoms. Especially since my doctor has never recommended quitting my ADHD medication immediately, instead tapering me down in dosage. Due to my insurance changing unexpectedly right when I needed to pick up my month&rsquo;s medication, I have experienced the effects of immediately stopping medication. For a week and a half, while my insurance was still being sorted, my sudden lack of ADHD medication significantly affected my emotional and mental capacity to manage my life while my brain tried to refigure how to operate without medication. My depression and emotional instability spiked during this sudden cut-off. The medication shortage makes tapering impossible, if suddenly you can&rsquo;t find the medication you need in two days or less. <br/>Because ADHD stimulants are so highly regulated and their withdrawal effects so sharp, it is hard to understand how it is acceptable to provide these medications to patients without ensuring there is adequate supply available regularly.",

I was on generic Adderall and it was delayed for several day to multiple weeks every time I would go to pick it up. So my doctor switched me to vyvanse and that was readily available bt it was also 300-400 dollars per months supply. Then the patent expired and all the pharmacists assured me it would actually get easier to get because now we would have multiple manufacturer making including several generics and the original branded version. Well, that was a lie. Because the day it went generic the original company stopped production of the original and only one company decided it was profitable to make a generic. So now we&rsquo;re back to a single manufacturer and I am waiting at minimum several day extra for each prescription. And since it is controlled I cannot call a few days early to compensate. So for a third time my doctor is going to try switching to a new drug that is a gamble if it will be effective or have any side effects. The it will take me multiple months to find a dosage that works for me since all the different drugs do not have standard conversion rates or absorption uptake. Wish me luck! ",

    "text": "In the last year and a half, I have had exactly two months in which my medication was filled on time. This month, likely only because stock came in that day, and March 2023. To get the medication that is critical for my function as someone with what my psychiatrist describes as &quot;weapons grade ADHD&quot;, I have had to bounce between different medications, call multiple pharmacies, and pay out of pocket for the more expensive brand name drug. In one instance, United Health Care/Optum Rx ONLY covered the brand, forcing me to pay $60 for my medication. When they switched to the generic Vyvanse, the price remained the same, and they dropped coverage for brand. <br/><br/>At that time, my psychiatrist switched me back to Adderall XR. We originally switched away from this because it was hard to get with my previous insurance provider, Cigna. UHC/Optum covered brand name Adderall XR for $25/30 day supply. While it was still filled late, it was only a 1-3 days late versus 4-7 business days. Regardless, I started rationing capsules to ensure that I had my medication for work days. At the end of 2023, I received a letter stating that UHC no longer covered brand Adderall XR for no good reason. Back to square one with filling my ADHD meds in a timely manner. January 2024, my medication was filled five business days late. Fortunately, I only missed a day because I started skipping a day a week three months prior.<br/><br/>Skipping can be detrimental. It&#39;s difficult for me to function those days. Breathing, feeding myself, and taking naps is the extent of what I&#39;m good for. Driving is unwise, as my meds keep my brain quiet enough to focus on the road. I struggle to adhere to social norms and act like a &quot;normal&quot; person. I talk too much, I forget what I&#39;m doing halfway through a task. I struggle to regulate my emotions. These are all common issues with ADHD that are well-managed with medication. That is a WHOLE day of lost productivity as a semi-functional sentient dumpster fire.<br/><br/>While that may not seem to be much to the neurotypical person, it can feel like weeks for someone with ADHD. I&#39;ve been lucky and able to fill my meds within a few weeks. There are others in other states and countries that are waiting a month or more to get their prescription.<br/><br/>Without my ADHD medication, I could easily lose my job. I could cause a car accident. I could irreparably damage relationships with friends, family, and coworkers. The average person describes ADHD medication as legal meth, but that&#39;s not the case. These stimulant medications do not have the same &quot;zoom&quot; effect on us that it does someone who&#39;s neurotypical. It calms our chaotic brains and quiets the excruciatingly loud thoughts.<br/><br/>You would not tell someone who was diabetic, &quot;Oh, sorry. The distributors won&#39;t share and reallocate their remaining active ingredient. No glucophage/insulin/Trulicity for you.&quot; Oh, wait. That&#39;s what happened with Ozempic. <br/><br/>Honestly, the FDA and the American health care system are an absolute disgrace. Patients shouldn&#39;t be waiting weeks on meds because greedy pharma companies and asinine or outright useless drug regulations disrupt the supply chain or whatever garbage the public is fed. Unfortunately, these issues extend far beyond stimulant medication for ADHD. It&#39;s just what I&#39;m the most familiar with due to my condition.<br/><br/>We&#39;re given these vague, non-committal answers when we ask why or how much longer. It keeps getting pushed back further and further. First, it was said to be rectified in October 2022, then Summer 2023, then Winter 2023, Spring 2024, and now we&#39;re looking at early 2025. I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll be updated to Winter 2026 before the start of summer. <br/><br/>Monitoring the drug shortage database is a waste of time because it&#39;s never correct. Shortages that are said to be resolved are ongoing. Uncle Sam points fingers at drug companies. Drug companies point fingers at Uncle Sam. Someone needs to take responsibility and rectify the situation. Patients deserve better than this.  ",

I have undergone intensive neuropsych testing and my husband and two children have undergone independent evaluations that each resulted in individual ADHD diagnosis. It has been hard. It&rsquo;s an expensive process. It is hard managing the symptoms and coming to terms with a diagnosis. It&rsquo;s also hard finding the right treatment. Therapy is expensive and finding a therapist let alone the right therapist is difficult. Making the decision to medicate is also difficult, especially when it&rsquo;s for your children. Once you decide to try medication, finding the right meds is even more difficult. It&rsquo;s time consuming and mentally challenging, there is a stigma and it&rsquo;s expensive. It impacts every aspect of your life and the challenges are often exaggerated throughout the process. All of these challenges are to be expected. A government manufactured drug shortage should not be an additional hurdle, yet it is. It is unacceptable that a healthcare provider who has been educated and board certified and makes a recommendation for mediation, cannot ensure their patient has access to it. It is unacceptable that a child who need neck agipm to success in school has to go without for days or weeks at a time. It is unacceptable that a working mother or father who need to provide for themselves and their families and cannot successfully do so without treatment, does not have access to it even with medical authority. ADHD is an under diagnosed disability that requires treatment to ensure suffers can fully contribute to their families and communities. Something has to change. ",

Without that medication, my daily life is severely impacted, as I am unable to focus and have less energy to be able to get the daily work done, and I know that I don&#39;t even have the worst of it.<br/>Due to this shortage, the longest I&#39;ve gone without my medication is a month, during which I was consistently tired, irritable, and unable to get my work done without significant delays due to lack of focus and energy that the medication gives me. In short, I was going through what appeared to be Adderall withdrawal, and withdrawal can be dangerous in people.<br/><br/>I urge you to look into this matter and correct it because of it&#39;s nature as an essentially money laundering scheme to jack prices up higher than they already are, cut supply down to the bare minimum, leaving many unable to get their medications due to financial or supply reasons, as well as the pharmaceutical industry&#39;s shoddy reasoning for it.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.",

    "text": "I haven&#39;t dealt with shortages directly but do feel the growing anxiety that it could happen to me. What is particularly difficult about this shortage is how stimulants are restricted, which adds to the anxiety. It feels like a constant fight with a system that cares more about preventing drug abuse than helping those who suffer without necessary medicine. It is a common complaint among people with ADHD that they can&#39;t call pharmacies and ask if they have their exact stimulant prescription in stock. Pharmacies say this is flagged as &quot;drug seeking behavior&quot; and tell patients to have their medical providers call, which is a ridiculous request considering how many patients a provider may have that need ADHD medication. And because stimulants are a restricted medication, I can only fill 30 days at a time, which means I constantly have to worry about running out of medicine before I can have it refilled. Many pharmacies can&#39;t transfer prescriptions for restricted drugs, so I&#39;d have to call my doctor and have them move my prescription to a different pharmacy before I even know if that pharmacy has my medicine in stock. I often worry that those in charge of these decisions, how ADHD medicine is scheduled, the restrictions on patients and providers, and the constant barriers to accessing treatment, simply aren&#39;t aware of how much this negatively impacts peoples lives. Without my stimulant medication I struggle to perform even basic tasks, like planning a meal, cleaning my home, or doing my job effectively. I also often worry that people who don&#39;t have ADHD underestimate the monumental struggle this disorder can cause. I know people who couldn&#39;t access stimulant medication, due to the shortage, who were fired for poor job performance. I know people who refuse to drive without medicine, because they struggle to focus while driving and are terrified they&#39;ll have a wreck. This shortage feels like a cruel joke at times, because a disorder that causes lack of focus, difficulty planning and executing tasks, and poor memory now has a complex obstacle course for accessing basic treatment.",

ADHD medication turned me from a dropout in high school to a person managing to get straight As in post secondary. Having access to my medication is seriously putting my future in jeopardy. I&#39;m stable on what I am on - yes, generics might be broadly the same, but minor changes can seriously destablize. I&#39;m an anxious mess on ritalin derivatives, but a fully functioning human on vyvanse - substituting one for the other seriously misunderstands how ADHD works. While I understand the need to prevent misuse, I think overcorrecting to the point where people with legitimate medical need cannot access the primary treatment that makes them less likely to be dependant on support systems such as welfare and disability is extremely short sighted. In the long run, ensuring those with diagnosed ADHD have access to medication will cost the taxpayer less money in the long run. If you don&#39;t care about any other reason - quality of life, access to mental health care, etcetera - policy makers should care because it can help those with legitimate disabilities be less reliant on government support. ADHD is one of the most treatable mental health disorders out there. Severely limiting supply is not only hurting those who deserve access to treatment but impacting the bottom line by depriving those with treatable conditions of the medication that can make them more independent. This is honestly a win-win, and I beg you to take a serious look with all recent research in mind.",

Interestingly the need to jump through extra hoops for ADHD medication has quite a bad effect with ADHD itself and makes it feel like the system is *designed* to punish people who struggle with the disorder. Strange controlled substance rules further contribute to the desperate struggle that this has been since I have been diagnosed. And on top of this, health insurance providers do not seem interested in allowing people to get brand-name medication if generics are not available (due to shortage). Failures everywhere in the chain. However shortages have occurred, this whole thing makes American healthcare really feel like a sick joke.  <br/><br/>I think at the minimum, insurance providers should be required to be more responsive to shortage situations like these and allow brand-name usage if generics are not available. I do think that some of the strictness around ADHD medication as controlled substances does much more harm than it does good, so relaxing things there would be nice, but the insurance situation is just unacceptable.
