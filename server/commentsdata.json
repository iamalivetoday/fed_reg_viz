    "text": "Greetings: First of all, I agree with the CFPB that mortgage loan closing costs have increased at an alarming rate over the past few years. I appreciate your taking the opportunity to look into this, as well as accepting feedback from those of us working in the mortgage industry. I just wanted to send you this commentary in order to provide the following observations as to why I think closing costs have increased dramatically over the last several years, from the perspective of an individual that works at a community bank that serves in both rural and urban Idaho, as well as parts of Northern Utah. 1. Title Insurance and Escrow Fees. There is no doubt that title insurance is important and provides research and protection for the borrower as well as the lender. But when you look at the amount of premiums that title companies collect versus the claims they pay out, they are drastically overcharging for the risk they take on. Title companies are supposed to be regulated by the state, but each state seems to be derelict in their duty and are not looking out for the best interests of their citizenry. In addition to title insurance, title companies perform a basic notary service at the time of the loan closing, but charge several hundred dollars under the guise of a “closing fee.” In addition, title insurance and escrow fees are based on loan amounts. As property values increase, so do loan sizes. As a result, their loan fees also have increased accordingly. 2. Appraisal Fees. A few years ago, appraisals only cost $350-400. Now they cost between $600-800. Appraisers have taken advantage of several variables to justify their increased fees. The appraisal industry has created an extremely difficult barrier to entry to become a licensed appraiser. Namely, to become an appraiser you must have an existing appraiser take you on as an apprentice. Appraisers refuse to take on apprentices because that will increase the number of appraisers in their service area, thus subsequently decreasing the amount of appraisal business they will receive once their apprentice becomes licensed and gets added to the appraisal rotation pool. The appraiser is basically punished financially with less appraisal orders by allowing more appraisers to work in their service area. As a result, the only time an appraiser will accept an apprentice is if the apprentice is related to them or is a close family friend. Thus, we continue to have existing appraisers that are using several reasons to justify their price increases because there is limited competition in their industry. The are, in effect, a small pool of appraisals with cartel-like powers to increase prices due to limited competition. 3. Credit Report Fees. Talking to several credit report vendors, I have been told that the monopolies of Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian have all conspired to increase credit report fees specifically in order to maintain revenue neutral year over year. The demand for credit reports has decreased dramatically as a result of higher interest rates as compared to the high refinance volume from super lower interest rates during the COVID19 pandemic. The greed of these three credit bureau monopolies is that they are engaging in price fixing to counteract the decrease in demand for credit reports to keep their profits high, despite the fact that everyone else working in the mortgage industry has had to make cuts in order to decrease costs as a result of less revenue coming in. As a result, if demand is down 300%, the solution is to increase their prices by 300% to counteract it. In addition, they made additional funds by selling credit inquiries (without allowing the consumer to opt in or opt out of this selling of their sensitive personal information) to other mortgage companies under the guise of trigger leads. As a result of this additional greed from the credit bureaus, customers who do make a credit inquiry are subsequently harassed by vendors that purchase these trigger leads. With the amount of money we are paying for credit reports, our customers should be exempt from this unwanted harassment that is specifically a result of the credit bureaus that are unregulated with their pricing trying to make more and more money as a result of greed. 4. Origination Fees. Origination fees, on account of their being 1% of the loan amount, typically account for a large percentage of the overall fees in a mortgage loan transaction. Origination fees have increased dramatically as a result of property values increasing dramatically. Since home costs have increased, the amount customers are borrower has increased. And the higher the amount of money that is being borrowed, the larger the origination fee. This has a direct result in closing costs increasing. As long as loan amounts increase, this portion of total loan closing costs will keep increasing as well. 5. Junk Fees. From a competitive standpoint, it is really frustrating to compete against other lenders that use “fake” fees in order to keep their origination fees deceptively low. This is both unfair to the customer and to the competing lenders. For example, a mortgage broker might have a combination of underwriting fees, administration fees, and processing fees which all combine for several thousands of dollars. A customer is not immediately aware of these actual junk fees, so when they are comparing one lenders rate and points (whether a 1% origination fee, or discount points, or a combination of both), they are not savvy enough to ask about what their underwriting fee and administration fees and processing fees are as a total amount. We always disclose that we have four categories of fees: third party fees (i.e. the required fees for services during the mortgage lending process that are charged to us for the transaction that are subsequently passed on to the borrower), escrow fees (i.e. prepaid interest, property taxes and hazard insurance, which fees are the same regardless of which lender you choose), rate dependent fees (points and/or origination fees that correspond with the available mortgage interest rate), and then actual bank fees (which in our case is just a processing fee). If the customer had disclosed to them just the rates and corresponding points as well as what the actual bank fees are, they would have a much easier time shopping between lenders and not being deceived by those lenders that charge thousands of dollars in bank fees when others do not. 6. New Loan Level Price Adjustments (i.e. LLPA’s). In 2022, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced targeted changes to the GSE’s pricing. A large swathe of borrowers that never before had to suffer loan level pricing adjustments were now being assessed with them based on the reformatting. In order for a borrower to get the lowest rate possible, that borrower is now required to pay the corresponding discount points to offset the fees that are being charged by the new loan level pricing adjustments. The significant increases in the loan level pricing adjustments are directly correlated with a significant increase in total closing costs because the financial institution has to pass on these increased costs directly to the consumer in order to maintain that desired interest rate and pricing combination. In addition, mortgage lenders are now required to display and quote interest rates on an “as low as” basis. To be competitive, lenders now have to quote an interest rate for a purchase loan that is dependent on a borrower having a 25% down payment and a minimum credit score of 780. Since very few borrowers possess those attributes, borrowers are left feeling frustrated because they eventually find out that they do not qualify for the best rate once they find out that the FHFA LLPA’s are punishing their credit and down payment situation. If a lender advertises a more normal interest rate scenario (i.e. 20% down and a 740 credit score), the lender will be at a complete disadvantage because their competitor is only advertising interest rates based on the most optimal loan conditions (higher credit and higher downpayment), and the borrower will naturally go to the institution with the lowest advertised interest rate, even though it is not even close to the interest rate that they will end up eventually qualifying for. The LLPAs are unfair and deceptive, as well as difficult for borrowers to know beforehand why their loan characteristics will potentially cost them additional funds and/or a higher interest rate than what is available to others. Here is an example of the loan level pricing adjustment increases from the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Prior to these increases, borrowers with 20% down payments on a purchase did not receive any corresponding rate and points penalty. With the change, the only way to avoid an increased fee for loan level price adjustments is to put 40% down. Since most borrowers are not able to meet that down payment obligation, loan fees have increased. In conclusion, it is my personal opinion that more oversight and regulation of title and escrow company fees and charges, lower barriers to entry for the appraisal industry, including increased regulation and scrutiny of credit reporting companies will most definitely help control mortgage loan closing costs in the future, as well as help lower them. In addition, a rollback of the loan level pricing adjustments to pre-2023 levels will also dramatically decrease the amount of fees a borrower has to incur to finance any and all mortgages. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to share my perspective with the CFPB.",

Recognizing the urgency for the U.S. health care sector to take climate action, hospitals and health systems are increasingly committing to reducing emissions and planning for climate resilience. For instance, more than 100 health organizations have signed the Department of Health and Human Services Health Sector Climate Pledge. While this momentum is encouraging, efforts to date are inadequate to fully address the climate crisis, and achieving health sector climate goals will require federal support and programs such as this Initiative. This Initiative positions the U.S. health care sector as a global leader in addressing the climate crisis and significantly strengthens current efforts to advance climate-smart healthcare. In addition, the Initiative can yield direct public health benefits, lead to potential cost savings for health care organizations, improve patient outcomes, and set the foundation for further health sector climate leadership. This Initiative has my full support and is a critical, significant step toward advancing low-emissions, climate-resilient health care across the U.S.",

Scheduling these drugs as a 1 really inhibits proper usage by the people who need it most.

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern: ALCOHOL IS MUCH MORE DANGEROUS TO HUMAN HEALTH THAN POT IS! I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis. In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.” Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol. Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

    "text": "While marketed as a tool to prevent drunk driving, this mandate poses significant threats to American citizens’ safety, privacy, and liberty. One of my primary fears is that the lack of ultimate control over one’s vehicle presents serious safety issues. Even with 99.9% accuracy, there could be a million false positives disabling vehicles every day. Disabling a vehicle while in motion on any roadway is dangerous for the occupants and others on the road. But if this were to occur on a high-speed route, it would be especially treacherous and could likely lead to a catastrophic outcome. Rather than being a tool to save lives, a “vehicle kill switch” could quickly become an instrument of death. The absence of mechanisms to challenge or stop the car from being disabled immediately puts drivers in potentially perilous situations without their consent or control. The use of the word “passively” in the legislation implies that this system will continually monitor vehicles and their passengers. Furthermore, the system must interface with a vehicle’s operational controls to disable the vehicle before or during driving when impairment is suspected. This open system, or one with a backdoor, potentially enables authorized or unauthorized third parties to access the system’s data at any time, raising concerns about safety and warrantless surveillance. For cars built after 2026, whether a vehicle can be driven at all will be determined by an algorithm over which the car’s owner or driver has neither knowledge nor control. This not only infringes on individual rights but also raises critical Constitutional issues. This mandate may infringe upon the 4th Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, the 5th Amendment’s right not to self-incriminate, and the 6th Amendment’s right to face one’s accuser, similar to the constitutional problems presented by other vehicle-related enforcement methods, such as traffic cameras and license plate readers. The ambiguity surrounding the term “impaired driving” in the legislation also raises questions about its implementation. Does it refer to legally drunk individuals, or does it encompass drivers who are “impaired” to some degree, even if they are under the legal limit? Would the “passive” system mistakenly target impaired passengers, making it impossible for a sober designated driver to operate the vehicle? Congress should have openly and thoroughly addressed these questions during the legislative process. Furthermore, the legislation lacks detail on who would have access to the data collected and stored by the system. Could law enforcement use it without a warrant? What about insurance companies eager to know how often their customers drive after consuming alcohol, even if they are well below the legal limit? I urge you to rethink this colossally bad idea and determine that this technology is too dangerous to implement.",

I beg you to do something to address this shortage. I cannot keep taking off work each month to hunt for medicine, and yet my son needs this to function. Please help.",

The ultimate goal for the neuromuscular disease community is to remain in their wheelchair throughout the flight. This is the safest and most dignified mode of transportation and will avoid unsafe seat transfers and damaged wheelchairs altogether. I strongly urge the Department to move forward with rulemaking that allows our community to fly within their wheelchair. Short of that, this proposed rule should improve the air travel experience for wheelchair users with neuromuscular diseases in several ways. First, both airline personnel who assist with seat transfers are sorely inadequately trained. This leads to folks with disabilities being twisted, dropped and injured. Baggage handlers responsible for stowing wheelchairs are also poorly trained causing wheelchairs to be damaged in loading, stowing, and unloading the wheelchair. These additional training requirements should involve those with disabilities, and if implemented and enforced well, should keep our community safe. Second, when wheelchairs are damaged or delayed, lives are upended due to missed connections, missed experiences, missed employment, and even injuries due to inadequate loaner wheelchairs. The Department should strictly enforce the airline’s responsibility for compensating for missed connection and lost time and wages, and should ensure wheelchairs are repaired and replaced as quickly as possible. We have waited long enough. I urge the Department to finalize as strong as possible of a rule as quickly as possible. The health and wellbeing of our community depends on it.",

    "text": "As an American citizen, I am concerned with the Drug Enforcement Administration’s proposal to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug. Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use. Rescheduling marijuana is unscientific and harmful. I ask that you recognize the downfalls of this type of policy and keep marijuana as a Schedule I drug.",

For instance, more than 100 health organizations have signed the Department of Health and Human Services Health Sector Climate Pledge. While this momentum is encouraging, efforts to date are inadequate to fully address the climate crisis, and achieving health sector climate goals will require federal support and programs such as this Initiative. This Initiative positions the U.S. health care sector as a global leader in addressing the climate crisis and significantly strengthens current efforts to advance climate-smart healthcare. In addition, the Initiative can yield direct public health benefits, lead to potential cost savings for health care organizations, improve patient outcomes, and set the foundation for further health sector climate leadership.

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis. In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.” Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower.

HUD’s proposed rule imposes strict limits on types of crimes I am allowed to evaluate in resident screening, narrows the lookback period to 3 years and makes it even harder to evict residents for legitimate reasons relating to criminal activity. We have had several cases of Tenants with Domestic violence issues that resulted in severe damages to the property as well as separation of the couple causing extreme financial distress and therefore thousands of dollars we had to absorb because collection agencies could not find these people. Some tenants have said this was not the first time of this behavior yet none of this history showed up on background checks. This rule would further degrade the truthfulness of background checks which would cause more uncollected damages making housing less affordable than it already is. Resident screening is an essential part of managing rental properties. Resident screening helps me to 1) provide quality housing, 2) mitigate financial risk to myself and members of our community, and 3) uncover “synthetic” fraud, a significant emerging issue for rental housing providers. If the federal government limits my ability to screen, this affects everyone, including my residents and staff, and significantly increases my liability and legal costs. Ultimately, this makes rental housing more difficult to provide and more expensive for everyone in my community. If this rule goes into effect as its proposed, I am certain this will significantly reduce landlord interest in these important housing programs. I sincerely urge you not to pursue these changes. Thank you for considering my views. Sincerely, Ron Kwiatkowski",

    "text": "Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

    "text": "The rescheduling of marijuana from its current classification as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act is not just a matter of policy, but a pressing issue of social justice, public health, and economic common sense. A Schedule I classification denotes that a substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and a lack of accepted safety under medical supervision. Marijuana, however, does not fit this description.<br/><br/>First, extensive research highlights the medical benefits of marijuana. It has been shown to effectively manage chronic pain, which is a significant public health issue affecting millions of Americans. According to a report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, there is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults. Additionally, marijuana has demonstrated efficacy in reducing muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis and alleviating nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, offering relief to cancer patients.<br/><br/>The safety profile of marijuana further challenges its Schedule I status. A comprehensive review by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that marijuana poses a relatively low risk of dependence compared to other Schedule I substances like heroin. It is also significantly safer than legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco, both of which contribute to substantial morbidity and mortality rates each year.<br/><br/>Moreover, the current classification of marijuana is inherently unjust. The enforcement of marijuana prohibition has disproportionately impacted marginalized communities, particularly African American and Latino populations. According to data from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), despite similar usage rates across racial groups, Black individuals are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than their white counterparts. This has led to devastating social and economic consequences, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana would also bring substantial economic benefits. Legalizing marijuana nationwide could generate billions in tax revenue, create thousands of jobs, and reduce the costs associated with enforcing marijuana prohibition. States that have legalized marijuana, such as Colorado and California, have already seen significant economic boosts and have been able to allocate funds to critical public services like education and healthcare. As a Massachusetts resident, I see articles every couple of months about how much money legalized cannabis is bringing in in the form of tax revenue and as a state currently facing a massive housing and migrant crisis among plentiful other issues, that money is extremely timely. <br/><br/>The current classification of marijuana as a Schedule I substance is scientifically unfounded, socially unjust, and economically detrimental. The rescheduling of marijuana to reflect its medical benefits, safety profile, and the need for equitable justice is not only a rational decision but a moral imperative. It is time for policymakers to act on the overwhelming evidence and public support for marijuana reform, and to rectify a historical wrong that has caused irreparable harm to countless individuals and communities.",

    "text": "The recent ADHD medication shortage has greatly affected me and my family in a number of ways. I was diagnosed with ADHD later in life (at 31 years old) and was prescribed Vyvanse to treat it. Taking the medication completely changed my life in a positive way. I finally felt like I was myself in I don’t know how many years. And having an invisible disability didn’t seem like that big of a deal anymore. But starting in January 2024 my medication was out of stock everywhere I checked. I felt reduced to a drug seeker and a criminal calling all of these places to try to find something that helped me feel like a normal human being. Without my ADHD medication, my other mental illnesses are heightened and I am really struggling. I work a full-time job, attend graduate school part-time, and intern part-time. This is my last semester and I am struggling through it. Up until this point, I loved school and everything about it, but now it is a burden. I feel like a burden. I’m consistently concerned about my job security which affects my family and ability to contribute to it. My mother-in-law also had ADHD and was impacted by the medication shortage for over a year and even resorted to using cocaine and unfortunately, died of an overdose 8 months ago. These medications are vital to us and our well-being and without them we feel lost and unable to live the life we envisioned for ourselves. Not having her in my life has made things even more difficult. These medications aren’t just for little boys and/or drug seekers. We need to help the drug manufacturers keep up with the increased demand. I pride myself in being different and neurodivergent, but the medication shortage makes me feel like I am put in a box and given a label that doesn’t feel good. Invisible disabilities are not taken seriously enough in this country and I think that is a major contribution to this shortage and lack of action to change it. I requested an ADA accommodation at my job for my invisible disability and was denied and given an alternative option for 90 days. So basically, my employer is telling me my invisible disability isn’t relevant and will be done and gone in 90 days. This is the kind of thing I am talking about. Please help us!",

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

Although there were some problems with flights cancelled during bad weather, that is true for most carriers because the airport is smaller etc. I looked at some reviews of Breeze Airways and the comments seemed very negative in terms of reliability of that airline. Their bigger planes aren&#39;t a benefit if there are regularly problems with their flights. Boutique Air flights as I and others have experienced out of Massena have been a total disaster and reliability is so bad, many of us never try to use that airline anymore because the huge percentage of the time the flight never goes. Please do not consider Boutique Air at all. Reliability is of upmost importance - if one can&#39;t count on a carrier to get us to the destination, we will just give up flying with them altogether.",

    "text": "I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362).<br/><br/>The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis &ldquo;has a currently accepted medical use&rdquo; and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.<br/><br/>HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.<br/><br/>Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients&rsquo; access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. <br/><br/>Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to &ldquo;move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, &ldquo;The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,&rdquo; such as benzodiazepines &mdash; a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, &ldquo;No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether &ndash; thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states &ndash; I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS&rsquo; recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS&rsquo;s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.",

This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.

Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking.

This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21&ndash;30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. <br/><br/>Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, &ldquo;adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.&rdquo;  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, &ldquo;Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores.

Kevin Maskomick, Division Director Community Meals Policy Division<br/>USDA Food and Nutrition Service<br/>1320 Braddock Place, Alexandria, VA 22314.<br/><br/>RE: Doc#2024-08369 Establishing the Summer EBT Program and Rural Non-Congregate Option in The Summer Meal Programs<br/><br/>Dear Director Maskomick,<br/><br/>As founding members of the Greater Williamsburg Hunger Coalition, we are writing to address the proposed summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) program revisions that define the non-congregate option in summer meal programs. The mission of the James City Lions Club is to help the Greater Williamsburg community through service. Hunger relief is one of our key goal areas. Our club of 81 service-minded volunteers work throughout the year to thwart the effects of food insecurity in our community in many ways. In particular, for the last three years we have delivered over 250 summer meals a day to children living in hotels and Section 8 housing through a donation-funded program run by our local Meals on Wheels. We deliver the meals directly to where hungry children live. This non-congregate program is ensuring that hundreds of children who qualify for free or reduced lunch during the school year receive nourishment during the summer months. <br/><br/>The USDA proposed revisions for the summer food service program are a step in the right direction. However, we recommend an additional change of the non-congregate meal rule provision to allow for both rural and urban regions to apply for USDA funding. As you know, poverty and food insecurity consistently overlap regardless of zip codes. Our community is a mixture of rural and urban areas. Children who live on one side of a road may be living in an area defined as rural while children living on the other side of the road may be living in an area defined as urban. Because their parents work during the day, transportation to &quot;congregate&quot; locations where meals are served is often not feasible. Non-congregate meal options are needed in both urban and rural areas. <br/><br/>According to recent Virginia Tidewater food distribution data, over 3,000 children need hunger relief in our area. The Meals on Wheels program reaches less than 10% of them. Due to limited funding, we are unable to provide meals to thousands who need it. If hunger relief organizations could apply for USDA funding regardless of whether children live in areas designated as rural or urban, we could feed more children experiencing food insecurity in our community. <br/><br/>Thank you for all that you do to reduce food insecurity. By expanding the Summer EBT Program to allow non-congregate options in both rural and urban areas we will be able to do so much more.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Lion Patti Ralabate, Ed.D.<br/>James City Lions Club President<br/>jamescitylionsclub@yahool.com",

The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal.

For example, with the increase in launches from the Kennedy Space Center and Patrick Space Force Station tourism has increased dramatically. Even though this is somewhat of an economic benefit to the area, it places immediate pressure upon local infrastructure that takes considerable time and money to accommodate and alleviate the strain. Roadways are congested for small cities such as Cape Canaveral which is already stressed from the increase in cruise traffic from Port Canaveral. Add to this any detrimental environmental impact to the area and long term viability of the local municipalities are in jeopardy. As more and more resources are funneled to the commercial space effort the increase in utilization places undue burdens upon small cities and their tax base.",

The first small observational study in Crohn&rsquo;s disease (N=30) was conducted by Naftali and colleagues in Israel in 2011. The researchers found that medical cannabis use was associated with a decrease in subjective disease activity scores and a reduced need for corticosteroid therapy. However, concerningly, the majority of patients discontinued conventional medical therapy while using medical cannabis.<br/>This study led to further investigation by Naftali and colleagues in the form of the first randomized, controlled trial of medical cannabis in Crohn&rsquo;s disease (N=21), the results of which were published in Clinical Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology in 2013. The study found that smoking 2 cannabis cigarettes per day for 8 weeks was associated with significant improvement in Crohn&rsquo;s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores compared to patients who were on placebo. Clinical remission was seen in 45% of patients on daily cannabis, and 25% were able to stop corticosteroid therapy. However, despite overall improvement in clinical symptoms in the cannabis group, the study failed to meet its primary endpoint of clinical remission. Cannabis use was not associated with an improvement in objective disease markers . Similar to previous retrospective research, cannabis use in this study was associated with improved overall satisfaction, quality-of-life scores, pain scores, and appetite.&rdquo;",

    "text": "Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362<br/>Dear DEA Officials,<br/><br/>I am writing to urge you to reschedule marijuana to at least Schedule III or, even better, remove it from the schedule entirely. Cannabis has medical benefits and is far less harmful and addictive than many drugs already in Schedule II, like fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It is also less harmful and addictive than alcohol and cigarettes, which are legal and widely used.<br/><br/>Over 40 states have already recognized the medical value of cannabis and allow its use. Many doctors and patients rely on it for relief from pain and other conditions. In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found strong evidence that cannabis is effective for treating chronic pain.<br/><br/>Unlike opioids and alcohol, cannabis does not cause deadly overdoses. Thousands of Americans die each year from opioid overdoses and excessive alcohol use, but deaths from cannabis are extremely rare. While some people can develop a mild dependence on cannabis, it is much less severe than withdrawal from alcohol or opioids, which can be fatal.<br/><br/>There is a misconception that marijuana is a gateway drug. Not true, cannabis can help people reduce their use of more dangerous substances like opioids and alcohol. It can be an exit drug, helping individuals wean off addictive and harmful drugs.<br/><br/>Cannabis has been used for thousands of years for its medical benefits. Since 1970, federal law has ignored this, causing unnecessary suffering for many. Major health organizations like the American Nurses Association, the American Public Health Association, and the Epilepsy Foundation support medical cannabis.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s time to face the facts: Cannabis is less harmful and less addictive than many legal substances. It should be rescheduled to at least Schedule III or, better yet, removed from the schedule completely. Like alcohol and cigarettes, it can be taxed and regulated. Let&rsquo;s stop the misconceptions and do what&rsquo;s right.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments.<br/>",

    "text": "I&#39;m writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 of the Controlled Substances Act. <br/><br/>I&#39;m a Clinical Social Worker, Certified Employee Assistance Professional, DOT Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) who interfaces with companies and employees on a daily basis regarding workplace concerns. The majority of employer-mandated referrals are due to substance use with the most prominent drug being marijuana.  These are individuals who are more often absent from work or performing their job duties sub-par as a result of being under the influence or having withdrawal symptoms.  They are slower to respond, less focused, less productive, less dependable/reliable and, depending on the setting, endangering coworkers/patients/customers.  It would be reckless for the DEA to open the flood gates and move marijuana to less restrictive Schedule 3.  <br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to begin deducting normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry enormously profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  With this, we can expect marijuana sales to grow exponentially, and harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us all too well the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco&rsquo;s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (i.e., marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. <br/><br/>Perhaps most alarming: even without the expected deluge of ads and slick marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. <br/><br/>The recommendation from HHS failed to take into account actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive; In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted to it. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, &ldquo;using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.&rdquo; <br/><br/>With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30 percent of cases of schizophrenia among 21&ndash;30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. <br/><br/>Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, &ldquo;adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.&rdquo;  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, &ldquo;Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.&rdquo; Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, &ldquo;researchers are still studying how long marijuana&rsquo;s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Finally, while some states recognize &ldquo;medical marijuana&rdquo; there is, in fact, no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that &ldquo;encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Please follow the science and public health evidence on this issue and keep marijuana in Schedule I.",

I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization.

Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity.

Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world.

    "text": "As an American citizen, I am concerned with the Drug Enforcement Administration&rsquo;s proposal to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug. Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.<br/><br/>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. <br/><br/>The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use. <br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana is unscientific and harmful. I ask that you recognize the downfalls of this type of policy and keep marijuana as a Schedule I drug.",

After I turned to using cannabis and psilocybin, I was able to titrate myself off the legal opioids and completely break my addiction. I have never gone back to using those opioid drugs - ever! Currently, I use cannabis edibles legally in California to control my chronic pain and insomnia related to two autoimmune diseases and several spinal injuries (from gymnastics) that I suffer from on a daily basis.

This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco&rsquo;s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. <br/><br/>HHS&#39; recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, &ldquo;using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.&rdquo; <br/><br/>With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21&ndash;30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. <br/><br/>Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, &ldquo;adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.&rdquo;  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, &ldquo;Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.&rdquo; Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, &ldquo;researchers are still studying how long marijuana&rsquo;s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Finally, while some states recognize &ldquo;medical marijuana&rdquo; there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that &ldquo;encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.&rdquo; <br/><br/>I encourage you to follow the science and public health evidence on this issue and keep marijuana in Schedule I.",

The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) funding has done much to end child hunger in many areas.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>HOWEVER&hellip;the stipulations for reimbursement include the requirement that children be in a congregate setting.

Other challenges could be transportation for the family, immigration status, kinship care situations, just to name a few. There are dozens of reasons that a child may not be able to attend a congregate meal setting to avail of that free meal. Does that mean they should experience hunger? NO!

We reside just under two miles from the Indian River, directly across from Kennedy and the SFS.   Rocket launches and the &quot;local&quot; effects - primarily noise, and occasionally road closures and traffic, are routine.   Part of why we live here is because we enjoy the occasions to be involved in activity around these programs.   Even with the increasing cadence of mostly Falcon 9 launches over the past several years, I&#39;d say these elements are at the moment still acceptable.<br/><br/>However, with SpaceX&#39;s desire to begin launches and landings of the *much larger* Starship here, I&#39;m at best unconvinced in a fundamental sense, the quality of life Brevard county residents enjoy today can reasonably be maintained, including being able to consistently get a good night&#39;s sleep.   Further, the balance between wildlife in the MINWR and launch operations is arguably tenuous.  The Indian River&#39;s pollution is still a major problem.   At FWC&#39;s request, I&#39;ve personally towed the carcass of a dead manatee towards its final resting place, starved because of this pollution.   Will Starship make it worse?   Prove to me it won&#39;t.<br/><br/>Certainly there&#39;s a line - though different for every person, where the noise and other unwanted effects of rocket operations become unacceptable.   There are also still many unknowns around the Starship, even with just four test launches so far - in particular the retrieval operations, and noise associated with those.   The sonic booms from Falcon landings already at best - can&#39;t be ignored.   One now and then is novel and fun, but up to 44 a year from Starship landings (those that return to land)?  Too much.<br/><br/>I urge the FAA to proceed extremely carefully around the environmental impact analysis in the short and long terms.  I would go so far to say that it&#39;d be completely acceptable to deny Starship operations for the sake of commitments made around the MINWR and the wildlife there, as well as the quality of life for Brevard county residents who already call this place home.",

Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.<br/><br/>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. <br/><br/>The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use. <br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana is unscientific and harmful.

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

Socially, cannabis legalization has been linked to a decrease in alcohol consumption and binge drinking among young adults, as highlighted in a study published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence.

Beyond its medical implications, removing cannabis from the CSA and rescheduling it could provide a substantial boost to small businesses and the legal cannabis workforce.

For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

    "text": "Medical and social statistics provide compelling evidence for the reclassification of cannabis under Category 3. <br/><br/>A study published in the journal Health Economics revealed that states with medical cannabis laws experienced a 6.38% reduction in opioid prescribing rates compared to states without such legislation, suggesting a potential role for cannabis in addressing opioid overprescribing and addiction. Additionally, research from the University of Kentucky found that medical cannabis legalization is associated with a 29% decrease in opioid overdose deaths, indicating a promising harm reduction strategy. Socially, cannabis legalization has been correlated with a decrease in alcohol-related traffic fatalities, with states enacting medical cannabis laws witnessing a 13% reduction, according to a study published in the journal BMC Public Health. By rescheduling cannabis to a less restrictive category, policymakers can capitalize on its therapeutic potential in mitigating the opioid crisis and reducing alcohol-related harms, ultimately promoting public health and safety.",

He will never be the same, a loss to himself, his family, and his community.<br/><br/>I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. <br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco&rsquo;s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. <br/><br/>HHS&#39; recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, &ldquo;using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.&rdquo; <br/><br/>With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21&ndash;30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. <br/><br/>Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, &ldquo;adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.&rdquo;  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, &ldquo;Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.&rdquo; Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, &ldquo;researchers are still studying how long marijuana&rsquo;s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Finally, while some states recognize &ldquo;medical marijuana&rdquo; there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that &ldquo;encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.&rdquo; <br/><br/>I encourage you to follow the science and public health evidence on this issue and keep marijuana in Schedule I.",

    "text": "To the US DOJ <br/>Drafted Thursday 6/13/2024 <br/><br/>Id like to comment in favor of the process of rescheduling marijuana from a class 1 substance, to a class 3 substance of the US CSA. I see this as a long overdue path of reform action that is largely supported by the American public by nearly 80% from reports I am reading. <br/><br/>I am also reading that nearly 85% of the American public agrees that in some form or another marijuana rescheduling does not go far enough in the advancement of the wants of said public. I request that if not through congresses abilities (through various bills that have been introduced; &amp; ultimately shot down) that the DOJ consider &amp; move toward full descheduling off of the US CSA. <br/><br/>Descheduling would allow for many forthcoming legal grey areas to be alleviated, once &amp; if rescheduling to class 3 is instituted, amongst the conflicted lawful levels of both states rights, &amp; federal laws &amp; mandates. Legal clarification gaps at these levels would be easier to initiate oversight for, &amp; shaping the regulated industry from the federal level (oversight) down has a much greater capacity then what will play out if only rescheduled to a Class 3 on the CSA&#39;s 1-5 scale. <br/><br/>I am seeing the traction that&#39;s been gained nationwide, Marijuana belongs for certain a class 3, if not a class 4 or 5 even. HHS &amp; the public have made this known now, many physicians nationwide as well, as well as the DEA&#39;s decision upon its review, the current administration, &amp; finally many current active members of congress. Former law enforcement officials as well hold this stance, as well as many current states governor&#39;s.   <br/><br/>As a former marijuana user for pain relief, &amp; for chronic lower back pain for a surgically repaired knee, &amp; sleeping aid. I hold faith that this momentum, &amp; will of nearly 85% of the American public, &amp; the above forementioned elements, &amp; bureaucracies &amp; departments of our nations governments will sort this pending issue out. I call for complete Descheduling, &amp; or support Level 3 classification, or even Class 4 or 5. There is a high medical value, in many forms, &amp; I think you folks know this at your agencies core. Through the vast reach of scientific, &amp; medical resources at your disposal. <br/><br/>As an active employee of the energy sector, I am unable to use cannabis due to randomized drug testing at the company that employs me. I wish to have my freedoms off the clock as a free willed American mature adult. The pain I just ignore from my active life of (snowboarding, tennis, &amp; hiking all at advanced levels), is getting harder to do as I get older with the increased pain. I refuse to get a pain pill prescription, as we all know this nation has major problem of great proportions to individuals getting gripped by the dark power of these types of drugs. I ask that heavy consideration to a more active &amp; accurate form of drug testing be adapted upon rescheduling to call 3 be agreed upon for safety sensitive positions such as mine in a natural gas control room. Urine testing is far outdated, &amp; does a extremely poor job of identifying active impairment. Saiva based testing is proper way to ensure folks in safety sensitive roles have been using drugs within 2 days of reporting to work. The comprehensive scientific gaps in urine testing is horrible, &amp; folks can use much harder illicit drugs &amp; test negative via urine testing. I have sat by for year hearing many coworkers week in, &amp; week out speak of going home &amp; using alcohol to concerning levels, &amp; certainly known of folks most likely coming in &quot;hung Over&quot; &amp; impaired while at these energy industry jobs. The hypocrisy is abundant. I believe the momentum here on the rescheduling (or descheduling) is the proper time to address my stance, &amp; concerns about clarity around revised rules for randomized drug testing in safety sensitive roles. I fear for pain increasing with limited ability to deal with it outside of heavy pharmaceutical prescriptions, countered that against if I cant (snowboard/play tennis/ &amp; hike) due to intense knee pain; my mental health, &amp; physical health will start to come into play for the worse. <br/><br/>I am a mature adult, I would never use cannabis before work, or during work, but I do wish to use edibles, &amp; tinctures of cannabis without fear of losing my job &amp; career reputation. My desire for light use at the start of weekends, &amp; start of vacations is completely harmless to my ability to working in a Gas Control Room.<br/><br/>-Thank you for your departments consideration on behalf of my concerns.<br/>-Best Regards,  ",

    "text": "The rationale for rescheduling cannabis to Schedule 3 is substantiated by empirical medical evidence and tangible economic advantages. Research published in Health Affairs has shown that states with medical cannabis laws witness a significant reduction in opioid prescriptions, indicating the potential of cannabis as a therapeutic alternative for pain management. Moreover, studies from institutions such as the University of California, San Diego, have found that access to medical cannabis is associated with lower rates of opioid-related hospitalizations, suggesting a potential avenue for addressing the opioid crisis. In tandem with these medical benefits, the elimination of Section 280E from the tax code would offer substantial relief to small businesses and the vast number of legal cannabis workers in the United States. Section 280E currently imposes burdensome tax obligations on cannabis businesses by disallowing deductions for ordinary business expenses, stifling growth and innovation within the industry. By removing this barrier, policymakers can foster a more equitable economic landscape, promote job creation, and support the livelihoods of countless individuals employed in the legal cannabis sector.",

Moreover, studies from the National Institute on Drug Abuse suggest that cannabis legalization is associated with reduced rates of opioid prescribing, offering a potential solution to the opioid crisis. In addition to its medical implications, removing cannabis from the CSA and rescheduling it could provide significant benefits for small businesses and the legal cannabis workforce. The current federal prohibition on cannabis poses challenges such as limited access to banking services and barriers to interstate commerce, hindering the growth and development of the industry. By reclassifying cannabis and lifting federal restrictions, small businesses can thrive, creating jobs and driving economic growth. Furthermore, removing cannabis from the CSA would facilitate increased research opportunities, leading to advancements in medical treatments and therapies. In summary, rescheduling cannabis and removing it from the CSA is supported by empirical data and holds great promise for public health, the economy, and the livelihoods of legal cannabis workers.",

While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers.

Those medical issues have, over the course of time, developed into complications including sciatica affecting both left and right legs; and neuropathy in both left and right hands/arms. Initially, I kept pain levels down to moderate levels with OTC pain relievers. I did keep the pain to tolerable levels for several years, until those no longer provided acceptable relief. In 2012, doctors referred me to a pain management clinic and after additional x-rays, MRI&rsquo;s and doctor visits, the recommendation was to submit to shots (undergo sedation and nerve blockers every 4 to 6 weeks) and take opioid prescriptions. I am aware that opioids and the shots recommended by the doctors will do nothing but mask the pain and will do nothing to correct my medical issues. This along with the fact that once an opioid prescription is begun I would have to take them for the rest of my life.  Being sedated to receive one or more injections every 4 to 6 weeks and a lifetime of prescription opioid use is not an acceptable remedy for me at this time. <br/><br/>After the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, I did begin using CBD products, which did manage to ameliorate the pain to an acceptable level for some time. After trying several forms at CBD, I found that Full Spectrum (with legal levels of THC) was the only type of CBD that kept my pain levels down to enable me to function without major concerns. However, as is typical, my pain levels continued to worsen over time. In 2022 I applied for a Texas Compassionate Use recommendation. I have been using approved Cannabis Oil since being approved. This has been the only thing that consistently keeps pain levels to a threshold where I can reasonably function. It is the addition of THC to the CBD that has enabled me manage my pain. I understand that, at some point, I may have to take the recommended course of shots and opioids but I want to put that off as long as possible.<br/><br/>The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis &ldquo;has a currently accepted medical use&rdquo; and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.<br/><br/>HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.<br/><br/>Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients.

Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity.

    "text": "I am writing to express my strong support for the Department of Justice&#39;s proposal to transfer marijuana from schedule I to schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This proposed change is a significant and much-needed step forward in aligning federal policy with contemporary scientific understanding and societal needs.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the reclassification of marijuana to schedule III acknowledges its accepted medical use, as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This move reflects the growing body of scientific evidence supporting the therapeutic benefits of marijuana for a range of medical conditions, including chronic pain, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, among others. By recognizing marijuana&#39;s medical utility, the proposed reclassification will facilitate greater research opportunities and enable healthcare providers to offer more comprehensive care to patients in need.<br/><br/>Furthermore, moving marijuana to schedule III will help reduce the barriers faced by researchers and medical professionals. Currently, the schedule I classification imposes onerous restrictions on research, limiting our ability to fully understand and harness the potential benefits of marijuana. The proposed change will promote more robust scientific inquiry and contribute to the development of evidence-based medical treatments.<br/><br/>Additionally, this reclassification will help to address the disproportionate impact that marijuana prohibition has had on marginalized communities. While the proposal maintains necessary regulatory controls to prevent abuse and ensure public safety, it represents a step toward a more balanced and equitable approach to marijuana regulation. By shifting marijuana to schedule III, we can begin to mitigate the long-standing social and legal injustices associated with its prohibition.<br/><br/>The proposed transfer also aligns with evolving public attitudes toward marijuana. As more states legalize marijuana for medical and recreational use, it is crucial that federal policy evolves to reflect these changes. The proposed reclassification will harmonize federal regulations with state laws, providing clearer guidance for individuals and businesses operating within the legal marijuana industry.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I strongly support the Department of Justice&#39;s proposal to transfer marijuana to schedule III of the CSA. This change is a critical step toward a more rational, science-based approach to marijuana regulation that acknowledges its medical value, promotes research, and addresses historical injustices. I urge the DOJ to finalize this reclassification and continue to work toward comprehensive and equitable marijuana policy reform.",

    "text": "The argument for rescheduling cannabis to Schedule 3 and removing it from the CSA is bolstered by compelling statistical evidence, underscoring the potential benefits for medical research and the economy. According to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, states with legalized medical cannabis have experienced a significant decrease in opioid overdose deaths, with rates declining by 25% compared to non-legalized states. Furthermore, studies from the National Institute on Drug Abuse suggest that cannabis legalization is associated with lower rates of opioid prescribing, offering a promising avenue for addressing the opioid epidemic. In addition to its medical implications, removing cannabis from the CSA and rescheduling it could provide substantial advantages for small businesses and the legal cannabis workforce. The current federal prohibition on cannabis creates barriers such as restricted access to banking services and limitations on interstate commerce, impeding the growth and competitiveness of the industry. By reclassifying cannabis and eliminating federal barriers, small businesses can thrive, creating jobs and driving economic prosperity. Moreover, removing cannabis from the CSA would enable expanded research opportunities, leading to advancements in medical treatments and therapies. In conclusion, rescheduling cannabis and removing it from the CSA is supported by empirical data and offers significant potential for improving public health, boosting the economy, and supporting the well-being of legal cannabis workers.",

    "text": "&ldquo;Twelve Democratic senators signed Letter 3.  Five of the senators (Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, Kristen Gillibrand, and Ron Wyden) wrote to the Attorney General, President Joe Biden, and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in July 2022, urging cannabis descheduling and pardons for those convicted of non-violent cannabis-related offenses.  Letter to President Joseph Biden, et al. from Senator Elizabeth Warren, et al.  The senators &ldquo;write to urge&rdquo; DEA to &ldquo;swiftly deschedule marijuana&rdquo; and, while rescheduling to schedule III &ldquo;would mark a significant step forward, it would not resolve the worst harms of the current system&rdquo; for marijuana as a controlled substance, which &ldquo;has had a devastating impact on our communities and is increasingly out of step with state law and public opinion.&rdquo;  Letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Administrator Anne Milgram, from Elizabeth Warren, et al.  They note that, descheduled, marijuana could still be subject to public health regulations.<br/>1. Marijuana as a schedule I substance is in the same schedule as heroin and in a more dangerous schedule than fentanyl or cocaine, even though it is consistently found to be less dangerous than those substances, and less dangerous than alcohol.<br/>2. HHS&rsquo; recommendation noted that marijuana &ldquo;does not produce serious outcomes compared to drugs in Schedules I or II&rdquo; and &ldquo;the vast majority of individuals who use marijuana are doing so in a manner that does not lead to dangerous outcomes to themselves or others.&rdquo;<br/>3. To support its 2016 rescheduling denials, DEA pointed to lack of scientific evidence supporting medical use of marijuana, which created a catch-22 because, as a schedule I substance, marijuana is subject to DEA&rsquo;s arduous research approval process and restrictions on federal research funding, stymieing researchers&rsquo; ability to rigorously study its medical uses.<br/>4. Today, experts generally agree that marijuana has currently accepted medical uses for several indications, including managing pain, spasms, and nausea in patients undergoing chemotherapy and stimulating appetite in patients with weight loss from AIDS.<br/>5. Studies have found that marijuana access has public health benefits by reducing the rates of opioid use and opioid deaths.<br/>6. Thousands of doctors in the 38 states that permit the medical use of cannabis recommend marijuana to their patients and millions of patients consume medical marijuana under healthcare professionals&rsquo; guidance each year.<br/>7. The relevant international treaties respect the legal frameworks of signatories and allow for sufficient flexibility for states parties to design and implement national drug policies in light of their priorities and needs.<br/>8. HHS&rsquo; recommendation analysis could support descheduling, particularly as marijuana has less adverse outcomes, including less potential for an overdose, and less abuse potential than non-scheduled substances like alcohol or those scheduled lower than schedule III like benzodiazepines.<br/>9. Many criminal penalties for marijuana will continue as long as marijuana remains federally controlled because those penalties are based on the quantity of marijuana involved, not the drug&rsquo;s schedule status.<br/>10. Without descheduling marijuana, &ldquo;criminal penalties (including prison sentences, fines, and asset forfeiture) for recreational marijuana use, and for medical use of marijuana products that lack federal approval, would still exist, disproportionately penalizing Black and Brown communities.&rdquo;",

Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.<br/><br/>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC.

An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients&rsquo; access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. <br/><br/>Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to &ldquo;move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, &ldquo;The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,&rdquo; such as benzodiazepines &mdash; a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, &ldquo;No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether &ndash; thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states &ndash; I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS&rsquo; recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower.

    "text": "Marijuana potency has increased<br/>significantly and rapidly. Marijuana in<br/>the 1970s had an average of 2% THC<br/>(the psychoactive component in marijuana), but<br/>today average potency ranges from 18-35% and<br/>products as high as 99% are produced and sold by<br/>the industry.<br/>High potency products are more addictive and<br/>result in worse health outcomes for users,<br/>especially teens and young adults.<br/><br/>Marijuana is not good for mental health.  Marijuana can cause psychosis,<br/>schizophrenia, anxiety, and<br/>depression. It is linked closely<br/>with suicide, and is a major risk factor for<br/>mental illness. (DiForti et al., 2019, Hjorth&oslash;j et al., 2021,<br/>Henquet et al., 2005; Marconi et al., 2016; Mustonen et al.,<br/>2018; Niemi-Pyntt&auml;ri et al., 2013)<br/><br/>I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. <br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco&rsquo;s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. <br/><br/>HHS&#39; recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, &ldquo;using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.&rdquo; <br/><br/>With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21&ndash;30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. <br/><br/>Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, &ldquo;adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.&rdquo;  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, &ldquo;Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.&rdquo; Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, &ldquo;researchers are still studying how long marijuana&rsquo;s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Finally, while some states recognize &ldquo;medical marijuana&rdquo; there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that &ldquo;encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.&rdquo; <br/><br/>I encourage you to follow the science and public health evidence on this issue and keep marijuana in Schedule I.",

People getting shot or serving jail time just for buying a plant. And the exact same thing goes for other substances like psychedelic mushrooms, LSD, MDMA, DMT, and other very safe substances that should be able to be made legally and regulated for absolute safety. Yes it is very possible to take them and have bad experiences, but that goes for lots of legal substances too. Lots of prescription drugs carry awful negative side effects that could be avoided with the correct use of marijuana. I mean for fucks sake DMT lasts around 15 minutes and as long as it isn&rsquo;t sold to some dumb kids who don&rsquo;t know if they are mentally ok to take it, it&rsquo;s fine. As I type this the FDA is investigating Diamond Shruumz for putting who knows what in their &ldquo;psychedelic&rdquo; chocolate bars. People bought them because they are legal, and as a result had seizures and other insanely negative side effects and were hospitalized. If psychedelic mushrooms were legal, and companies weren&rsquo;t forced into trying to replicate already existing things that are safe and yet somehow illegal, those chocolate bars could have real mushrooms in them and nobody would have been hospitalized as a result of the substance. I hope society in the future looks back at the past and looks down on us for the amount of lives that were ruined by the banning and criminalization of these substances that should be any one persons own decision to choose to try.",

If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone&rsquo;s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. <br/><br/>The criminalization of cannabis&mdash;a legacy of the War on Drugs&mdash;was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It&rsquo;s time to abandon this draconian approach.

    "text": "Ensuring safe accommodations for air travelers with disabilities using wheelchairs is urgently needed.  As a wheelchair user who has had my chairs damaged multiple times on flights, I know that better training requirements are needed to stop this damage.  Airline personnel and contract employees obviously have have little training, as evidenced by the lack of knowledge about how to handle wheelchairs (and the numerous chairs that get damaged each month).  I have also experienced rough handling of my body by personnel when I am transferring to an airline seat.  These transfers often are not safe or dignified.  They are typically very rushed and I am not asked how I would like to be transferred, and usually not told when they are about to move me.  Simply asking for my input about what works best for me, and communicating when and what is being done would go a long way toward showing respect and reducing physical injuries to people with disabilities.  I often experience unnecessarily long delays while deplaning (this took an hour on my last flight).  My wheelchair ended up in baggage claim!  Wheelchairs need to be brought to passengers promptly.  If chairs are damaged, repair or replacement must happen as quickly as possible, in order to maintain our health and independent functioning. Airlines need to train personnel about stowage process (what size chairs will fit so that there are no surprises right before the flight, as I was told the night before that my chair was too big for the aircraft).  Staff must be trained to handle our chairs with care, as they are akin to our legs.  When they are damaged, this disrupts our lives severely and has negative impacts on health, work/school, family, and social life. It will be a big improvement when we can take our chairs on board and have them secured vs stowed where the risk of damage is increased.  Another important change urgently needed is for accessible lavatories to be available.  Not having these is essentially denying people with disabilities access to a basic human need.  Non-disabled passengers would not tolerate flying without having lavatories available for use.  This is a matter of respect and dignity.  As a service dog handler, I would also appreciate the streamlining of paperwork that is submitted to the airline and to DOT.  This puts a burden on people with service dogs.  I do not think this is needed for every single flight.",

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

Dist. to express our strong opposition to the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration&rsquo;s (OSHA) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Emergency Response Standard.  The Papineau Fire Protection District is a unit of local government located in Papineau, Illinois. Our District is a volunteer fire service organization that is funded by an annual budget of $50,000 and consists of 18 members.  Our source of operating funding comes from real estate property taxes.<br/><br/>Firefighter safety is always a concern and priority to our organization, however the proposed regulations drafted by OSHA will create a significantly greater burden on our District than the existing regulation in effect through the Illinois Department of Labor (IL OSHA) under the Illinois &ldquo;State Plan&rdquo; that automatically will inhibit our ability to carry out fire protection and emergency service functions. If the proposed regulation is implemented, I do not believe it will effectively accomplish the goals in which OSHA is wishing to achieve. I ask that you consider these points:<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Federal OSHA costs estimates are not realistic.<br/>OSHA estimates the average cost of compliance to be between $14,397.00 - $15,389.00, however&hellip;The OSHA cost estimations do not take into account the nonmonetary burden that will occur with these compliance requirements. In many organizations like ours, reporting and recordkeeping is performed on an unpaid or minimally paid basis. This burden will &ldquo;burn out&rdquo; the fire officers who do this work currently. We expect that many will leave the fire and emergency services. This will likely impair fire protection and emergency services in communities like ours.<br/><br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>There is no proposal for funding the new compliance requirements.<br/><br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>There must be compliance flexibility built into the regulation to take into account the administrative, recordkeeping, and other compliance related burdens and expenses to smaller fire service and emergency service organizations like ours. Adopting national standards, while commendable from a firefighter safety perspective, does not allow adequate flexibility and the result will be that many people who are now in leadership positions will depart along with<br/><br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Federal OSHA&rsquo;s assumption that most volunteer firefighters and emergency responders will not be covered by new rules is incorrect as to departments like those in Illinois which are operating under a &ldquo;State Plan.&rdquo; <br/>Although the proposed regulation indicates that volunteer district would not be applicable, twenty two states, including Illinois, are under a State Plan jurisdiction. When under a &ldquo;State Plan&rdquo; Federal OSHA regulations automatically apply. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In conclusion, Papineau Fire Prot. Dist. strongly opposes the proposed rule on Emergency Response. The rule, although well intended, has failed to fully and correctly consider the impact on fire and emergency service organizations. For the foregoing reasons, we request that this rule not be finalized as it currently stands.  <br/><br/>Sincerely, Chief Jed Beaupre<br/>Jbeaupre.chief@gmail.com<br/>",

CFIs are incapable of exploring the true details of an asylum seeker&#39;s situation -- including whether or not an asylum seeker is subject to any of the asylum bars -- because they are intended to be fast, simple, and streamlined. The asylum bars are nuanced, complicated, and best explored with an immigration attorney. CFIs are almost always conducted without counsel present to help asylum seekers navigate the questions. This rule is therefore certain to prematurely and unjustly deny noncitizens with valid claims from pursuing asylum in the United States. It is certain to violate the U.S.&#39;s international obligations and result in the suffering and death of men, women, and children who come to the U.S. for protection, as is their right. There is no need to &quot;improve&quot; the efficacy and efficiency of the U.S. asylum system by unfairly erecting barriers to success during this initial screening procedure. Instead, DHS should hire more AOs and IJs and fund pro bono immigration representation for asylum seekers who cannot afford it. This would serve U.S. interests in adjudicating asylum claims more expeditiously and fairly while avoiding the dire and inhumane consequences that would surely result from this rule. ",

Private Equity firms&#39; access to capital unfairly positions them to pay more and offer cash whereas  the individual buyer must use conventional financing putting that homebuyer in an unfavorable position compared to PE firms. In some states PE firms own as much as 25% of all single family homes and are working to buy up more. This creates a major problem for people needing to purchase a home by unfair competition and lack of future inventory because these firms are holding onto them as investments. Lack of inventory and higher prices due to PE firms purchasing single family homes has created a crisis. PE firms are also driving to rents in markets where they own significant inventory. <br/>Besides their pursuit of single family homes, PE firms are seeking to buy up primary care and specialty healthcare practices, pharmacies, and ancillary practices such as physical therapy, radiology, small hospitals, and cancer treatment. They are forcing physicians they employ to make decisions based on clinical guidelines implemented to maximize profit rather than best patient care outcomes.  After the housing market crash in 2008 these firms outlined a plan to purchase businesses that were considered resistant to economic downturn because consumers still put their discretionary dollars there. They saw that people still spent money on their Chand pets so the PE firms started buying up childcare centers and vet clinics. PE firms own the majority of national and regional childcare centers and have made a huge investment in buying veterinary practices and are approaching monopolistic levels in both sectors which obviously harms consumers due to lack of choice.<br/><br/>Private equity&#39;s acquisition of companies tends to consistently result in those firms selling off real estate holdings and other tangible assets, and putting companies in unfavorable leases with unsustainable costs which drive these companies into premeditated bankruptcy. The PE firms purposely strip ALL VALUE from the firms they acquire and then leverage the bankruptcy system to their favor to get the company off their books. They go into the purchases with malice and aforethought, with no regard to the people they harm and lost jobs that are collateral damage. The PE firms suffer no penalty while they reap enormous profits leaving destruction in their wake. Rather than being held accountable, they are rewarded. <br/>",

One of the reasons that I work at an organization like HIAS PA is because of my belief that those fleeing persecution should have a fair opportunity to seek asylum in the United States.  I write to urge the Department of Homeland Security not to move forward with issuing the proposed rule entitled &ldquo;Application of Certain Mandatory Bars in Fear Screenings.&rdquo; <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Application of the mandatory bars to asylum during the credible fear and reasonable fear interview process is deeply problematic.  First, it is extremely difficult for asylum seekers to obtain counsel to represent them in a fear screening interview.  Most of these interviews occur within hours or days of an asylum seeker reaching the United States.  Typically the asylum seeker is detained at the time of their interview, and without means to contact an attorney or others who could assist them.  The financial and logistical barriers for asylum seekers to obtain counsel in this context are immense.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Without an attorney it is difficult for an asylum seeker to challenge an asylum officer&rsquo;s contention that a mandatory bar may apply.  Oftentimes, evidence that would demonstrate that a bar does not in fact apply is virtually impossible to obtain and present without an attorney.  Moreover, an asylum seeker on their own will be unable to meaningfully contest an officer&rsquo;s claim that a mandatory bar applies, as such determinations are often based on decades of complex case law discussing, for example, what constitutes a particularly serious crime or when the persecutor bar applies.<br/><br/>Additionally, an asylum seeker&rsquo;s testimony concerning a foreign criminal matter may at first pass during a screening interview appear to trigger the application of a mandatory bar.  Yet after a full Immigration Court hearing, many asylum seekers&rsquo; foreign convictions are ultimately discovered to be the result of a political prosecution or government corruption, which do not conform to U.S. due process norms.  In fact, many foreign convictions are uncovered to be a component of the persecution that the asylum seeker experienced in their home country for having voiced dissent against an authoritarian government.  Applying the mandatory bars at the criminal stage deprives asylum seekers of a full hearing with an opportunity to present witnesses and evidence that would allow a court to determine the true nature of the conviction.  <br/><br/>Promulgating this rule will cut against the work of HIAS PA and many of our partner organizations.    Most importantly, the rule will undoubtedly lead to the deportation of asylum seekers to countries in which they will be persecuted and tortured.  Now is the time to reaffirm the right to seek asylum, not restrict it.  <br/>",

Lawmakers recognized that asylum is an incredibly complex area of law that can be difficult even for seasoned attorneys to navigate. That is why credible fear screenings were designed as the first step in a more robust legal process, with the potential applicability of statutory bars (a particularly complex legal question) to be evaluated later.<br/><br/>People arrive at the border exhausted and often traumatized. Very few are able to access critical legal help, and this inequity has been compounded by the Biden administration&#39;s truncation of the process.

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

    "text": "Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

Marijuana is a safer way to relax for people who need the stress relief and the endocannibinoid system is the key to curing cancer. Opening the endocannibinoid system to research with marijuana, may end cancer. Furthermore, I have a genetic condition that causes cancer in the endocrine system. Personally. And I&rsquo;ve used marijuana since I was 18 years old regularly, in an effort to curb that cancer from getting me. It seems to have worked: everyone in my dad&rsquo;s side of the family who have the genetic issue have had cancer, in one form or another. Except me. I don&rsquo;t find that to be a coincidence, especially given that those family members did not use cannabis regularly.",

This is not merely conjecture, as news stories break daily of departments closing their doors as a result of unsurmountable challenges they face.  Sure, we may see some form of alternative coverage arrangement when a department fails, but all too often it is a neighboring department who &quot;takes over&quot; but now has an emergency response time of 30-40 minutes instead of the previous department&#39;s 5-10 minute response capability.  You can say the coverage is still there, but is it really reasonable or even adequate?<br/>While the provisions of the revised OSHA rules might provide hope for a safer work environment, these advancements will definitely come at the cost of maintaining our levels of service if there is not some type of remuneration to help absorb the additional expenses that will undoubtedly be incurred.   My  department estimates the rules as written, will cost several thousand dollars per employee, per year.  It has been a known fact, acknowledged by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), that EMS providers have been reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and a host of other payors below the cost of providing their services for over three decades.  At some point, there has to be a realization that if gains achieved by the new OSHA rules come at the expense of collateral damage in the form of department closings, or at best extended response times and retro-grade movement in the levels of care to be provided, the result may very well be a net-sum negative.<br/>I challenge those responsible for changes to the OSHA rules to consider the necessary funding needed to implement these changes.

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

    "text": "Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

Given the ubiquity of sodium in the food supply, consumers are limited in what they can do to protect themselves.

While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA.

    "text": "I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362).<br/><br/>The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis &ldquo;has a currently accepted medical use&rdquo; and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.<br/><br/>HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.<br/><br/>Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients&rsquo; access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. <br/><br/>Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to &ldquo;move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, &ldquo;The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,&rdquo; such as benzodiazepines &mdash; a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled.

    "text": "Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

Marijuana is a safer way to relax for people who need the stress relief and the endocannibinoid system is the key to curing cancer. Opening the endocannibinoid system to research with marijuana, may end cancer. Furthermore, I have a genetic condition that causes cancer in the endocrine system. Personally. And I&rsquo;ve used marijuana since I was 18 years old regularly, in an effort to curb that cancer from getting me. It seems to have worked: everyone in my dad&rsquo;s side of the family who have the genetic issue have had cancer, in one form or another. Except me. I don&rsquo;t find that to be a coincidence, especially given that those family members did not use cannabis regularly.",

This is not merely conjecture, as news stories break daily of departments closing their doors as a result of unsurmountable challenges they face.  Sure, we may see some form of alternative coverage arrangement when a department fails, but all too often it is a neighboring department who &quot;takes over&quot; but now has an emergency response time of 30-40 minutes instead of the previous department&#39;s 5-10 minute response capability.  You can say the coverage is still there, but is it really reasonable or even adequate?<br/>While the provisions of the revised OSHA rules might provide hope for a safer work environment, these advancements will definitely come at the cost of maintaining our levels of service if there is not some type of remuneration to help absorb the additional expenses that will undoubtedly be incurred.   My  department estimates the rules as written, will cost several thousand dollars per employee, per year.  It has been a known fact, acknowledged by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), that EMS providers have been reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and a host of other payors below the cost of providing their services for over three decades.  At some point, there has to be a realization that if gains achieved by the new OSHA rules come at the expense of collateral damage in the form of department closings, or at best extended response times and retro-grade movement in the levels of care to be provided, the result may very well be a net-sum negative.<br/>I challenge those responsible for changes to the OSHA rules to consider the necessary funding needed to implement these changes.

It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

Given the ubiquity of sodium in the food supply, consumers are limited in what they can do to protect themselves. But government-established voluntary targets can prompt industry to reformulate its products, reducing the toll of high blood pressure and heart disease. <br/><br/>FDA took steps towards addressing this crisis in 2016 when it issued a draft guidance with both short- (2-year) and long-term (10-year) targets. The short-term targets have been finalized, but not the longer-term ones. Only FDA has the ability to encourage industry to act, and we urge it to do so by setting these targets as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Edward Shortsleeve<br/>NY",

    "text": "Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences.

    "text": "Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

    "text": "I fully support the proposed 2025 CMS Age-Friendly Hospital Measure. The implementation of the 4Ms&mdash;What Matters, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility&mdash;is critical in delivering care that aligns with the values and needs of older adults. A recent hospitalization experience with a family member living with dementia underscored the necessity of this approach. During their stay, inappropriate medication management led to significant mental status changes, highlighting a gap in current care practices.<br/><br/>Moreover, the hospital staff demonstrated a need for better training and awareness in managing cognitive changes. Understanding dementia and knowing how to support individuals effectively&mdash;without relying on unnecessary medications or restraints&mdash;is crucial. The 4Ms framework addresses these issues directly, ensuring that care is not only safe but also person-centered.<br/><br/>By adopting this measure, we can significantly improve the quality of care for older adults, especially those who may struggle to communicate their needs and preferences. This proposal is a vital step towards creating a healthcare environment that respects and responds to the unique challenges faced by this vulnerable population.",

Many of my patients would benefit from this combination in order to avoid the risk (and cost) of two separate procedures when clinically appropriate. Currently, the cost of the combined procedure is not adequately reimbursed by MS-DRG 273/274, and my hospital system is unable to support these cases due to the significant financial loss incurred. For the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, it would be fiscally responsible to create MS-DRG 317. Since many patients eventually require both procedures, Medicare and Medicaid would realize a cost savings by allowing physicians to combine two procedures into one. Then, the patient would only need to undergo a single transseptal puncture (one of the riskiest parts of both procedures), a single episode of anesthesia, and the duration of oral anticoagulation would be shortened.",

But I will leave it to them to determine what they think will work best for them. We may just show them what others have used in the hospitals as a wristband identification. What is more disappointing is that there is no set standard at the federal or state level for wristbands used in the hospital system.<br/> <br/>I already have all the training material and people ready to get this started.

Hospitals must comply with this requirement or face penalties through poor performance ratings, affecting their public quality measures and potential incentive payments.<br/><br/>Key Issues:<br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Violation of the Patient Safety Act: The requirement for hospitals to report patient safety events to a PSO that then reports to the NPSD violates the Patient Safety Act. The Patient Safety Act safeguards voluntary, confidential, and nonpunitive reporting to improve patient safety, not for regulatory accountability. Therefore, this proposed measure should be withdrawn.<br/><br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Impact on Innovation and Learning Systems: Requiring PSOs to report to NPSD undermines the innovative, collaborative, and nonpunitive nature of the current patient safety systems. The shift towards mandatory reporting for accountability purposes risks stifling the voluntary exchange of information, causing a breakdown in the learning system designed to improve patient safety.<br/><br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Inconsistent Standards: The lack of standardized definitions for &ldquo;serious patient safety event,&rdquo; &ldquo;precursor event,&rdquo; and &ldquo;near miss&rdquo; means that hospitals and PSOs will interpret and report these events inconsistently. This inconsistency undermines the measure&#39;s effectiveness. The absence of standard regulatory definitions for these events introduces further complexity and variability.<br/><br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Administrative Burden, Technological Challenges, and Increased Costs: The requirement to submit all serious safety events, precursor events, and near-miss events would impose an undue administrative burden on hospitals. Currently, the technology to efficiently transmit this data is lacking. This regulation would lead to increasing administrative costs and diverting resources from proactive patient safety improvements to retrospective data collection and reporting.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we urge CMS to withdraw paragraph (B) of the &ldquo;accountability and transparency&rdquo; domain from the Patient Safety Structural Measure. The proposed requirement violates the Patient Safety Act, impedes innovative approaches to improving patient care, imposes undue administrative burdens, and diverts focus from proactive safety measures. We remain committed to enhancing patient safety and welcome further discussions on developing measures that support this goal without compromising the principles established by the Patient Safety Act. Thank you for considering our feedback.<br/>",

The proposal stands to benefit millions of patients across rural America by addressing disparities in the Medicare area wage index. <br/><br/>My home state of Tennessee has experienced a stark decrease in wage index rates. This has occurred despite rising costs and increased wages. The result has been significantly reduced reimbursements when caring for patients. The cumulative effect has been that our region over time has had drastically less funding than other regions to attract and retain medical staff to serve our area&rsquo;s patients. It has also contributed to Tennessee having the second highest number of rural hospital closures in the nation. In my region alone, there have been 2 rural hospitals that have closed in the past 5 years due to these hardships: creating a health care disparity for our local communities and increasing the strain on local emergency services. CMS&rsquo; Low-Wage Hospital Policy shows strong potential for improving this detrimental situation in reducing health care availability for these rural communities and I hope you will keep the three-year continuation of the policy in the final rule. <br/><br/>The Low-Wage Hospital Policy has been a critical lifeline for rural hospitals in my home state and for rural communities everywhere.

    "text": "I am writing to express my opposition to the recommendation to move botanical marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).<br/>Rescheduling marijuana would exacerbate the public health harms caused by marijuana. Although the marijuana industry markets high THC products as medicine, there has been no research supporting the use of wax, shatter or high THC vape oil for medical purposes. This has caused both youth and adults to believe these products are safe. A study in the Journal of Pediatrics found that instances of children under the age of six accidentally ingesting marijuana has jumped 1,375% from 2017 to 2021, climbing from 200 per year to more than 3,000 per year. Marijuana users are 25% more likely to need emergency care and hospitalization. <br/>Marijuana use is very concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, &ldquo;adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school&rdquo;.  Colorado warns, &ldquo;Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana&rdquo; Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, the National Institute on Drug Abuse noted, &ldquo;researchers are still studying how long marijuana&rsquo;s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent&rdquo;.<br/>Marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011.<br/>The recommendation from HHS failed to take into account actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Marijuana can be addictive; In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, &ldquo;using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder&rdquo;. Research shows that marijuana use changes the structure of the brain and heavy, lifelong use can result in IQ loss.<br/>With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30 percent of cases of schizophrenia among 21&ndash;30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. <br/>Since botanical cannabis did not meet previous criteria for currently accepted medical use (CAMU), HHS pretextually changed the definition of CAMU Even using this broader definition, botanical cannabis fails to meet CAMU criteria. <br/>&ldquo;Widespread&rdquo; implies that the drug is broadly accepted and utilized within the medical community, but this is not the case. HHS states that 30,000 licensed health care practitioners (LHCPs) are authorized to recommend the use of marijuana, but this number represents fewer than 3% of LHCPs with prescriptive authority.<br/>As evidence of &ldquo;some scientific support for one medical use&rdquo;, HHS states that science supports botanical cannabis for &ldquo;anorexia related to a medical condition; nausea and vomiting (e.g., chemotherapy-induced); and pain&rdquo;. HHS conflates isolated cannabinoids and crude cannabis products. It does not follow that botanical cannabis &ndash; with multiple active chemicals &ndash; will have the same effect as medications with small, specified doses of a single active chemical. While dronabinol has been shown to alleviate symptoms of nausea and vomiting, botanical marijuana use can lead to intractable vomiting &ndash; Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome.<br/>Safety is a major concern as traffic fatalities, psychosis, suicide, violence, depression, mania, maternal-fetal harms, and addiction have been associated with the use of botanical marijuana.<br/>Marijuana use is also associated with cardiovascular health issues. According to the American Heart Association, marijuana use without tobacco use can increase heart disease risk by 300%  Furthermore, heart attacks are twice as likely in young adults who used marijuana.<br/>Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state.<br/>I encourage you to follow the science and public health evidence on this issue and keep marijuana in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act.",

In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.&mdash;70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll&mdash;support cannabis legalization. <br/><br/>But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health &amp; Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone&rsquo;s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. <br/><br/>The criminalization of cannabis&mdash;a legacy of the War on Drugs&mdash;was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It&rsquo;s time to abandon this draconian approach. I support descheduling cannabis from the CSA&mdash;a step toward righting the wrongs of its criminalization.",

    "text": "Delirium is often coded as acute encephalopathy which leads to confusion in the clinical environment as we are using different terms to express the observed clinical behaviors and features. Further, the full economic costs of delirium are unknown. We are worried With CMS proposing to &quot;retain the severity designation of [causally specified delirium codes] as CCs for FY 2025&quot; for the following reasons:<br/>-A diagnosis of causally specified delirium implies a diagnosis of toxic or metabolic encephalopathy (TME) [see https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-019-05907-4].<br/>Current MS-DRG designations incentivize TME over delirium across the board [see Table 4 in attached document #1 or Table 1 in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2024.02.004].<br/>-Clinicians in the US are increasingly favoring diagnoses of TME over delirium, a trend driven by the reimbursement disparity in the MS-DRG [see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2021.12.006 and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2022.02.004].<br/>-Reasons why a delirium diagnosis should be preferred over a TME diagnosis include [each of the following described in supplement #1 and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2024.02.004]:<br/>-Unlike TME, delirium has a valid, operationalized definition. Unlike TME, delirium can be diagnosed reliably based on its clinical definition. Unlike TME, delirium focuses attention on the patient&rsquo;s experience and degree of engagement in care, including distress, decisional capacity to express personal preferences and make in healthcare decisions, and behavioral disturbances that place themselves and others at risk of harm. Unlike TME, delirium has several clinical practice guidelines devoted to it [see comments under CMS guiding principle #7 in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2024.02.004]<br/><br/>Delirium is the clearly preferred term in:<br/>-Critical care [as evidenced in the PADIS guidelines: https://www.sccm.org/iculiberation/guidelines ]<br/>-Psychiatry [as in the DSM-5-TR and forthcoming APA Delirium Clinical Practice Guidelines, https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/clinical-practice-guidelines/review-draft-guidelines]<br/>-Surgery [as in the American College of Surgery&rsquo;s Geriatric Surgery Verification program, https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/accreditation-and-verification/geriatric-surgery-verification/]<br/>-Geriatrics [as in the American Geriatrics Society&rsquo;s CoCare: HELP, https://www.americangeriatrics.org/programs/ags-cocarer, and The John A.

Agreed, people need many forms of assistance. But our Covid-19 deaths are on par number-wise with our all-opioid overdose deaths. Yet no one is talking about that. Why does the same number of people dying from one reason cause concern but not a different (still preventable) reason?  Our motor vehicle deaths per year number is lower than the number of people per year who died from Covid-19.  Yet the morning and evening news give information about the car accidents when they happen and people demand fixes to infrastructure if it is that (speed limit too high, sight lines too short, etc.) or  justice in a court of law if someone was at fault (speeding, drinking and driving, etc.).   Understanding infectious diseases in our society (such as flu, RSV, and Covid) is just as crucial as figuring out the engineering of our road systems or addressing social issues that impact opioid use. .<br/><br/>With data and insight, we can change the trajectory of infectious disease. Knowing when and where hotspots are happening is a first step. Keeping people from catching infectious diseases at hospitals is important, and to do that, we have to know in the first place how many it is happening to, and then figure out why and how to reduce it. <br/><br/>So, yes...a very strong YES to tracking and reporting hospital acquired infections for flu, RSV, and Covid.

For instance, more than 100 health organizations have signed the Department of Health and Human Services Health Sector Climate Pledge. <br/><br/>While this momentum is encouraging, efforts to date are inadequate to fully address the climate crisis, and achieving health sector climate goals will require federal support and programs such as this Initiative. <br/><br/>This Initiative positions the U.S. health care sector as a global leader in addressing the climate crisis and significantly strengthens current efforts to advance climate-smart healthcare. In addition, the Initiative can yield direct public health benefits, lead to potential cost savings for health care organizations, improve patient outcomes, and set the foundation for further health sector climate leadership. <br/><br/>This Initiative has my full support and is a critical, significant step toward advancing low-emissions, climate-resilient health care across the U.S.",

Humphrey Building<br/>200 Independence Avenue, SW<br/>Washington, D.C. 20201<br/><br/>Re: Support for Continuation of the Low-Wage Hospital Policy in CMS-1808-P<br/><br/>Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure:<br/><br/>Thank you for including a three-year continuation of the Low-Wage Hospital Policy in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Fiscal Year 2025 Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System proposed rule (CMS-1808-P), dated April 10, 2024. The proposal stands to benefit millions of patients across rural America by addressing disparities in the Medicare area wage index. <br/><br/>Over a two-decade period, the majority of hospitals in my home state of Tennessee have experienced a stark decrease in wage index rates. This has occurred despite rising costs and increased wages. The result has been significantly reduced reimbursements when caring for patients. The cumulative effect has been that our region over time has had drastically less funding than other regions to attract and retain medical staff to serve our area&rsquo;s patients. It has also contributed to Tennessee having the second highest number of rural hospital closures in the nation. CMS&rsquo; Low-Wage Hospital Policy shows strong potential for improving this harmful situation, and I hope you will keep the three-year continuation of the policy in the final rule. <br/><br/>The Low-Wage Hospital Policy has been a critical lifeline for rural hospitals in my home state and elsewhere. I implore CMS to include it in the final rule. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>S. Owens",

    "text": "As a former employee of a medical marijuana distribution center, I believe the rescheduling of cannabis could benefit in an incredible way. For starters, rescheduling it would give scientists around the Country the ability to thoroughly investigate the possible medicinal benefits cannabis may have to offer. Secondly, the taxes revenue that would come from cannabis sales would greatly benefit each and every state with any projects they may be currently attempting to fund, which in turn would directly take the money out of the hands of drug dealers across America. Third, lowering the schedule would allow the FDA to get involved and make sure that any medical marijuana that makes its way to its patients could have the FDA&rsquo;s seal of approval, which would give any possible patients peace  of mind that the medicine they have is in fact safe. Lastly, a friend of mine, that I would go to far as say my brother, passed away in 2021 due to a drug dealer lacing his cannabis with Fentanyl. The chances of this happening would have been drastically reduced had we proceeded with this rescheduling sooner. That is in the past now, moving forward I feel that the federal government stepping in on cannabis and closely monitoring its production will help make a safer environment for everyone. Thank you for your time.",

We have tested both single-site and multi-site fungicides, alone throughout the summer season, during high apple bitter rot pressure.

This multi-site fungicide is a necessary alternative to manzate due to pre-harvest interval (PHI) of 77 days applicable to manzate but not to ferbam (PHI is only 7 days for Ferbam Granuflo). Growers have to switch to ferbam for early season maturing apples and to prevent various fungal problems mid and later in the season.

Ferbam is also a key component for anti-resistance management strategy for single-site fungicides that many growers currently apply 6-8 times for apple bitter rot control (specifically, strobilurins). Ferbam is an important tank-mix partner for strobilurins and other single-site fungicides effective for apple bitter rot (e.g. benzovindiflupyr and fluazinam) that broadens the specter of efficacy of the spray tank mix to avoid resistance occurrence in Colletotrichum species that cause apple bitter rot. The resistance in Colletotrichum species to single-site fungicides, including strobilurins, has been reported throughout the world.

    "text": "I travel 1-2 times per month for business to both U.S. and international destinations, along with numerous others in our area who either travel for work or telecommute. Let&#39;s be honest, a lot of us in the North Country are working professional jobs that are not limited to just our area or are even telecommuting with remote jobs but that require us to travel. Additionally, travel options are what matter the most in our region, both for the constituents who live/work/study here, and for the local economy as people consider traveling through and even moving here. In fact, we have gotten significant interest in recent years, post-pandemic, from people in big cities who want more space, more land, and larger houses with greater cost efficiency, which the North Country here in Northern New York has to offer. Travel options will maximize the success of migration to our region, continued economic vitality for those living in our region, the ability for employers to do sales-related and other business travel to the U.S. and the world (and, &quot;exporting&quot; or selling to customers outside of our area is extremely important for our economy&#39;s resilience), and the ability for our growing hospital systems to attract and retain high-quality talent, and the ability for our universities to attract and retain students and faculty (and the universities are paramount to the success of our economy). I have spoken with many business owners and professionals about what works and what frustrates them with travel. When we had a Chicago O&#39;Hare flight out of Ogdensburg International Airport, we had a fantastic mix of options: we could drive to Ogdensburg airport and connect via Chicago when we needed to travel to midwestern and western U.S. destinations or to travel internationally, we could drive to Massena to connect via Boston and access any East-coast destination and several international destinations, we could drive to Watertown and connect to Philadelphia airport for primarily East-coast and some other U.S. destinations, and we could drive to either Syracuse or Plattsburgh for the occasional travel elsewhere. This flexibilty maximized the utility of our region as a place you could live and still be connected with jobs, customers, and families. When Ogdensburg ceased Chicago O&#39;Hare flights, we lost access to the best-connected and fantastically well-navigable airport in the entire U.S., as O&#39;Hare is literally the biggest and most convenient hub that interconnects all of the U.S. with the rest of the North America and further. Many destinations became impossible to reach from the North Country without driving to Syracuse, because, by time you connect via Philadelphia (for example, from Watertown or from Ogdensburg), you have to add an entire additional travel day going out and/or coming back, which absolutely destroys all business travel and inconveniences any other travel. Who can afford to stay 1-2 (usually 2) extra days at a hotel per trip just because their travel options are severely limited by the loss of the North Country&#39;s O&#39;Hare connection? In fact, many frequent travellers I know, including myself, have driven to Syracuse or even Scranton or JFK in order to catch flights to O&#39;Hare at reasonable timeframes, often departing the North Country as early as 1am in the morning to make the commute to the nearest viable airport. I&#39;ve spoken with numerous U.S. and international students and faculty about their journeys, and many of them, when coming to our area for the universities, fly into places like Syracuse or JFK and take a 12-to-16 hour bus ride to Canton and Potsdam because there isn&#39;t a better option, despite the North Country having 5 or more international airports, and reconnecting O&#39;Hare via Ogdensburg and then the Ogdensburg Port Authority promoting its use among the universities and our broader region would increase the attractiveness of students coming to our region (which, by the way, enrollment has been declining recently and we must do all that we can to reverse that trend). Ogdensburg, with its airport terminal expansion project and other past improvements, has the ability to become the main regional airport by increasing options, not decreasing them by flying to redundant destinations like Philadelphia or the absolutely terrible Dulles (or Reagan) airports that also are severely limited in flight times to anywhere other than up and down the East coast. I&#39;m speaking from my experience where I frequently connect through O&#39;Hare, Dulles, JFK, Boston Logan, and Philadelphia and I&#39;ve travelled (and helped coordinate travel) from Ogdensburg, Plattsburgh, Saranac, Massena, Syracuse, Watertown, and Scranton, for myself 1-2 times per month to destinations all over the U.S. and internationally (and also helped coordinate travel for others domestically and internationally). We need to maximize the differences in options between our North Country airports, and we absolutely need an O&#39;Hare flight from Ogdensburg.",

While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization.

DEA has only publicly said that it is carrying out its review after receiving the HHS recommendation, without taking a specific position. In any case, the report says that the DEA officials are unconvinced by the health agency&rsquo;s conclusion that cannabis hold certain medical value, and they&rsquo;re concerned about issues related to increased THC potency. The sources also said that HHS officials have recently requested information from the Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) on the legal implications of marijuana rescheduling.&quot;<br/><br/>IF DEA and the AG are at odds, it is very important to hear from the professionals at DEA via their 8 factor. I feel that this is politically motivated by the Attorney General to get more votes for the President. Why are we rushing this right before an election?<br/><br/>I do not support rescheduling, this drug is a danger to society, and only hurts people.<br/><br/>The National Library of Medicine (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10635559/) reports &quot;Although cannabis is a naturally occurring plant with a long history of use by humans, the chemicals it contains, called cannabinoids, can act on the human body in many ways. Use of cannabis during important periods of development, such as during pregnancy and adolescence, can have a long-lasting impact on the way the brain forms and develops its systems to control emotions and other functions. This article gives an overview of some of the effects of cannabinoids on the developing brain, before birth and as teenagers, and provides information about how young people can prevent or minimize the negative effects of cannabis on their brains.&quot;<br/><br/>Why would we legalize something like this?<br/><br/>",

    "text": "As a student at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, I am heartened by FDA&rsquo;s efforts with the guidance draft titled, Real-World Evidence: Considerations Regarding Non-Interventional Studies for Drug and Biological Products Guidance for Industry. As our country continues to face existential threats to the public health in the form of high prescription drug prices, we must at least provide for manufacturers to prove efficacy beyond a reasonable doubt via real world evidence. <br/>Clinical trials continue to be one of the most expensive parts of drug development, costing millions of dollars per trial. Much of the cost of these trials increases exponentially with the addition of patients and clinical visits (1). It is therefore reasonable that evidence for FDA approval of a new molecular entity should seek to remove any overly extraneous requirements to prove efficacy and safety within reasonable boundaries. The implementation of real-world evidence and quasi-experimental designs clearly represents an opportunity for FDA to decrease the cost of proving efficacy and safety without unreasonably lowering its evidentiary standards. <br/>While this guidance in its draft form represents a step in the right direction, it can and should go further. In the Summary of the Proposed Approach, FDA notes that alternative study approaches should be addressed in any study rationales under this guidance. For clarity purposes, the language found on line 126, 130, and 133 should be updated to make it clear that alternative and ultimately rejected study designs should also be submitted to FDA. This approach allows manufacturers and FDA to both understand study rationale from a good faith standpoint. The bullet point found on line 133 should be updated such that representative samples from those data sources used in feasibility studies to determine appropriateness of alternative study designs should also be reported. This provision would allow FDA to verify claims of appropriateness by researchers, study sponsors, or evaluation teams. <br/>More broadly, the FDA guidance document would likely benefit from specific examples of acceptable quasi-experimental studies that utilize real world evidence, even if these examples are found in other guidance documents promulgated by FDA. Providing specific examples helps small biotechnology companies who are all too often the originators of innovative ideas but lack resources and regulatory expertise, causing them to outsource for such processes (2).  Lowering the regulatory burden for these companies allows them to thrive and introduce treatments that change lives for rare and common diseases alike. Such specific examples would also extend to various other bullet points in section III. For example, the bullet point at line 186 requires that protocols describe the &ldquo;relevance of the data to a drug-outcome association of interest.&rdquo; This bullet should include a citation or reference to other FDA literature that further outlines acceptable data types and specifics, or a specific example should be included. These citations or examples could most immediately direct readers to the FDA&rsquo;s framework on usage of real world evidence (3). Indeed, the guidance makes a reference to other applicable guidance in the introduction related to data appropriateness and relevance, highlighting the importance of quoting such resources. These actions clearly provide additional information that lowers the regulatory burden and uncertainty for researchers and manufacturers, particularly vulnerable small biotechnology organizations. <br/>Overall, the FDA guidance document reinforces the usage of real world evidence as outlined in the 21st Century Cures Act and overall FDA actions pursuant to that statute (4,5). FDA should continue to further implement real world evidence-based guidance and should consider how well ordered quasi experimental designs can supplement more expensive traditional randomized control trials. In the future FDA should also consider how quasi experimental designs can fulfill efficacy and safety standard requirements for supplemental applications seeking expanded indications for previously off label usages. These applications would benefit from real world evidence gathered during off label usage by prescribers preceding the supplemental application. Such a usage of RWE is supported by FDA officials comments and should continue to be implemented (6).<br/><br/>",

    "text": "DOD has just announced in the Federal Register &ldquo;Rules&rdquo; regarding the Stars and Stripes Media Organization, upon which you may want to comment (see 2024-08527 attached). Those rules do not articulate policy permitting Stars and Stripes reporters to submit FOIA requests (as they must be allowed to do), whereas DOD has separately expressly forbidden Stars and Stripes reporters from doing so. <br/><br/>DOD states:<br/>&ldquo;SUBJECT: FOIA Requests from the Stars and Stripes Newspaper.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Components are reminded that the Stars and Stripes Newspaper is an organization within the DoD, and as such, its personnel do not qualify as requesters under the FOIA.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Disclaimer. It is not clear to me that DOD senior leadership is aware of this infringement of Stars and Stripes employees First Amendment rights and other rights, nor is it clear that DOD senior leadership supports such infringement. <br/><br/>Background. <br/><br/>At the April 21, 2022 Chief FOIA Officers Council meeting Chad Garland of the Stars and Stripes media organization gave an oral presentation stating that DOD was denying Stars and Stripes writers from submitting FOIA requests. Mr. Garland also provided written public comments (see garland-comment-4-21-2022 attached https://www.archives.gov/files/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council/garland-comment-4.21.22.pdf ). Alina Semo, OGIS Director, failed to include any mention of this significant matter in her meeting minutes. https://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council/mtg-min-2022-04-21 <br/><br/>Narrative from the April 21 2024 meeting transcript is below:<br/><br/>https://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council/meetings/2022-04-21-transcript <br/><br/>Chad Garland:<br/><br/>Thank you. My name is Chad Garland. I&#39;m here in my personal capacity on a matter of public concern regarding FOIA compliance and transparency, namely a defense department policy that violates the FOIA rights of federal, civilian, and military personnel, and particularly the staff of Stars and Stripes Newspaper, who are members of the free press. At least five DOD memos sent to FOIA professionals since 1991 state that while any person may file a public records request, a &quot;representative of a federal agency&quot; may not. DOD has not defined representative federal agency, nor has it cited any statute regulation or directive that does, but these memos apply that phrase to Stars and Stripes personnel without qualification. These memos have been cited to deny employees personal rights on an unknown number of requests over the past 30 years, but well more than a dozen.<br/>In March last year, a new DOD memo provided that while Stars and Stripes reporters may file the FOIA request as individuals, their request must be denied if they fail to show proof that their federal employer gave them permission to make a request not on its behalf. Let that sink in. DOD says that because Congress expressly granted FOIA rights to any person, certain persons must get agency approval to file FOIA requests in their capacity as persons. The FOIA doesn&#39;t authorize such identity-based rules, but DOD claims that the statute requires this policy and that it has no discretion. Were that true, it would affect far more federal employees, if not all of them, as the FOIAs terms apply government wide. Agencies would have published implementing rules to that effect in the federal register, but DOD hasn&#39;t even published its policy there, nor does it enforce its policy equally against all DOD employees, despite regulations requiring that only laws and directives affecting all DOD employees will affect Stars and Stripes personnel.<br/>Rather, DOD unabashedly singles out Stars and Stripes reporters who differ from all other DOD employees in that regulations require that they be treated as members of the free press, not government officials. Yet DOD has told me outright that it considers them agency representatives exclusively because of their press status. Any other federal employee may make a FOIA request in a personal capacity, DOD has said, but not those who self-identify as members of the press, whether in their requests, or otherwise. As it&#39;s designed and implemented, this policy is clearly discriminating against federal employees for how they use their first amendment rights, and it must be rescinded. To ensure FOIA compliance and transparency, I think all agency rules should affirm that when invoking FOIA, federal employees must be treated as any person asserting their private rights, unless the request explicitly states otherwise. I&#39;ve submitted written comments to provide further details. Thank you.<br/>",

    "text": "Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

    "text": "I am writing to express my opposition to the recommendation to move botanical marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).<br/>Rescheduling marijuana would exacerbate the public health harms caused by marijuana. Although the marijuana industry markets high THC products as medicine, there has been no research supporting the use of wax, shatter or high THC vape oil for medical purposes. This has caused both youth and adults to believe these products are safe. A study in the Journal of Pediatrics found that instances of children under the age of six accidentally ingesting marijuana has jumped 1,375% from 2017 to 2021, climbing from 200 per year to more than 3,000 per year. Marijuana users are 25% more likely to need emergency care and hospitalization. <br/>Marijuana use is very concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, &ldquo;adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school&rdquo;.  Colorado warns, &ldquo;Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana&rdquo; Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, the National Institute on Drug Abuse noted, &ldquo;researchers are still studying how long marijuana&rsquo;s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent&rdquo;.<br/>Marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011.<br/>The recommendation from HHS failed to take into account actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Marijuana can be addictive; In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, &ldquo;using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder&rdquo;. Research shows that marijuana use changes the structure of the brain and heavy, lifelong use can result in IQ loss.<br/>With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30 percent of cases of schizophrenia among 21&ndash;30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. <br/>Since botanical cannabis did not meet previous criteria for currently accepted medical use (CAMU), HHS pretextually changed the definition of CAMU Even using this broader definition, botanical cannabis fails to meet CAMU criteria. <br/>&ldquo;Widespread&rdquo; implies that the drug is broadly accepted and utilized within the medical community, but this is not the case. HHS states that 30,000 licensed health care practitioners (LHCPs) are authorized to recommend the use of marijuana, but this number represents fewer than 3% of LHCPs with prescriptive authority.<br/>As evidence of &ldquo;some scientific support for one medical use&rdquo;, HHS states that science supports botanical cannabis for &ldquo;anorexia related to a medical condition; nausea and vomiting (e.g., chemotherapy-induced); and pain&rdquo;. HHS conflates isolated cannabinoids and crude cannabis products. It does not follow that botanical cannabis &ndash; with multiple active chemicals &ndash; will have the same effect as medications with small, specified doses of a single active chemical. While dronabinol has been shown to alleviate symptoms of nausea and vomiting, botanical marijuana use can lead to intractable vomiting &ndash; Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome.<br/>Safety is a major concern as traffic fatalities, psychosis, suicide, violence, depression, mania, maternal-fetal harms, and addiction have been associated with the use of botanical marijuana.<br/>Marijuana use is also associated with cardiovascular health issues. According to the American Heart Association, marijuana use without tobacco use can increase heart disease risk by 300%  Furthermore, heart attacks are twice as likely in young adults who used marijuana.<br/>Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state.<br/>I encourage you to follow the science and public health evidence on this issue and keep marijuana in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act.",

Agencies would have published implementing rules to that effect in the federal register, but DOD hasn&#39;t even published its policy there, nor does it enforce its policy equally against all DOD employees, despite regulations requiring that only laws and directives affecting all DOD employees will affect Stars and Stripes personnel.<br/>Rather, DOD unabashedly singles out Stars and Stripes reporters who differ from all other DOD employees in that regulations require that they be treated as members of the free press, not government officials. Yet DOD has told me outright that it considers them agency representatives exclusively because of their press status. Any other federal employee may make a FOIA request in a personal capacity, DOD has said, but not those who self-identify as members of the press, whether in their requests, or otherwise. As it&#39;s designed and implemented, this policy is clearly discriminating against federal employees for how they use their first amendment rights, and it must be rescinded. To ensure FOIA compliance and transparency, I think all agency rules should affirm that when invoking FOIA, federal employees must be treated as any person asserting their private rights, unless the request explicitly states otherwise. I&#39;ve submitted written comments to provide further details. Thank you.<br/>",

    "text": "Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

Humphrey Building<br/>200 Independence Avenue, SW<br/>Washington, D.C. 20201<br/><br/>Re: Support for Continuation of the Low-Wage Hospital Policy in CMS-1808-P<br/><br/>Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure:<br/><br/>I am deeply appreciative of your initial support for the Low-Wage Hospital Policy, a crucial component of the CMS Fiscal Year 2025 Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System proposed rule. This policy, with its three-year continuation, represents a significant stride in addressing the disparities in the Medicare area wage index and stands to benefit millions of patients across rural America. However, the reality is that rural hospitals, already grappling with limited resources and financial constraints, are facing an uphill battle in delivering high-quality healthcare services to our community. Many of these hospitals in Tennessee are operating on thin profit margins or even at a loss, a trend that has persisted since the post-pandemic period. We are in a critical situation, and the continuation of the Low-Wage Hospital Policy is our best hope for a sustainable future. <br/><br/>Over two decades, most hospitals in my home state of Tennessee have experienced a stark decrease in wage index rates. This has occurred despite rising costs and increased wages. The result has been significantly reduced reimbursements when caring for patients. The cumulative effect has been that our region, over time, has had drastically less funding than other regions to attract and retain medical staff to serve our area&rsquo;s patients. It has also contributed to Tennessee&#39;s second-highest rural hospital closures nationwide. CMS&rsquo; Low-Wage Hospital Policy shows strong potential for improving this harmful situation, and I hope you will keep the three-year continuation of the policy in the final rule. <br/><br/>The Low-Wage Hospital Policy has been a lifeline for rural hospitals, not just in my home state but across the country. Its inclusion in the final rule is not just important, it is of utmost importance. I implore CMS to recognize the significant impact of this policy and its potential for improvement. This policy is not just a lifeline, but a beacon of hope for rural healthcare, and its continuation is not just crucial, it is our duty for the well-being of our communities. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Stacey Mohr, BSN RN<br/>Office: 931-459-7024<br/>Smohr@covhlth.com<br/>Quality and Patient Safety Manager<br/>Cumberland Medical Center Covenant Health",

This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco&rsquo;s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. <br/><br/>HHS&#39; recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, &ldquo;using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.&rdquo; <br/><br/>With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21&ndash;30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. <br/><br/>Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, &ldquo;adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.&rdquo;  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, &ldquo;Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores.

Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that &ldquo;encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.&rdquo; <br/><br/>I encourage you to follow the science and public health evidence on this issue and keep marijuana in Schedule I.",

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

For starters, rescheduling it would give scientists around the Country the ability to thoroughly investigate the possible medicinal benefits cannabis may have to offer. Secondly, the taxes revenue that would come from cannabis sales would greatly benefit each and every state with any projects they may be currently attempting to fund, which in turn would directly take the money out of the hands of drug dealers across America. Third, lowering the schedule would allow the FDA to get involved and make sure that any medical marijuana that makes its way to its patients could have the FDA&rsquo;s seal of approval, which would give any possible patients peace  of mind that the medicine they have is in fact safe. Lastly, a friend of mine, that I would go to far as say my brother, passed away in 2021 due to a drug dealer lacing his cannabis with Fentanyl. The chances of this happening would have been drastically reduced had we proceeded with this rescheduling sooner.

The people who wanted it illegal cherry pick some negatives and leave out a mountain of positives to manipulate their sought outcomes. <br/><br/>That all said we shouldn&#39;t be supporting a criminal market through prohibition but supporting free agency and free will in a supposedly free country with a focus on regulation where an illegal market has none.

While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

    "text": "In 2016 the FDA recommended that marijuana stay in schedule I due to it had no legitimate medical purpose. They stated there is no support for rescheduling Marijuana. President Biden then tells HHS to reschedule it. HHS then provided an 8 factor analysis supporting a change to schedule III. The new HHS 8 factor has no new data or nothing that supports the rescheduling&#39;s. Part the scheduling process is that DEA provide an 8 factor concerning this rescheduling. The rule does not have any DEA 8 factor attached for review. <br/><br/>Marijuana Moments reports (https://www.marijuanamoment.net/dea-officials-reportedly-at-odds-with-biden-admin-over-marijuana-rescheduling-push/) that DEA and the AG are at odds in rescheduling stating &quot;Officials with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) are reportedly resisting calls to reschedule marijuana, creating tension with the White House as President Joe Biden continues to tout his role in directing the cannabis review. That&rsquo;s according to an article published by The Wall Street Journal on Saturday, with the report citing &ldquo;people familiar with the matter&rdquo; who say certain DEA officials are disputing scientific findings from the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) that led it to recommend moving marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).Some advocates and stakeholders have challenged the reporting, questioning the possible motivations of the anonymous sources. DEA has only publicly said that it is carrying out its review after receiving the HHS recommendation, without taking a specific position. In any case, the report says that the DEA officials are unconvinced by the health agency&rsquo;s conclusion that cannabis hold certain medical value, and they&rsquo;re concerned about issues related to increased THC potency. The sources also said that HHS officials have recently requested information from the Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) on the legal implications of marijuana rescheduling.&quot;<br/><br/>IF DEA and the AG are at odds, it is very important to hear from the professionals at DEA via their 8 factor. I feel that this is politically motivated by the Attorney General to get more votes for the President. Why are we rushing this right before an election?<br/><br/>I do not support rescheduling, this drug is a danger to society, and only hurts people.<br/><br/>The National Library of Medicine (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10635559/) reports &quot;Although cannabis is a naturally occurring plant with a long history of use by humans, the chemicals it contains, called cannabinoids, can act on the human body in many ways. Use of cannabis during important periods of development, such as during pregnancy and adolescence, can have a long-lasting impact on the way the brain forms and develops its systems to control emotions and other functions. This article gives an overview of some of the effects of cannabinoids on the developing brain, before birth and as teenagers, and provides information about how young people can prevent or minimize the negative effects of cannabis on their brains.&quot;<br/><br/>Why would we legalize something like this?<br/><br/>",

    "text": "I urge the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to promote Americans&rsquo; health by setting voluntary sodium reduction targets for processed, packaged, and prepared foods and beverages.  <br/><br/>Adult Americans are currently consuming about 50 percent more sodium than is recommended by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), among other health authorities &ndash; and most sodium consumption in the U.S. occurs through commercial food processing and preparation (including restaurants). Given the ubiquity of sodium in the food supply, consumers are limited in what they can do to protect themselves. But government-established voluntary targets can prompt industry to reformulate its products, reducing the toll of high blood pressure and heart disease. <br/><br/>FDA took steps towards addressing this crisis in 2016 when it issued a draft guidance with both short- (2-year) and long-term (10-year) targets. The short-term targets have been finalized, but not the longer-term ones. Only FDA has the ability to encourage industry to act, and we urge it to do so by setting these targets as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Edward Shortsleeve<br/>NY",

While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization.

Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization.

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

    "text": "I am writing on behalf of The Justice Diversity Center of the Bar Association of San Francisco (JDC) in response to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, &ldquo;Application of Certain Mandatory Bars in Fear Screenings,&rdquo; which was published on May 13, 2024.<br/><br/>JDC is one of the largest and most distinguished legal services providers in San Francisco. Through its Immigrant Legal Defense Program (ILDP) JDC provides legal services to newly arrived migrants and their families appearing before the San Francisco Immigration Court. Through its Attorney of the Day Program, JDC attorneys and volunteers provide legal consultations to thousands of unrepresented respondents each year, the vast majority of whom are seeking asylum in the United States. JDC staff also coordinates services with 15 other San Francisco non-profit organizations as the legal lead to the San Francisco Immigrant Legal Defense Collaborative (SFILDC). The SFILDC has provided full scope removal defense representation to over 1,700 San Francisco residents, many of whom are seeking asylum. <br/><br/>JDC strongly opposes the proposed changes to the Credible Fear Screening process. If implemented, these changes will negatively impact an individual&rsquo;s right to seek asylum by allowing Asylum Officers (AOs) to make determinations about an individual&rsquo;s ability to qualify for relief too early in the process. Asylum allows individuals and their families to escape from the violence and fear in their home countries and it is a vital part of humanitarian aid provided by the United States. An individual who is granted asylum can work in the United States and contribute to the economy, apply for residency and citizenship, and most importantly, can flee a country where their life was in danger. This proposed rule creates additional risks that a refugee fleeing violence in their home country will be wrongfully prevented from applying for asylum by an AO at a time when the asylum seeker is most vulnerable and lacks access to resources. It is crucial that the asylum process is protected, as this rule does not align with years of United States Asylum law precedent or international law and would increase due process inadequacies.<br/><br/>",

You will single handedly destroy a majority  of them that serve small communities. And with the Biden economics that have buried folks in debt, we cannot ask them to fund this. 14k plus in costs to enact this? That&#39;s 20% of my annual budget that we can barely operate on. We are over an hour and a half away from help so if you enact these items we will have to close the doors. The town will become a ghost town without a fire dept or ambulance. We already struggle to get volunteers and enough money to operate. You will put us out of business. Fire departments all over the country struggle with budgets and employees. This is not a huge surprise. Everyone struggles. And the Biden administrations solution is to regulate us to death? Not surprised. Anything to turn us into a 3rd world country. ",

If implemented, this new rule would further erode the important due process protections in place to ensure that individuals seeking protection at the U.S.-Mexico border aren&#39;t mistakenly returned to a country where their life may be threatened. The rule the administration is proposing would make it easier for immigration officials at the border to ignore requests for protection from asylum seekers. While on the surface it appears to be efficient, in practice this rule is just adding to the challenges facing people seeking safety in the U.S. <br/><br/>The likely impact of this rule will be that individuals who have viable asylum claims under U.S. law will be wrongfully removed due to unfair procedures. Life-and-death decisions will be made based on information gathered during the credible fear process, with little access to legal support, and in the moments when asylum seekers are most traumatized and exhausted from their journey.<br/><br/>U.S. laws and treaties protect asylum seekers and prohibit their return to countries where they face persecution and torture. The rule would deny protection to asylum seekers and require them to return to countries without meaningful protection and where they may still be in harm&#39;s way. This is why I am encouraging the administration to rescind this rule.  <br/><br/>Thank you.",

I think Fire Departments should be exempt like they were 27 years ago. When looking at the statistics, it takes way more than two firefighter to perform a rescue of a down firefighter. Also, while staying outside of the building we are preventing putting our citizens first. If we go in with adequate staffing we can put civilians first. I think that in our area these standards are restricting our ability to put civilians first. I would like to compare building fire to an active shooter. If we don&#39;t get in and stop the damage or carnage on people then it will get worse for everyone. As we know fire are down but fire deaths and injuries for civilian are up in comparison to the amount of fires which needs to stop. We tell civilians that we will come for them but now we are going to be handcuffed. We can&#39;t use clues like cars, neighbors or outside clues to tell if people are in the buildings due to the variety of economic standings post covid. I am worried that some of these regulations are going to put some fire department out of service completely. ",

    "text": "Hello, first and foremost thank you for taking the time to read what I have pulled together. I feel this topic is beyond critical to the safety of the American people and I hope this is read with an open mind to the point being made. Firstly, the two in/two out over the past 26 years has been proven to do more harm to the citizens that relay on us, than the good it does to the rescuers it was created to help. I feel it&rsquo;s important to point out that 93.5% of maydays that are called by fire service personnel are more than 15 minutes into the incident duration. The reasons behind this are simple, not only are crews becoming fatigued at this point, but so are the buildings! It is no hidden fact that today buildings are being built with cheaper and cheaper materials, less mature wood, and non true dimensional lumber. All of which play a role in the stability and fire damage that can be with-stained. It is more imperative today than it has ever been in the history of the fire service to get into these building as quickly as possible to make affective searches and remove victims, BEFORE the fire has time to grow and weaken the structure. The two in/two out rule could in some cases keep fire service personnel out of the building while the fire is growing inside and weakening the structure for 2-5 minutes if not more. 2-5 minutes isn&rsquo;t that long, is it? Well&hellip; if you ask the AHA is it, in fact according to the AHA every minute CPR is delayed lowers survival rates of 10%. Meaning if you are delaying crews by 5 minutes, you&rsquo;re lowering the odds of the victims survival by 50%. Would you take those odds for you? Would you take those odds for your loved ones? Kids? I know I wouldn&rsquo;t. The day the public sees the fire service waiting outside for the next crew to arrive to establish the two in/two out while their loved ones and all their personal belongings are perishing inside is the day the public loses trust in us, the people that swore to protect them. But wait&hellip; the proposed two in two out rule states if there&rsquo;s known victims inside the house we can bypass it, right? Well I can tell you, speaking from experience and I know many many many other fireman who can say the same thing, when someone&rsquo;s home is burning to the ground in front of their eyes, they&rsquo;ve breathed in hot toxic air, and may be hypoxic and running off adrenaline, people forget things. People forget people. They forget about their little boys friends who are staying the night and they&rsquo;re not outside with them, they forget their sister is in town for the weekend and they haven&rsquo;t come out yet. It happens, it&rsquo;s the human brain and it makes mistakes. Not to mention all the neighbors that are being helpful saying &ldquo;their car isn&rsquo;t home they&rsquo;re not in there&rdquo;. Maybe they loaned their car to a friend? Or maybe it&rsquo;s at the shop getting fixed? My point is there are too many variables to play with when it comes to human lives that we&rsquo;ve sworn to protect. Lastly I would like to wrap this up with one more statistic. Did you know that 88% of maydays are resolved by crews already operating inside? So that means, 88% of the time a fireman is in trouble someone inside with them helps them out or rescues them, NOT the RIT team or the two out outside. Again, thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope all the point made have been taken into consideration. ",

    "text": "Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry.

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether, I nonetheless support the factual basis underlying the HHS recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. <br/><br/>The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis &ldquo;has a currently accepted medical use&rdquo; and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. HHS reached this determination per a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be safely administered under medical supervision.<br/><br/>Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients&rsquo; access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. <br/><br/>Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to &ldquo;move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, &ldquo;The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,&rdquo; such as benzodiazepines &mdash; a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, &ldquo;No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether &ndash; thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states &ndash; I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying the HHS recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject the HHS findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.",

Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

It is safer than alcohol and cigarettes. No one has ever died from its use.

I refuse to live in any state where it is not legal for medical use, but that is not good enough.

Resistant weeds are one of the greatest challenges facing farmers across my area now and in the years to come.  Our options for weed control in corn &amp; soybean are already very limited.  Although Dicamba brings it&#39;s share of management challenges, I think it&#39;s critical for farmers to have access to low-volatility Dicamba products in the future.  I do believe common sense regulations are important for reducing off-target movement of Dicamba.  However, removing access to Dicamba altogether will put more pressure on the few products we have in our toolbelt to control resistant weeds and increase selection pressure on herbicides like Liberty and Enlist One.

Similar to Round-Up we are now making policy based on non-scientific opinions which are usually in the best interest of everyone but the farmer.  Here in Nebraska (which is a very windy state) we have had no issues with our drift.  I hear more complaints come from the competitor seed dealer who has the Enlist platform more than my neighbors and even though the litigation came from someone else it looks like they have succeeded.  The more herbicides that get removed from my arsenal the more expensive it is going to be to produce a crop.  With this new ruling even if we get a label for pre-emergent sprays we are now down to two over the top sprays and one doesn&#39;t even work very well in dry conditions.  My point is without Dicamba as a spray we are just going to create a bigger problem in the future with weed resistance.  Also with the way the courts are ruling on labels, I do not see how the chemical companies can create new herbicides fast enough and get a label approved for us to use them once current herbicides get banned like Dicamba.  Prices for production as usual will go up and once again it&#39;s the farmer that loses.  I&#39;m asking for help, I&#39;m asking for common sense, and I&#39;m praying for a miracle.

This particular weed species is highly prolific and competitive in both soybean and cotton cropping systems. Economic yield loss risk can drive production well below breakeven. The continued availability of this tool would prove to be a significant part of the family farms risk management program. The loss of this technology could prove to be devastating to all resistance management systems that involve the mentioned weed species.<br/><br/>Low-volatility dicamba products are widely used throughout the United States to broaden the spectrum of weed species management. It is one of the best tools available to control weeds, especially as farmers face increased weed resistance against certain herbicides.  Dicamba-tolerant systems were used on as many as 78% of all U.S. cotton acres and at least 45% of all U.S. soybean acres in 2023.  This product has been critical for many farmers with limited options to address weed resistance issues and is part of their weed management strategies.  <br/><br/>Over-the-top use of low volatility dicamba is safe and effective when used according to the EPA approved FIFRA label.  It allows farmers to adopt climate smart agricultural practices that promote conservation measures that reduce soil eroision and run-off.  It also helps promote maximum yield potential.  The loss of this important tool would have a negative economic impact on farmers that would be forced to potentially use less effective alternatives and lower yields.<br/><br/>Low volatility dicamba is an important herbicide for modern agricultural practices.  It provides a safe and reliable pesticide product for farmers and the best option based on recommendations from their local agronomist / certified crop advisor.  I urge EPA to act quickly on this product registration in order to provide America&#39;s agricultural industry with regulatory certainty as the industry continues to feel the impact of the February 2024, federal court decision to vacate the 2020 registrations for over-the-top dicamba products.  <br/><br/>It is important EPA approves this product registration following all necessary procedures in an expeditious manner.

    "text": "I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. <br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco&rsquo;s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. <br/><br/>HHS&#39; recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, &ldquo;using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.&rdquo; <br/><br/>With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21&ndash;30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. <br/><br/>Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, &ldquo;adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.&rdquo;  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, &ldquo;Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.&rdquo; Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, &ldquo;researchers are still studying how long marijuana&rsquo;s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Finally, while some states recognize &ldquo;medical marijuana&rdquo; there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that &ldquo;encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.&rdquo; <br/><br/>I encourage you to follow the science and public health evidence on this issue and keep marijuana in Schedule I.",

    "text": "I recently received a National Ocean Month list of Biden Administration Stratagies for 2024 which included one on Ocean Biodiversity which might <br/>be effected by Floating Ocean Wind Turbines in the Gulf of Maine between Chatham, Ma. and Ellsworth, Me.  Wind farms in open ocean waters<br/>attract fouling organisms (macro algae and various bacteria, fungi, microfauna and macro-invertebrates (fouling organisms) and the pelagic fish <br/>/ marine mammals that feed on these attached organisms (Black Sea bass, grey seals and Great White Sharks providing a case study in <br/>southern New England as a result of climate change/global warming)).  Even though the hard substrate prey and their pelagic predators increase<br/>species biodiversity and evenness measures, many of the species are considered &ldquo;invasive&rdquo; or &quot;nuisance members&quot; of the aquatic ecosystem by <br/>human users.  Since James Price represents BOEM on the Interagency Working Group on Biodiversity,  how does the agency plan to address <br/>nuisance species amongst the fouling organisms and their pelagic predators ?  Goal three of the National Ocean Biodiversity Strategy mentions <br/>protecting, conserving and sustaining ocean biodiversity&rsquo;s natural capital and ecosystem services (for both human uses and socioeconomic gain).<br/>How does BOEM plan to address these challenges in the three floating wind turbine zones in the Gulf of Maine ?<br/><br/>I conducted my dissertation research on fouling organisms that interfered with the growth of oysters in raft based aquaculture operations in coastal<br/>Georgia.  The fouling organisms community composition and metabolism change seasonally and interfered with the growth and harvest of oysters.<br/>The rafts were lifted out of the water during the Winter in order to kill the fouling orgasms which allowed the oysters to grow and reach maturity for <br/>harvesting.  The oysters being inter-tidal organisms survived short term exposure to the Winter air.  I presume floating wind turbines have some <br/>procedures for removing fouling organisms and making wind turbines survive Winter storms without breaking their cables and going AWOL in the <br/>wider ocean.<br/><br/>Max Mosler (University. of Washington) wrote a short response to a paper on maximizing ocean biodiversity by building &quot;No Take&rdquo; Marine <br/>Protected Areas to restore ocean biodiversity.  He pointed out that: &quot;The orthodoxy reflected in Gignoux-Wolfsohn et al. 2024  is that no-take MPAs<br/> are the most effective form of biodiversity protection; yet it is widely accepted that there are many non-fishing threats to marine biodiversity like <br/>global warming, ocean acidification, sea level rise, exotic species, shipping, coastal development, and terrestrial runoff of sediments and pollutants. <br/>No-take MPAs have no impact on those threats.&rdquo;  Floating ocean wind turbines might be added to this list as habitats for exotic species in the open <br/>ocean.  Climate change and global warming will create a &ldquo;Shifting Baseline&rdquo; in the Gulf of Maine, even if floating wind turbine farms are created <br/>in this region.  An ecosystem-based monitoring program is required to ensure that these shifts in wild places, wild things are not due to <br/>ocean wind farms. A lot of the ocean wind farm opponents use such changes to eliminate the need for ocean wind farms to decrease greenhouse <br/>gases in the atmosphere and future release of methane from the ocean bottom water and sediments (below the ocean twilight zone which may be <br/>effected by changes in the permanent ocean thermocline).<br/><br/>Neither the NROC (Northeast Regional Ocean Council) or Gulf of Maine Wind Energy Task Force meetings addressed these concerns which is <br/>why I submitted this personal comment.  Ocean biodiversity is an important component of sustainable development of wind farms and needs to<br/>be addressed by BOEM and its Federal/State partners.",

I have been working on identification, characterization and management of Colletotrichum species causing apple bitter rot for the last 9 years. This disease, along with its leaf infection called Glomerella Leaf Spot, has been a significant issue for managing in commercial apple orchards across the Eastern Board of the U.S.A. The loses from apple bitter rot in the Mid-Atlantic in the last 9 years ranged from 2 - 100% in field and up to 15% in apple storages.<br/><br/>We have conducted four years of fungicide experiments in the field and also tested fungicides in the laboratory. We have tested both single-site and multi-site fungicides, alone throughout the summer season, during high apple bitter rot pressure. Consistently for two years, Ziram as a multi-site fungicide has shown a high efficacy in apple bitter rot management and is a very much needed alternative to multi-site fungicides mancozeb and captan for growers to use for apple bitter rot management during the summer months, before apple harvest. This multi-site fungicide is a necessary alternative to manzate due to PHI of 77 days applicable to manzate but not to ziram. Growers have to switch to Ziram for early season maturing apples and to prevent various fungal problems mid and later in the season. If this affordable , effective product is taken off the market for usage on apples, a valuable alternative multi-site fungicide that growers use will continue to reduce the fresh and processing apple production in the Mid-Atlantic due to issues from apple bitter rot infections that are increasing. Ziram is also a key component for anti-resistance strategy for single-site fungicides that many growers currently apply 6-8 times for apple bitter rot control (specifically, strobilurins). Ziram is an important tank-mix partner for strobilurins and other single-site fungicides effective for apple bitter rot  (e.g. benzovindiflupyr and fluazinam) that broadens the specter of efficacy of the spray tank mix to avoid resistance occurrence in Colletotrichum species that cause apple bitter rot. The resistance in  Colletotrichum species to single-site fungicides, including strobilurins, has been reported throughout the world. Eliminating ziram from the market would prevent wholesale, pick-your own and retail apple producers to run their Agricultural businesses. Loss of ziram would severely limit or stop profitability  of these businesses as the costs of apple protection from apple bitter rot would increase and reduce farm profitability or eliminate large number of farms from the market due to inability to earn profit from apple production. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading these comments concerning my data based professional concern with the EPA&#39;s proposed delisting of Ziram on apples.<br/><br/>Srdjan Acimovic<br/>Assistant Professor<br/>Tree Fruit and Specialty Crop Pathologist<br/>Virginia Tech<br/>School of Plant and Environmental Sciences<br/>Alson H.

    "text": "June 3, 2024<br/>Michael Regan, Administrator<br/>Environmental Protection Agency<br/>1200 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W.<br/>Washington, DC  20460<br/><br/>Dear Administrator Regan,<br/><br/>The Tennessee Department of Agriculture is sending this letter to express our support for the continued use of low-volatile dicamba products. The loss of low-volatile dicamba products would put a significant strain on growers in Tennessee trying to control broadleaf weeds that significantly jeopardize yield in the row crops vitally important to our state&rsquo;s agriculture industry and rural economy. <br/><br/>Growers in Tennessee understand now more than ever the consequences of improper applications of dicamba and strive to make every possible effort to keep dicamba on its intended target. In recent years, the Tennessee Department of Agriculture has seen a significant decrease in dicamba-related complaints. We recorded 55 complaints in 2018, then 22 in 2019, 22 in 2020, 24 in 2021, 9 in 2022, 5 in 2023, and 0 so far in 2024. We believe this reduction in complaints is due to the extensive outreach and education provided to growers by the Tennessee Department of Agriculture and University of Tennessee (UT) Extension, and particularly the dicamba training module developed by UT. <br/><br/>Tennessee has an estimated 2 million acres of soybeans and 300,000 acres of cotton grown annually. Approximately 90% of those acres are dicamba-tolerant (Xtend) technology. Low-volatile dicamba products are critical for these growers to combat resistant weeds such as roughfruit amaranth (waterhemp) and palmer amaranth (pigweed). There are no other post-emerge herbicides that can adequately control these glyphosate-, ALS-, and PPO-resistant weeds in-crop like dicamba can alone, or when partnered with products such as glufosinate (Liberty). Research has proven dicamba partnered with glufosinate controls these yield-robbing weeds in Xtend crops when no other herbicides can. Having the option to rotate these two active ingredients will control these weeds and help cut down on resistance issues.<br/><br/>Another concerning note to growers in Tennessee is the proposed application cut-off for soybeans. Not having low-volatile dicamba available as a post-emerge (over-the-top) option in soybeans can be detrimental to growers. Again, dicamba is one of the only options to control resistant weeds post-emerge and denying the 90% of Xtend soybean growers that option will open their crop up to significant yield loss if those weeds go uncontrolled.<br/><br/>The Tennessee Department of Agriculture would like to thank EPA for considering a new low-volatile dicamba label for 2025 and the potential for negative impacts on Tennessee growers if they lose this technology. We also urge EPA to consider allowing use of low volatile dicamba post-emerge in soybeans. If a new label or other changes are approved, the Tennessee Department of Agriculture and UT Extension will continue to educate and partner with growers to properly steward dicamba technology. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/>Charlie Hatcher, D.V.M.<br/>Commissioner, Tennessee Department of Agriculture<br/>",

Logically, why would we lower the schedule on something that is causing psychosis in those who are using it (both medically, and illegally)?? Marijuana is something that is very addictive (although there is a whole generation of people who were taught otherwise), and is keeping future generations from thriving. People are committing suicide, inducing depression, and increasing their anxiety from marijuana use,  but the health of the people is being ignored for a dollar. This change is not for the betterment of the people, it&#39;s for the money that big corporations and stakeholders can make. Do the RIGHT THING and keep marijuana as a Schedule I, both federally and locally.<br/><br/>I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. <br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco&rsquo;s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. <br/><br/>HHS&#39; recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, &ldquo;using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.&rdquo; <br/><br/>With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21&ndash;30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented.

Examples of bundles include severe hypertension in pregnancy, obstetric hemorrhage, perinatal mental health conditions, and postpartum discharge transition. <br/><br/>Additionally, IPPS should include upward adjustments tied to hospitals&rsquo; longitudinal improvement or lack thereof in outcomes and racial/ethnic outcomes disparities. Certain outcomes, such as maternal mortality, are better suited to statewide surveillance rather than hospital-level measurement. However, severe maternal morbidity and rates of nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex Cesarean births can be tracked and disaggregated by race / ethnicity and payer type, while controlling for the mother&rsquo;s social vulnerability / area disparity.<br/><br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Specifically, we solicit comment on what the overarching requirements and structure should be for a possible future obstetrical services CoP.

Primary care physicians and obstetricians should be financially incentivized for completing and sharing standardized, whole-health assessments of pregnant people during their first trimester. Screenings must address prenatal and postnatal mental health and substance use, and warm referrals to qualified behavioral health providers.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Adoption of culturally appropriate, team-based obstetric and perinatal care: Obstetricians should be incentivized for utilizing nurse care managers, doulas, and community health workers who attend to the pregnant person&rsquo;s whole health needs, including health-related social needs. Care management must include regular co-management across the obstetrician, PCP, and pediatrician. <br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Payment for extended postpartum care, for patients with complications<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Payment for certain, well-defined social care services: These services should include medically tailored meals, home safety improvements, and income assistance, particularly for unhoused / precariously housed pregnant individuals.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Payment for use of FDA-approved patient monitoring devices: Certain low-tech devices (e.g., scales, pulse-oximeters) are relatively inexpensive but highly impactful for moderate-risk patients.

There are risks in identifying minimum standards/measures, particularly for rural and underserved communities. If the changes to CoP do not consider the limited resources in many areas of the United States, minimum standards could produce unintended consequences. Changes could inadvertently lead to an increase obstetric care deserts. It could cause more patients to choose to deliver outside of facilities due to lack of local resources, potentially increasing avoidable harm in the obstetric population. CMS should define CoPs with the entire population in mind, for example, rural communities or geographically isolated areas like Alaska.

President Biden as said many times that no person should be in jail for cannabis, and simply rescheduling it continues its status of Federal illegality. Over half the population of the U.S. live in a state where cannabis is legal, and completely descheduling it would prevent users in those states from being at risk of consequences from breaking Federal law. These consequences can include being fired from a Federal job, not receiving housing support, and risking arrest from Federal officers. This status of being both legal and illegal is confusing and makes it harder for law enforcement and judges to do their jobs.

    "text": "As former frequent flyer who used to travel 100+ flights a year living in a major west cost city, here are some thoughts.<br/><br/>Philadelphia as a destination seems redundant. Currently Watertown, Ogdensburg, AND Plattsburg all offer flight to Philadelphia. 3 seems unnecessary. Yes, multiple options that are closer to one is nice, but living in North Country, having to drive a distance to service is just an accepted part of life. Next, Philadelphia is a hub city, but it is mainly a hub city for American Airlines. For United or Delta flyers, there are no clear options. If Ogdensburg offers flight to Washington Dulles or Newark, both a United hub, it would give United flyers an option while keeping American flyers to Philadelphia an option from Watertown. I was an American Airline frequent flier with nearly a million miles on AA, so this would be a benefit to me, but honestly I rather have more options because competition is a good thing for us, and this impacts everyone, not just people who likes to earn American Airlines miles.<br/><br/>Interlining agreement is more convenient, without a doubt. Check in at Ogdensburg and don&rsquo;t need to worry about check in again, baggage, etc. However, in my past personal experience, a ticket to and from under served EAS cities like Ogdensburg always seems much more expensive. While Ogdensburg to the hub can be capped to a certain amount, once adding a leg to the next destination raises the price significantly. In my experience, more often than not it is cheaper to book two separate flights and get a better price than one. Doing this means the lack of interlining convenience and adding the risk that if the first flight is delayed, the airline is not obligated to rebook you for the second. However, many residents of St. Lawrence county who are leisure travelers are likely to be more price sensitive. For me personally, the only times I&rsquo;ve used Ogdensburg or Massena airport, was when I only needed to go where there is a direct flight, so that was Dulles when Ogdensburg used to fly there direct, and Baltimore when Boutique flew there direct out of Massena. When I need to do at least a connection, the cost becomes prohibitive that I drive to Newark or Montreal. I know others do something similar and fly out of Syracuse.<br/><br/>In terms of capturing the Canadian market, flights to Florida for a reasonable price could be attractive to leisure travelers from across the border. Air Canada has a stranglehold on the Canadian Aviation market, and Canadian air fares are prohibitively high. For business and government travelers based out of Ottawa and Montreal, they expense the tickets and convenience is more important, but for leisure travelers in Canada, particularly the Snowbirds who travel to Florida seasonally, this could be an attractive option.<br/><br/>This is the least important, but still a nice bonus: Breeze proposes using Airbus A220 aircraft. These were formerly known as the Bombardier C-Series, until Bombardier was forced to sell to Airbus due to Boeing anti-competitive lobbying. Most of them are built across the river in Montreal. The aircraft had the first flight less than 10 years ago. They are new, spacious, and comfortable. Boutique Air operates the Pilatus. It is a comfortable plane, but as a turboprop they are loud and more susceptible to turbulence due to size. Contour Air operates the older Embraer regional jets, and those are a lot more cramped. In terms of comfort the Airbus A220 wins hands down.<br/>My ideal option would be an airline that offers flight to major hubs like Newark/JKF, Chicago, or Dallas, but base on the three choices, I believe Breeze is the best choice out the three despite lack of interlining agreement.<br/><br/>Boutique Air already has a presence out of Massena to a major hub, and the planes are louder<br/>Contour Air operates out of Philadelphia, which is redundant<br/>Breeze has a modern fleet and offers flights to a Dallas, and is run by a CEO with an excellent track record at operating airlines.<br/>",

    "text": "I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Moreover, moving it to schedule III is a deliberate lie to all of the people who voted for you after your promise of legalization. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use, as well as imposing significant anti-trust legislation to prevent the whitewashing of corporate cannabis and to keep the industry equitable and focused on small businesses and drug war reparations. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",

In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.&mdash;70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll&mdash;support cannabis legalization. <br/><br/>But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health &amp; Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient.

Specifically, I suggest: broadening the definition of CHW to include peer support staff, recovery coaches, doulas, navigators and others; leveraging CHWs involved in vaccination education to also support other public health efforts (e.g., HIV, maternal and child health); supporting global-to-local information exchange to help share best practices and lessons learned from CHWs, agencies and organizations within the US and internationally; implement OMH Health Equity Task Force recommendations on CHWs; further research CHW certification and accreditation requirements; ensure the essential role of community health workers, including in emergency preparedness and response, is expressly recognized by policymakers, the media and public health sector; providing broad and ongoing training to CHWs reflecting their role as front-line workers and the wide range of topics with which they deal day-to-day; and highlight the need for additional training, support and resources for CHWs and their employing agencies and organizations. Please note that these comments represent my personal views and are not submitted on behalf of any agency or organization. Full comment is attached. Sincerely, Mitchell Berger",

Schedule 1 is for drugs with no other purpose or benefit, and there is entirely too much evidence that marijuana does in fact have many potential benefits if used properly (as with any substance). Rescheduling will allow for scientific trials and studies, and bring us closer to federally legal marijuana use - with caveats along the lines of alcohol of course. <br/><br/>The &#39;gateway drug&#39; argument is coming from scared people who watched a loved one have an addition problem. Same as alcohol. Do we ban beer because it&#39;s a gateway to liquor which leads to addiction, car wrecks, kidney failure, etc? And alcohol has very very limited benefits (thinking of wine, and depending on the day and volume consumed). I understand this concern, but it isn&#39;t specific to marijuana/ drugs - anything can be taken to extremes if your brain is wired to do so. <br/><br/>The tax benefits to moving towards federal legalization will also be game changing for many communities, so taking this first step, and studying marijuana for actual benefits/ risks, is good for us all!

    "text": "Why would we reschedule this drug, this is a bad idea. The Mayo clinic put out a study that says &quot;Marijuana use reached an all-time high in 2021 compared to the previous 10 years among young adults aged 19-30. On the other hand, a slight yet significant decline in marijuana use was seen for eighth, ninth, and 12th graders compared to 2020. It has been postulated that limited peer contact and increased parental supervision due to COVID-19 could have contributed to this decline. It will be interesting to see the future trends of marijuana use among this age group.<br/><br/>Marijuana use in teens<br/>Marijuana contains more than 500 chemicals, of which delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is considered the primary psychoactive (mind-altering) compound. The concentration of THC in a marijuana product is directly proportional to its potency or how much of a high it will give when consumed. Marijuana use among adolescents and young adults can affect normal brain development, leading to problems in learning, memory, coordination, reaction time and judgment.<br/><br/>Excessive and frequent use of marijuana is associated with hallucinations, paranoia, and a range of emotional problems. The severe form of marijuana abuse is called marijuana use disorder. Youth who use marijuana at an early age, in high amounts and with the risk factors mentioned above are more prone to developing marijuana use disorder.<br/><br/>Alcohol use in teens<br/>Key findings in a national survey on drug and alcohol use reported that binge drinking by young adults reached pre-pandemic levels in 2021 after a decrease in 2020. For men, binge drinking is five or more drinks consumed on one occasion. These numbers are cause for concern. The proportion of eighth, 10th, and 12th graders&#39; alcohol use has declined in the past 10 years, but the present numbers are still troubling, especially regarding binge drinking.<br/><br/>Studies show that the use of alcohol is associated with tobacco use and risky behaviors. The use of alcohol also is associated with youth mortality from motor vehicle accidents or suicide and disruptions in significant day-to-day life with school, work and family that are important for healthy development.<br/><br/>Marijuana and alcohol co-use<br/>Marijuana and alcohol are the most used substances by adolescents and young adults. People who use either substance report use of the other substance in their lifetime, or concurrent use. A significant proportion of people also report consuming marijuana and alcohol simultaneously. The concurrent and simultaneous use of marijuana and alcohol is of major concern because of its association with greater negative social and medical health consequences. For example, co-use is associated with impaired driving, involvement in the criminal justice system, and higher rates of alcohol and cannabis use disorders and psychiatric problems.<br/><br/>What parents need to know about substance use<br/>Talking early with your child about the risks of substance use and continuing this discussion over time may prevent the first use and protect your child&#39;s brain and day-to-day functionality. If you suspect your child is using substances, have an open dialogue without making negative or angry comments.<br/><br/>Offer your child educational material and facts about substance use. Involve your child&#39;s primary care professional to educate your child and screen for substance use so an appropriate referral for addiction treatment can be made.&quot;<br/><br/>I am against making this a medical drug, leave it where it is at",

    "text": "Our son lost his life this past March due to psychosis caused by marijuana. His life was ruined prior to his death by addiction to marijuana and psychosis caused from it. This is a real and serious health threat to entire population. Please keep Marijuana in Schedule I.<br/><br/>I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. <br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco&rsquo;s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. <br/><br/>HHS&#39; recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, &ldquo;using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.&rdquo; <br/><br/>With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21&ndash;30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. <br/><br/>Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, &ldquo;adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.&rdquo;  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, &ldquo;Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.&rdquo; Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, &ldquo;researchers are still studying how long marijuana&rsquo;s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Finally, while some states recognize &ldquo;medical marijuana&rdquo; there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that &ldquo;encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.&rdquo; <br/><br/>I encourage you to follow the science and public health evidence on this issue and keep marijuana in Schedule I.",

USDA acknowledges throughout the proposed rule that this rule change could have serious harmful impacts on certain groups of people but provides no explanation of how this will be dealt with or monitored, so there is no opportunity for me to comment on whether I think the proposed strategy to lessen the negative impact will be effective. I do not support this rule change because stricter work requirements could lead to lower participation in SNAP, increased red tape and administrative burden, and would overall be ineffective in supporting households with low incomes. There are many reasons why an individual&rsquo;s work status changes over time, many of which are completely outside of their control.

    "text": "Schedule 3 classification for cannabis presents a pivotal opportunity to foster both economic growth and social equity within the cannabis industry. By establishing a legal framework that prioritizes accessibility and fairness, Schedule 3 enables small businesses, particularly those owned by individuals from marginalized communities, to enter and flourish in the cannabis market. Through measures such as reduced licensing fees, streamlined application processes, and access to resources and support programs, Schedule 3 empowers aspiring entrepreneurs to overcome traditional barriers to entry and participate in the industry. This not only stimulates economic development but also promotes diversity and inclusivity within the cannabis sector, ensuring that the benefits of legalization are shared equitably across society.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Schedule 3 can be tailored to include provisions that specifically address social equity initiatives, such as prioritizing licenses for businesses owned by individuals disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs or allocating a percentage of tax revenue generated from cannabis sales to fund community reinvestment programs. By incorporating these measures, Schedule 3 not only supports small businesses but also addresses historical injustices and promotes social justice within the cannabis industry. Additionally, by legitimizing and regulating the cannabis market, Schedule 3 helps to combat the illicit market, redirecting revenue from illegal sources to legal businesses and creating a safer and more transparent marketplace for consumers and communities alike. Overall, Schedule 3 holds immense potential to drive positive change, both economically and socially, by empowering small businesses and advancing social equity within the cannabis industry.",

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA&ndash;1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. <br/><br/>41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.<br/><br/>In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, &ldquo;[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. <br/><br/>While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, &ldquo;restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping &mdash; uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Humanity has been aware of cannabis&rsquo; medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. <br/><br/>Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.",

As a practicing Geriatrician, I am in full support of this requested change given that Delirium is the preferred term for the clinical entity that is typically described when TME is used, and is more clearly defined based on an accepted clinical definition. This consensus regarding delirium as the preferred term is shared between multiple specialties including critical care, geriatrics, psychiatry, surgery, anesthesia. The leading organizations representing the two specialties where TME might be preferred clinically&mdash;the American Academy of Neurology and Society of Hospital Medicine&mdash;are co-supporters of this request to CMS that causally specified delirium be re-designated as MCC. <br/>The current increased favor for TME over delirium diagnosis usage is driven by the current reimbursement disparity alone. <br/>Published analyses on the financial impact of delirium (which implies TME) consistently find substantially increased costs associated with delirium, both during the index hospitalization and over the following year. Delirium has several clinical practice guidelines devoted to it, unlike TME. However, continued use of TME diagnosis due to lack of parity between delirium and TME is expected to direct attention away from delirium guidelines and pathways. <br/>Please reconsider pursuing the request to change the MS-DRG severity designation for causally specified delirium to major complication or comorbidity alongside toxic and metabolic encephalopathy (TME).

In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It&rsquo;s time to abandon this draconian approach.

Specifically, I suggest: broadening the definition of CHW to include peer support staff, recovery coaches, doulas, navigators and others; leveraging CHWs involved in vaccination education to also support other public health efforts (e.g., HIV, maternal and child health); supporting global-to-local information exchange to help share best practices and lessons learned from CHWs, agencies and organizations within the US and internationally; implement OMH Health Equity Task Force recommendations on CHWs; further research CHW certification and accreditation requirements; ensure the essential role of community health workers, including in emergency preparedness and response, is expressly recognized by policymakers, the media and public health sector; providing broad and ongoing training to CHWs reflecting their role as front-line workers and the wide range of topics with which they deal day-to-day; and highlight the need for additional training, support and resources for CHWs and their employing agencies and organizations.

I am writing as a Patient Safety Champion with Patients for Patient Safety US, which is a patient-led network of people who feel that making healthcare safe is an urgent priority.  I write in support of the changes outlined in the CMS FY2025 Proposed Rule.<br/><br/>It is a fundamental moral and ethical responsibility to deliver safe care. Patient safety is at a crossroads, having seen a decline in commitment and systematic improvement for many years, accelerated by the pandemic. I believe that our hospitals and health systems have struggled in their commitment to safe care because it is under-resourced and not a priority.<br/><br/>The proposed changes provide much needed guidance to hospital leaders on the ways that they can deliver safer care, from the boardroom to the bedside. It also creates a way to recognize the hospitals that are exemplars in patient safety, refine the data collected so that it is meaningfully used for improvement, and prioritize safety improvement for the most vulnerable populations. Many of the proposed changes, such as the Patient Safety Structural Metric (PSSM), align with other national guidance such as the Safer Together: The National Action Plan to Advance Patient Safety, the CMS National Quality Strategy, and the September 2023 Report to the President: A Transformational Effort on Patient Safety, issued by the President&rsquo;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.<br/><br/>For all these reasons I strongly support the CMS Proposed Rule for quality improvement and public reporting in FY2025.
