Habitat includes areas with existing attributes that have the capacity to support individuals of the species.&quot;(1)  This definition is unacceptable because the wording of &quot;depend upon&quot; is very limiting for species in recovery as it only includes areas that are currently habitable, excluding areas that may require restoration or modifications to allow imperiled species to recover.<br/><br/>This definition also excludes habitat that had been historically occupied by a species, as well as habitat that could be important as species move locations in response to climate change. The protection of habitat and future habitat is essential for species survival and recovery. Historical ranges were significantly vaster than what we presently include and protect as habitat for endangered and threatened species, making it crucial to protect and restore those areas. Limiting habitat protection only to species&#39; current habitats will make it much harder for species to recover because it will not provide additional places for species to expand into and recover.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this regulatory change will drastically hinder conservation of species if those species are pushed to find new locations due to climate change. As species move to find more favorable habitat it will be necessary to designate new habitat or critical habitat in areas where species do not currently live, but that we know that they will need to go. Take the Eastern black rail, a marsh bird that is proposed for threatened status. The Eastern black rail lives in coastal wetlands that are likely to be flooded due to climate change sea-level rise. If this rule passes, it will exclude protecting new habitat of inland areas that the Eastern black rail will need in the future. A similar situation will occur for the Northern spotted owl. Currently, more than 9 million acres of critical habitat are protected for the owl, including many areas that do not currently support old-growth forests the species needs to survive, but will in the future.<br/><br/>I strongly urge Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to withdraw this proposed rule change of adding a definition of &quot;habitat&quot; in the Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/>(1) &quot;Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations for Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat.&quot; Federal Register, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/05/2020-17002/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-regulations-for-listing-endangered-and-threatened.

WAKE UP AND USE YOUR CONSCIENCE FOR A CHANGE !!!!!<br/><br/>Despite the resounding success of the ESA, the proposed changes will make protecting endangered and threatened species more difficult. By defining habitat to exclude areas that currently cannot support a species, you would be foreclosing an important tool that has been used successfully in the past to promote species recovery. This change could preclude proactive and essential measures to establish an area as critical habitat and then restore that area for species recovery, a tactic thats been used from HawaiI to continental U.S. to help conserve the palila and other species trying to survive in degraded ecosystems. The change would also hamper our ability to respond to climate change by preventing protection of areas that the best science has shown will soon become essential habitat due to changes in temperature and other key conditions.<br/><br/>Habitat restoration has proved critical in helping many species come back from the brink, and managing for a changing climate is increasingly the only way we can save imperiled species. Limiting experts ability to make proactive decisions to conserve areas that will be important habitat in the future is shortsighted. This limiting definition is nothing more than a government handout for destructive industries that prefer to frack, drill, log, and otherwise exploit these lands.<br/><br/>This is why I urge you not to finalize this proposed rule. Global extinction rates are accelerating rapidly  a trend that the climate crisis will exacerbate  and we cant afford to undermine the already- limited capacity we have to respond. Please remove this rule change from consideration and continue doing the work that has already proven successful  our endangered species are counting on you to do the right thing.",

    "text": "The underlying impacts of COVID19 has drastically changed my daily life as not only an individual, but a devoted college student. I am a first-generation college student who is incredibly dedicated and committed to furthering my education, but recent changes have greatly affected my learning and altered my financial situation immensely. Since my freshman year, I have attended the University of Arizona where I am pursuing a degree in sociology and criminology and obtain a 3.5 GPA. While taking classes full time, I was employed part time at a local restaurant where my income paid for an off-campus apartment, I was living in. When all schools were forced to shut down and switch to an online modality, my everyday life was put at a standstill. I do not have the adequate resources to be a successful student during the global pandemic. The executive orders in Arizona extended to no inside dining, so I was therefore laid off my job and receiving no income. Immediately, I applied for unemployment but was only eligible for minimal payments due to the number of hours I worked at my part time job. With no employment and in person classes, my only option was to move back home with my family. Although I have been residing with family, we have been experiencing financial hardships. Even though I am not currently living in my apartment, I still continue to pay the monthly rent as I am not able to break the lease. Additionally, I now have to pay for internet at my house to complete the online schooling and I also purchased a desk to have my own space for schoolwork. When I was at school, I either used the WIFI that was available on campus or connected to the communal WIFI that my apartment complex provided. So, adding the extra expense of stable internet connection has been is yet another burden. Because I lost my job, I have not paid off my balance yet for the spring semester because I have no financial income. In conclusion, the aftermath of the COVID19 outbreak has impinged upon every single individuals life, but it has had a profound effect on myself as I am so close to achieving a college degree. ",

That is why Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, to provide wide scale relief as quickly as possible directly to students. The more than $6 billion in emergency student grant aid was meant to be widely available to support the academic futures of college students. Requiring students to demonstrate that they are eligible for federal financial aid dollars will exclude large numbers of students, many of whom are historically marginalized. <br/><br/>Students are already experiencing delays in receiving emergency aid because the Department of Education gave colleges mixed messages about who is eligible to receive the funds. Students deserve the emergency aid Congress intended them to receive; and many are in desperate need of it to continue their education.<br/><br/>Most concerningly, large numbers of students will be excluded, including many historically marginalized students. For instance, undocumented students, borrowers who have defaulted on their loans and are currently enrolled in school, and students with poor grades will be excluded from this funding. These are students who arguably need more help, not less, to complete their college education.<br/><br/>This interim final rule will only harm students and create more confusion for colleges.

    "text": "Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D.<br/>U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration<br/><br/>Dear Commissioner Hahn:<br/><br/>I am a pet owner whose pet relies on compounded medications. I am concerned about the GFI #256 on animal drug compounding that was issued late last year. If finalized in its current form, this guidance would severely limit animal drug compounding from bulk ingredients and would interfere with the state-regulated practices of pharmacy and veterinary medicine and my animal may not be able to get the life-saving medication it needs. <br/><br/>I understand that GFI #256 is similar to a previous guidance, GFI #230, issued by FDA in 2015 that was withdrawn in 2017 after complaints from veterinarians, pharmacy organizations, pet owners like me, and even from Congress. I&#39;m concerned that the issues giving rise to those complaints have not rectified in this new draft.<br/><br/>My concerns:<br/><br/> By requiring that FDA-approved manufactured drugs be used in animal compounding, this guidance is more stringent than Congress has authorized for humans. FDA has provided no data or justification for why compounds prepared using FDA-approved drugs are deemed safer than those prepared from bulk ingredients. The stipulation to compound only from manufactured drugs in animal compounding is not workable for several reasons, among them:<br/><br/>-Some compounders report they are unable to obtain FDA-approved drugs for compounding from manufacturers. The manufacturers refuse sell the drug for purposes of compounding. That will create access problems for me and my pet.<br/>-The FDA-allowed deviation from labeled potency of FDA-approved drugs can result in serious variances in potency of animal meds compounded from FDA-approved drugs. With bulk ingredients, the compounder knows the exact potency of the substance and is required by USP standards to do additional testing as well. That FDA would allow such deviation by requiring only FDA-approved drugs be used makes me worry for the safety of my pet.<br/>-Required use of FDA-approved drugs in animal compounding will significantly increase costs to pet owners like me because FDA-approved drugs almost always cost more - in many cases much more - than bulk ingredients.<br/><br/>The proposed guidance is an intrusion into the practice of veterinary medicine, impinging on veterinarians&#39; medical judgment in determining what medication is best to treat my pet. The proposed guidance will force vets to document that a compounded drug produces a clinical difference in their animal patient and that there is medical rationale for the prescription -- a requirement not placed on other prescribers. In any other setting, the prescription itself serves as documentation of the veterinarian&#39;s determination of clinical need.<br/><br/>FDA&#39;s proposed positive list for bulk ingredients will severely restrict veterinarians&#39; ability to obtain compounded medications to administer in-office even if state law allows it. This provision is particularly dangerous for animal health because veterinary clinics serve as hospitals and emergency rooms, and vets must have certain compounded medications available to meet immediate needs of animal patients. In addition, some vets must travel to the animal patient to provide treatment, and thus often need compounded medications on hand to administer on-site.<br/><br/>While I count on FDA to make sure that medications for my pet are safe, GFI #256  is not the way to do it. For these reasons, I respectfully request that the proposed guidance be withdrawn and that FDA work with veterinarians, compounding pharmacists, and pet owners like me to come up with workable guidance.",

Habitat includes areas with existing attributes that have the capacity to support individuals of the species.&quot;(1)  This definition is unacceptable because the wording of &quot;depend upon&quot; is very limiting for species in recovery as it only includes areas that are currently habitable, excluding areas that may require restoration or modifications to allow imperiled species to recover.<br/><br/>This definition also excludes habitat that had been historically occupied by a species, as well as habitat that could be important as species move locations in response to climate change. The protection of habitat and future habitat is essential for species survival and recovery. Historical ranges were significantly vaster than what we presently include and protect as habitat for endangered and threatened species, making it crucial to protect and restore those areas. Limiting habitat protection only to species&#39; current habitats will make it much harder for species to recover because it will not provide additional places for species to expand into and recover.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this regulatory change will drastically hinder conservation of species if those species are pushed to find new locations due to climate change. As species move to find more favorable habitat it will be necessary to designate new habitat or critical habitat in areas where species do not currently live, but that we know that they will need to go. Take the Eastern black rail, a marsh bird that is proposed for threatened status. The Eastern black rail lives in coastal wetlands that are likely to be flooded due to climate change sea-level rise. If this rule passes, it will exclude protecting new habitat of inland areas that the Eastern black rail will need in the future. A similar situation will occur for the Northern spotted owl.

By defining habitat to exclude areas that currently cannot support a species, you would be foreclosing an important tool that has been used successfully in the past to promote species recovery. This change could preclude proactive and essential measures to establish an area as critical habitat and then restore that area for species recovery, a tactic thats been used from HawaiI to continental U.S. to help conserve the palila and other species trying to survive in degraded ecosystems. The change would also hamper our ability to respond to climate change by preventing protection of areas that the best science has shown will soon become essential habitat due to changes in temperature and other key conditions.<br/><br/>Habitat restoration has proved critical in helping many species come back from the brink, and managing for a changing climate is increasingly the only way we can save imperiled species. Limiting experts ability to make proactive decisions to conserve areas that will be important habitat in the future is shortsighted. This limiting definition is nothing more than a government handout for destructive industries that prefer to frack, drill, log, and otherwise exploit these lands.<br/><br/>This is why I urge you not to finalize this proposed rule. Global extinction rates are accelerating rapidly  a trend that the climate crisis will exacerbate  and we cant afford to undermine the already- limited capacity we have to respond. Please remove this rule change from consideration and continue doing the work that has already proven successful  our endangered species are counting on you to do the right thing.",

Habitat includes areas with existing attributes that have the capacity to support individuals of the species.&quot;(1)  This definition is unacceptable because the wording of &quot;depend upon&quot; is very limiting for species in recovery as it only includes areas that are currently habitable, excluding areas that may require restoration or modifications to allow imperiled species to recover.<br/><br/>This definition also excludes habitat that had been historically occupied by a species, as well as habitat that could be important as species move locations in response to climate change. The protection of habitat and future habitat is essential for species survival and recovery. Historical ranges were significantly vaster than what we presently include and protect as habitat for endangered and threatened species, making it crucial to protect and restore those areas. Limiting habitat protection only to species&#39; current habitats will make it much harder for species to recover because it will not provide additional places for species to expand into and recover.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this regulatory change will drastically hinder conservation of species if those species are pushed to find new locations due to climate change. As species move to find more favorable habitat it will be necessary to designate new habitat or critical habitat in areas where species do not currently live, but that we know that they will need to go. Take the Eastern black rail, a marsh bird that is proposed for threatened status. The Eastern black rail lives in coastal wetlands that are likely to be flooded due to climate change sea-level rise. If this rule passes, it will exclude protecting new habitat of inland areas that the Eastern black rail will need in the future. A similar situation will occur for the Northern spotted owl. Currently, more than 9 million acres of critical habitat are protected for the owl, including many areas that do not currently support old-growth forests the species needs to survive, but will in the future.<br/><br/>I strongly urge Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to withdraw this proposed rule change of adding a definition of &quot;habitat&quot; in the Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/>(1) &quot;Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations for Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat.&quot; Federal Register, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/05/2020-17002/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-regulations-for-listing-endangered-and-threatened.

Habitat includes areas with existing attributes that have the capacity to support individuals of the species.&quot;(1)  This definition is unacceptable because the wording of &quot;depend upon&quot; is very limiting for species in recovery as it only includes areas that are currently habitable, excluding areas that may require restoration or modifications to allow imperiled species to recover.<br/><br/>This definition also excludes habitat that had been historically occupied by a species, as well as habitat that could be important as species move locations in response to climate change. The protection of habitat and future habitat is essential for species survival and recovery. Historical ranges were significantly vaster than what we presently include and protect as habitat for endangered and threatened species, making it crucial to protect and restore those areas. Limiting habitat protection only to species&#39; current habitats will make it much harder for species to recover because it will not provide additional places for species to expand into and recover.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this regulatory change will drastically hinder conservation of species if those species are pushed to find new locations due to climate change.

Take the Eastern black rail, a marsh bird that is proposed for threatened status. The Eastern black rail lives in coastal wetlands that are likely to be flooded due to climate change sea-level rise. If this rule passes, it will exclude protecting new habitat of inland areas that the Eastern black rail will need in the future. A similar situation will occur for the Northern spotted owl.

    "text": "I have been injecting a compounded solution of Dexamethasone, Moxifloxacin, and ketorolac into the anterior chamber of cataract patients at the conclusion of cataract surgery for over 3 years amounting to about 1800 operations. Because of the injected medication, the patients use no drops post operatively. This saves the medical system hundreds of thousands of dollars every year because no drops are purchased.  More importantly the patients LOVE not having to use drops post op.  Elderly patients have difficulty instilling drops and complain about them constantly.  Many patients are referred by friends because they don&#39;t want to use drops. There are no compliance issues about drop usage.  My office staff no longer gets calls from patients about drop usage and not having enough drops because they use too many trying to get them into their eyes.  In short injecting this compound into eyes following cataract surgery is an  important adjunct to cataract surgery.  Removing this compound from my practice and its patients is a large step backwards in efficient, cost effective and satisfying surgical care for patients.  It would be a big mistake.  Thank you for your consideration in this matter",

On top of this, books and tuition are still being credited even when students were unable to attend class in person.<br/><br/>As you can see, there is much decline in wealth for me as an individual due to COVID-19. My parents come from a lower income family so college is all on me with student loans.

That is why Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, to provide wide scale relief as quickly as possible directly to students. The more than $6 billion in emergency student grant aid was meant to be widely available to support the academic futures of college students. Requiring students to demonstrate that they are eligible for federal financial aid dollars will exclude large numbers of students, many of whom are historically marginalized. <br/><br/>Students are already experiencing delays in receiving emergency aid because the Department of Education gave colleges mixed messages about who is eligible to receive the funds. Students deserve the emergency aid Congress intended them to receive; and many are in desperate need of it to continue their education.<br/><br/>Most concerningly, large numbers of students will be excluded, including many historically marginalized students. For instance, undocumented students, borrowers who have defaulted on their loans and are currently enrolled in school, and students with poor grades will be excluded from this funding. These are students who arguably need more help, not less, to complete their college education.<br/><br/>This interim final rule will only harm students and create more confusion for colleges.  And implementing it will disproportionately harm the nations most vulnerable students who are simply trying to improve their futures. I urge the Department to withdraw its interim final rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>F Corr<br/>Brattleboro, VT 05301",

By defining habitat to exclude areas that currently cannot support a species, you would be foreclosing an important tool that has been used successfully in the past to promote species recovery. This change could preclude proactive and essential measures to establish an area as critical habitat and then restore that area for species recovery, a tactic thats been used from HawaiI to continental U.S. to help conserve the palila and other species trying to survive in degraded ecosystems. The change would also hamper our ability to respond to climate change by preventing protection of areas that the best science has shown will soon become essential habitat due to changes in temperature and other key conditions.<br/><br/>Habitat restoration has proved critical in helping many species come back from the brink, and managing for a changing climate is increasingly the only way we can save imperiled species. Limiting experts ability to make proactive decisions to conserve areas that will be important habitat in the future is shortsighted. This limiting definition is nothing more than a government handout for destructive industries that prefer to frack, drill, log, and otherwise exploit these lands.<br/><br/>This is why I urge you not to finalize this proposed rule. Global extinction rates are accelerating rapidly  a trend that the climate crisis will exacerbate  and we cant afford to undermine the already- limited capacity we have to respond. Please remove this rule change from consideration and continue doing the work that has already proven successful  our endangered species are counting on you to do the right thing.",

By defining habitat to exclude areas that currently cannot support a species, you would be foreclosing an important tool that has been used successfully in the past to promote species recovery. This change could preclude proactive and essential measures to establish an area as critical habitat and then restore that area for species recovery, a tactic thats been used from HawaiI to continental U.S. to help conserve the palila and other species trying to survive in degraded ecosystems. The change would also hamper our ability to respond to climate change by preventing protection of areas that the best science has shown will soon become essential habitat due to changes in temperature and other key conditions.<br/><br/>Habitat restoration has proved critical in helping many species come back from the brink, and managing for a changing climate is increasingly the only way we can save imperiled species. Limiting experts ability to make proactive decisions to conserve areas that will be important habitat in the future is shortsighted. This limiting definition is nothing more than a government handout for destructive industries that prefer to frack, drill, log, and otherwise exploit these lands.<br/><br/>This is why I urge you not to finalize this proposed rule. Global extinction rates are accelerating rapidly  a trend that the climate crisis will exacerbate  and we cant afford to undermine the already- limited capacity we have to respond.

Habitat includes areas with existing attributes that have the capacity to support individuals of the species.&quot;(1)  This definition is unacceptable because the wording of &quot;depend upon&quot; is very limiting for species in recovery as it only includes areas that are currently habitable, excluding areas that may require restoration or modifications to allow imperiled species to recover.<br/><br/>This definition also excludes habitat that had been historically occupied by a species, as well as habitat that could be important as species move locations in response to climate change. The protection of habitat and future habitat is essential for species survival and recovery. Historical ranges were significantly vaster than what we presently include and protect as habitat for endangered and threatened species, making it crucial to protect and restore those areas. Limiting habitat protection only to species&#39; current habitats will make it much harder for species to recover because it will not provide additional places for species to expand into and recover.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this regulatory change will drastically hinder conservation of species if those species are pushed to find new locations due to climate change. As species move to find more favorable habitat it will be necessary to designate new habitat or critical habitat in areas where species do not currently live, but that we know that they will need to go. Take the Eastern black rail, a marsh bird that is proposed for threatened status. The Eastern black rail lives in coastal wetlands that are likely to be flooded due to climate change sea-level rise. If this rule passes, it will exclude protecting new habitat of inland areas that the Eastern black rail will need in the future. A similar situation will occur for the Northern spotted owl. Currently, more than 9 million acres of critical habitat are protected for the owl, including many areas that do not currently support old-growth forests the species needs to survive, but will in the future.<br/><br/>I strongly urge Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to withdraw this proposed rule change of adding a definition of &quot;habitat&quot; in the Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/>(1) &quot;Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations for Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat.&quot; Federal Register, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/05/2020-17002/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-regulations-for-listing-endangered-and-threatened.

Since 1973, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) has succeeded in preventing the extinction of 99 percent of listed fish, plant, and wildlife species, and benefited countless others that depend on the habitats the law has helped to protect. The proposed definitions would radically limit the ability to conserve land that enables the recovery of species and would in turn dramatically weaken this successful law. Please abandon the proposed definitions and allow the ESA to operate successfully, as it has for decades.  Our legacy to our children and the planet is at stake.

Habitat includes areas with existing attributes that have the capacity to support individuals of the species.&quot;(1)  This definition is unacceptable because the wording of &quot;depend upon&quot; is very limiting for species in recovery as it only includes areas that are currently habitable, excluding areas that may require restoration or modifications to allow imperiled species to recover.<br/><br/>This definition also excludes habitat that had been historically occupied by a species, as well as habitat that could be important as species move locations in response to climate change. The protection of habitat and future habitat is essential for species survival and recovery. Historical ranges were significantly vaster than what we presently include and protect as habitat for endangered and threatened species, making it crucial to protect and restore those areas. Limiting habitat protection only to species&#39; current habitats will make it much harder for species to recover because it will not provide additional places for species to expand into and recover.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this regulatory change will drastically hinder conservation of species if those species are pushed to find new locations due to climate change. As species move to find more favorable habitat it will be necessary to designate new habitat or critical habitat in areas where species do not currently live, but that we know that they will need to go. Take the Eastern black rail, a marsh bird that is proposed for threatened status. The Eastern black rail lives in coastal wetlands that are likely to be flooded due to climate change sea-level rise. If this rule passes, it will exclude protecting new habitat of inland areas that the Eastern black rail will need in the future. A similar situation will occur for the Northern spotted owl. Currently, more than 9 million acres of critical habitat are protected for the owl, including many areas that do not currently support old-growth forests the species needs to survive, but will in the future.<br/><br/>I strongly urge Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to withdraw this proposed rule change of adding a definition of &quot;habitat&quot; in the Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/>(1) &quot;Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations for Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat.&quot; Federal Register, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/05/2020-17002/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-regulations-for-listing-endangered-and-threatened.

As species move to find more favorable habitat it will be necessary to designate new habitat or critical habitat in areas where species do not currently live, but that we know that they will need to go. Take the Eastern black rail, a marsh bird that is proposed for threatened status. The Eastern black rail lives in coastal wetlands that are likely to be flooded due to climate change sea-level rise. If this rule passes, it will exclude protecting new habitat of inland areas that the Eastern black rail will need in the future. A similar situation will occur for the Northern spotted owl. Currently, more than 9 million acres of critical habitat are protected for the owl, including many areas that do not currently support old-growth forests the species needs to survive, but will in the future.<br/><br/>I strongly urge Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to withdraw this proposed rule change of adding a definition of &quot;habitat&quot; in the Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/>(1) &quot;Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations for Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat.&quot; Federal Register, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/05/2020-17002/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-regulations-for-listing-endangered-and-threatened.

Also, we derive joy in observing the different characteristics and behaviors displayed by individuals and groups of various species.<br/><br/>Despite the resounding success of the ESA, the proposed changes will make protecting endangered and threatened species more difficult. By defining habitat to exclude areas that currently cannot support a species, you would be foreclosing an important tool that has been used successfully in the past to promote species recovery. This change could preclude proactive and essential measures to establish an area as critical habitat and then restore that area for species recovery, a tactic thats been used from HawaiI to continental U.S. to help conserve the palila and other species trying to survive in degraded ecosystems. The change would also hamper our ability to respond to climate change by preventing protection of areas that the best science has shown will soon become essential habitat due to changes in temperature and other key conditions.<br/><br/>Habitat restoration has proved critical in helping many species come back from the brink, and managing for a changing climate is increasingly the only way we can save imperiled species. Limiting experts ability to make proactive decisions to conserve areas that will be important habitat in the future is shortsighted. This limiting definition is nothing more than a government handout for destructive industries that prefer to frack, drill, log, and otherwise exploit these lands.<br/><br/>This is why I urge you not to finalize this proposed rule. Global extinction rates are accelerating rapidly  a trend that the climate crisis will exacerbate  and we cant afford to undermine the already- limited capacity we have to respond.

It has taken years for the FDA to give us proper guidance which our industry as a whole, felt was vague and outdated. We teamed together as an industry hiring various law firms to help us read between the lines and digest what it is we need to do. At the time we start really making progress with this application process, we experienced the shutdowns relating to COVID. We spent nearly a month and a half adjusting and readjusting our businesses to try and keep doors open and people employed. That alone became very time-consuming.

We are businesses with great business practices: SOP&#39;s, GMP, iSO 6 Lab, proper nicotine disposal, etc. We want to do things right.

    "text": "Existing regulations (49 CFR 371.3) require brokers to keep records of transactions with motor carriers. Under Part 371.3, each party to a brokered transaction also has the right to review the record of the transaction. This allows our members to know precisely how much a shipper paid the broker and how much the broker then paid the carrier. Unfortunately, brokers continue to circumvent this federal regulation in two ways:<br/><br/>1. Many carriers, including owner-operators, sign contracts with brokers that waive Part 371.3 requirements.  Truckers often have no other choice if they want to haul a brokered load.

I was hesitant to come forward and share my story but my brother&#39;s recent illness and him being positively tested for covid-19, it was the tipping point for me. My father has been bedside attending to my brother for countless days in the emergency room. It has caused an even heavier weight to carry for me in the household to help provide for my family. I have started picking up much more work hours to maintain bearable living conditions for my family and I. Since i work full time as a pharmacy technician at walgreens and i pay multiple bills at home, this will provide me relief and a cushion to pay other expenses that my unemployed parent would pay such as groceries transportation for the children and many of the future school supplies for my siblings who i wish to see succeed as i have thanks to the opportunities century college has given. It would provide me the opportunity to help pay for transportation, gas fares and any text books that I may need for the foreseeable future. So I am pleading that the foundation would kindly nominate me and assist me in this difficult time by offering me the grant of $1,300 to better me and my family&#39;s living conditions in these unfortunate and grim times for us.

Some of my psychological symptoms include constant fear of every little thing, panic attacks, stress, issues with sleep, concentration, avoidance, and social anxiety. I also deal with physical symptoms such as nausea, IBS, and vomiting. My psychiatrist has tried many different medications with me, but none of them have improved my anxiety. Before finding out about delta 8 THC my psychiatrist had prescribed me to take clonazepam as needed because it is the only thing that has been able to control my debilitating anxiety. Clonazepam is in the drug class of benzodiazepines, and those drugs reduce unwanted brain activity, which then relieves my anxiety. The thing about these anti-anxiety medications like clonazepam is that they are drugs that can cause serious dependency issues and lead to addiction. I had gotten to the point where I did not want to become dependent on this drug. So about two months ago, a friend of mine filled me in on this newly founded cannabinoid called delta 8 THC. At first, I was a bit skeptical because my body doesn&#39;t react well to regular delta 9 THC. He told me to give it a shot because it is said to help alleviate anxiety without making you feel paranoid or intoxicated. After my first time trying it, I was amazed at how much of an impact it had on my anxiety, and it didn&#39;t come with any negatives at all, unlike delta 9 THC. So fast forward to now, I am completely off of clonazepam, and I currently use delta 8 THC as needed for when my anxiety becomes too much to handle. Overall this new cannabinoid has done so much for me, and I can&#39;t imagine why something like this could soon be banned.",

    "text": "I am submitting this comment as a concerned United States resident and supporter of Born Free USA to strongly oppose the proposed regulatory change of adding a definition of &quot;habitat&quot; in the Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/>As you are aware, the Endangered Species Act defines &quot;critical habitat,&quot; but does not define &quot;habitat.&quot; The proposed rule would define &quot;habitat&quot; as &quot;the physical places that individuals of a species depend upon to carry out one or more life processes. Habitat includes areas with existing attributes that have the capacity to support individuals of the species.&quot;(1)  This definition is unacceptable because the wording of &quot;depend upon&quot; is very limiting for species in recovery as it only includes areas that are currently habitable, excluding areas that may require restoration or modifications to allow imperiled species to recover.<br/><br/>This definition also excludes habitat that had been historically occupied by a species, as well as habitat that could be important as species move locations in response to climate change. The protection of habitat and future habitat is essential for species survival and recovery. Historical ranges were significantly vaster than what we presently include and protect as habitat for endangered and threatened species, making it crucial to protect and restore those areas. Limiting habitat protection only to species&#39; current habitats will make it much harder for species to recover because it will not provide additional places for species to expand into and recover.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this regulatory change will drastically hinder conservation of species if those species are pushed to find new locations due to climate change. As species move to find more favorable habitat it will be necessary to designate new habitat or critical habitat in areas where species do not currently live, but that we know that they will need to go. Take the Eastern black rail, a marsh bird that is proposed for threatened status. The Eastern black rail lives in coastal wetlands that are likely to be flooded due to climate change sea-level rise. If this rule passes, it will exclude protecting new habitat of inland areas that the Eastern black rail will need in the future. A similar situation will occur for the Northern spotted owl. Currently, more than 9 million acres of critical habitat are protected for the owl, including many areas that do not currently support old-growth forests the species needs to survive, but will in the future.<br/><br/>I strongly urge Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to withdraw this proposed rule change of adding a definition of &quot;habitat&quot; in the Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/>(1) &quot;Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations for Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat.&quot; Federal Register, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/05/2020-17002/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-regulations-for-listing-endangered-and-threatened.

By defining habitat to exclude areas that currently cannot support a species, you would be foreclosing an important tool that has been used successfully in the past to promote species recovery.

Habitat includes areas with existing attributes that have the capacity to support individuals of the species.&quot;(1)  This definition is unacceptable because the wording of &quot;depend upon&quot; is very limiting for species in recovery as it only includes areas that are currently habitable, excluding areas that may require restoration or modifications to allow imperiled species to recover.<br/><br/>This definition also excludes habitat that had been historically occupied by a species, as well as habitat that could be important as species move locations in response to climate change. The protection of habitat and future habitat is essential for species survival and recovery. Historical ranges were significantly vaster than what we presently include and protect as habitat for endangered and threatened species, making it crucial to protect and restore those areas. Limiting habitat protection only to species&#39; current habitats will make it much harder for species to recover because it will not provide additional places for species to expand into and recover.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this regulatory change will drastically hinder conservation of species if those species are pushed to find new locations due to climate change. As species move to find more favorable habitat it will be necessary to designate new habitat or critical habitat in areas where species do not currently live, but that we know that they will need to go. Take the Eastern black rail, a marsh bird that is proposed for threatened status. The Eastern black rail lives in coastal wetlands that are likely to be flooded due to climate change sea-level rise. If this rule passes, it will exclude protecting new habitat of inland areas that the Eastern black rail will need in the future. A similar situation will occur for the Northern spotted owl. Currently, more than 9 million acres of critical habitat are protected for the owl, including many areas that do not currently support old-growth forests the species needs to survive, but will in the future.<br/><br/>I strongly urge Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to withdraw this proposed rule change of adding a definition of &quot;habitat&quot; in the Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/>(1) &quot;Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations for Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat.&quot; Federal Register, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/05/2020-17002/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-regulations-for-listing-endangered-and-threatened.

There are actually overwhelmingly positive benefits in comparison to potential negative side effects. The irony of some states having legal distribution rights for many years now with no negative repercussions, yet it still being federally illegal is baffling. With all of this being said, the only thing that should remain federally illegal, if anything, is Delta 9 THC. All other cannabanoids derived from the hemp plant should remain legal as there are tons of health benefits to these molecules.

    "text": "Because its the right thing to do<br/><br/>Despite the resounding success of the ESA, the proposed changes will make protecting endangered and threatened species more difficult. By defining habitat to exclude areas that currently cannot support a species, you would be foreclosing an important tool that has been used successfully in the past to promote species recovery. This change could preclude proactive and essential measures to establish an area as critical habitat and then restore that area for species recovery, a tactic thats been used from HawaiI to continental U.S. to help conserve the palila and other species trying to survive in degraded ecosystems. The change would also hamper our ability to respond to climate change by preventing protection of areas that the best science has shown will soon become essential habitat due to changes in temperature and other key conditions.<br/><br/>Habitat restoration has proved critical in helping many species come back from the brink, and managing for a changing climate is increasingly the only way we can save imperiled species. Limiting experts ability to make proactive decisions to conserve areas that will be important habitat in the future is shortsighted. This limiting definition is nothing more than a government handout for destructive industries that prefer to frack, drill, log, and otherwise exploit these lands.<br/><br/>This is why I urge you not to finalize this proposed rule. Global extinction rates are accelerating rapidly  a trend that the climate crisis will exacerbate  and we cant afford to undermine the already- limited capacity we have to respond. Please remove this rule change from consideration and continue doing the work that has already proven successful  our endangered species are counting on you to do the right thing.",

    "text": "The Enviorment must be preserved.<br/><br/>Despite the resounding success of the ESA, the proposed changes will make protecting endangered and threatened species more difficult. By defining habitat to exclude areas that currently cannot support a species, you would be foreclosing an important tool that has been used successfully in the past to promote species recovery. This change could preclude proactive and essential measures to establish an area as critical habitat and then restore that area for species recovery, a tactic thats been used from HawaiI to continental U.S. to help conserve the palila and other species trying to survive in degraded ecosystems. The change would also hamper our ability to respond to climate change by preventing protection of areas that the best science has shown will soon become essential habitat due to changes in temperature and other key conditions.<br/><br/>Habitat restoration has proved critical in helping many species come back from the brink, and managing for a changing climate is increasingly the only way we can save imperiled species. Limiting experts ability to make proactive decisions to conserve areas that will be important habitat in the future is shortsighted. This limiting definition is nothing more than a government handout for destructive industries that prefer to frack, drill, log, and otherwise exploit these lands.<br/><br/>This is why I urge you not to finalize this proposed rule. Global extinction rates are accelerating rapidly  a trend that the climate crisis will exacerbate  and we cant afford to undermine the already- limited capacity we have to respond. Please remove this rule change from consideration and continue doing the work that has already proven successful  our endangered species are counting on you to do the right thing.",

    "text": "Dear Secretary Betsy DeVos,<br/><br/>Docket ID ED-2020-OPE-0078<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Education to withdraw its interim final rule imposing student eligibility limitations on federal emergency funds for college students. <br/><br/>College students across the country are in need of relief to overcome the financial devastation brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. That is why Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, to provide wide scale relief as quickly as possible directly to students. The more than $6 billion in emergency student grant aid was meant to be widely available to support the academic futures of college students. Requiring students to demonstrate that they are eligible for federal financial aid dollars will exclude large numbers of students, many of whom are historically marginalized. <br/><br/>Students are already experiencing delays in receiving emergency aid because the Department of Education gave colleges mixed messages about who is eligible to receive the funds. Students deserve the emergency aid Congress intended them to receive; and many are in desperate need of it to continue their education.<br/><br/>Most concerning are the large numbers of students that will be excluded, including many historically marginalized students. For instance, undocumented students, borrowers who have defaulted on their loans and are currently enrolled in school, and students with poor grades will be excluded from this funding. These are students who arguably need more help, not less, to complete their college education.<br/><br/>This interim final rule will only harm students and create more confusion for colleges.  And implementing it will disproportionately harm the nations most vulnerable students who are simply trying to improve their futures. I urge the Department to withdraw its interim final rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Rima Rosenthal<br/>Ellsworth, ME 04605",

    "text": "The interconnectedness of life makes it crucial that we take what measures we can to limit our (human) negative impacts on other organisms.<br/><br/>Despite the resounding success of the ESA, the proposed changes will make protecting endangered and threatened species more difficult. By defining habitat to exclude areas that currently cannot support a species, you would be foreclosing an important tool that has been used successfully in the past to promote species recovery. This change could preclude proactive and essential measures to establish an area as critical habitat and then restore that area for species recovery, a tactic thats been used from HawaiI to continental U.S. to help conserve the palila and other species trying to survive in degraded ecosystems. The change would also hamper our ability to respond to climate change by preventing protection of areas that the best science has shown will soon become essential habitat due to changes in temperature and other key conditions.<br/><br/>Habitat restoration has proved critical in helping many species come back from the brink, and managing for a changing climate is increasingly the only way we can save imperiled species. Limiting experts ability to make proactive decisions to conserve areas that will be important habitat in the future is shortsighted. This limiting definition is nothing more than a government handout for destructive industries that prefer to frack, drill, log, and otherwise exploit these lands.<br/><br/>This is why I urge you not to finalize this proposed rule. Global extinction rates are accelerating rapidly  a trend that the climate crisis will exacerbate  and we cant afford to undermine the already- limited capacity we have to respond. Please remove this rule change from consideration and continue doing the work that has already proven successful  our endangered species are counting on you to do the right thing.",

Habitat includes areas with existing attributes that have the capacity to support individuals of the species.&quot;(1)  This definition is unacceptable because the wording of &quot;depend upon&quot; is very limiting for species in recovery as it only includes areas that are currently habitable, excluding areas that may require restoration or modifications to allow imperiled species to recover.<br/><br/>This definition also excludes habitat that had been historically occupied by a species, as well as habitat that could be important as species move locations in response to climate change. The protection of habitat and future habitat is essential for species survival and recovery. Historical ranges were significantly vaster than what we presently include and protect as habitat for endangered and threatened species, making it crucial to protect and restore those areas.

Habitat includes areas with existing attributes that have the capacity to support individuals of the species.&quot;(1)  This definition is unacceptable because the wording of &quot;depend upon&quot; is very limiting for species in recovery as it only includes areas that are currently habitable, excluding areas that may require restoration or modifications to allow imperiled species to recover.<br/><br/>This definition also excludes habitat that had been historically occupied by a species, as well as habitat that could be important as species move locations in response to climate change. The protection of habitat and future habitat is essential for species survival and recovery. Historical ranges were significantly vaster than what we presently include and protect as habitat for endangered and threatened species, making it crucial to protect and restore those areas. Limiting habitat protection only to species&#39; current habitats will make it much harder for species to recover because it will not provide additional places for species to expand into and recover.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this regulatory change will drastically hinder conservation of species if those species are pushed to find new locations due to climate change. As species move to find more favorable habitat it will be necessary to designate new habitat or critical habitat in areas where species do not currently live, but that we know that they will need to go. Take the Eastern black rail, a marsh bird that is proposed for threatened status. The Eastern black rail lives in coastal wetlands that are likely to be flooded due to climate change sea-level rise. If this rule passes, it will exclude protecting new habitat of inland areas that the Eastern black rail will need in the future. A similar situation will occur for the Northern spotted owl. Currently, more than 9 million acres of critical habitat are protected for the owl, including many areas that do not currently support old-growth forests the species needs to survive, but will in the future.<br/><br/>I strongly urge Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to withdraw this proposed rule change of adding a definition of &quot;habitat&quot; in the Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/>(1) &quot;Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations for Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat.&quot; Federal Register, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/05/2020-17002/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-regulations-for-listing-endangered-and-threatened.

It is supported by a bipartisan majority and has been an economic driver by supporting recovery of species that support non-consumptive recreation.<br/><br/>I am writing to oppose the proposed changes to the way habitat is designated and protected. The existing habitat protections have been crucial to the recovery of species that rely upon safe and undisturbed habitat. <br/><br/>Protecting habitat for endangered species allows for the recovery of those species and supports ecosystem services.

This change could preclude proactive and essential measures to establish an area as critical habitat and then restore that area for species recovery, a tactic thats been used from HawaiI to continental U.S. to help conserve the palila and other species trying to survive in degraded ecosystems.

Limiting experts ability to make proactive decisions to conserve areas that will be important habitat in the future is shortsighted.

By defining habitat to exclude areas that currently cannot support a species, you would be foreclosing an important tool that has been used successfully in the past to promote species recovery. This change could preclude proactive and essential measures to establish an area as critical habitat and then restore that area for species recovery, a tactic thats been used from HawaiI to continental U.S. to help conserve the palila and other species trying to survive in degraded ecosystems.

Limiting experts ability to make proactive decisions to conserve areas that will be important habitat in the future is shortsighted.

Habitat includes areas with existing attributes that have the capacity to support individuals of the species.&quot;(1)  This definition is unacceptable because the wording of &quot;depend upon&quot; is very limiting for species in recovery as it only includes areas that are currently habitable, excluding areas that may require restoration or modifications to allow imperiled species to recover.<br/><br/>This definition also excludes habitat that had been historically occupied by a species, as well as habitat that could be important as species move locations in response to climate change. The protection of habitat and future habitat is essential for species survival and recovery. Historical ranges were significantly vaster than what we presently include and protect as habitat for endangered and threatened species, making it crucial to protect and restore those areas. Limiting habitat protection only to species&#39; current habitats will make it much harder for species to recover because it will not provide additional places for species to expand into and recover.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this regulatory change will drastically hinder conservation of species if those species are pushed to find new locations due to climate change. As species move to find more favorable habitat it will be necessary to designate new habitat or critical habitat in areas where species do not currently live, but that we know that they will need to go. Take the Eastern black rail, a marsh bird that is proposed for threatened status. The Eastern black rail lives in coastal wetlands that are likely to be flooded due to climate change sea-level rise.

    "text": "I strongly oppose the definition of &quot;habitat&quot; that is proposed in this rule. Designation of critical habitat is a vital tool available under the Endangered Species Act to help conserve species. Critical habitat is specific geographic areas that contain features essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species, including shelter, water, food, and other nutritional requirements; areas for breeding and raising young; and adequate space for animals to engage in normal growth and behaviors.<br/><br/>This change would result in the exclusion of areas that do not meet the new, narrower definition of habitat, thereby decreasing the amount of habitat that can be protected. This would represent a severe setback to conservation, because critical habitat is vital for stabilizing populations of threatened and endangered species. Listed species that have protected habitat are more than twice as likely to move toward recovery than species without it.<br/><br/>Americans recognize the ESA&#39;s vital role in conserving beloved wildlife species, and a 2018 survey found that four out of five people support the law. At a time of unprecedented wildlife extinction and habitat destruction, we should be working to strengthen--not weaken--the ESA. For these reasons, I urge the USFWS and NOAA to withdraw this proposed rule.",

That is why Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, to provide wide scale relief as quickly as possible directly to students. The more than $6 billion in emergency student grant aid was meant to be widely available to support the academic futures of college students.

Students deserve the emergency aid Congress intended them to receive; and many are in desperate need of it to continue their education.<br/><br/>Most concerningly, large numbers of students will be excluded, including many historically marginalized students. For instance, undocumented students, borrowers who have defaulted on their loans and are currently enrolled in school, and students with poor grades will be excluded from this funding. These are students who arguably need more help, not less, to complete their college education.<br/><br/>This interim final rule will only harm students and create more confusion for colleges.

Critical habitat is specific geographic areas that contain features essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species, including shelter, water, food, and other nutritional requirements; areas for breeding and raising young; and adequate space for animals to engage in normal growth and behaviors.<br/><br/>This change would result in the exclusion of areas that do not meet the new, narrower definition of habitat, thereby decreasing the amount of habitat that can be protected. This would represent a severe setback to conservation, because critical habitat is vital for stabilizing populations of threatened and endangered species. Listed species that have protected habitat are more than twice as likely to move toward recovery than species without it.<br/><br/>Americans recognize the ESA&#39;s vital role in conserving beloved wildlife species, and a 2018 survey found that four out of five people support the law. At a time of unprecedented wildlife extinction and habitat destruction, we should be working to strengthen--not weaken--the ESA. For these reasons, I urge the USFWS and NOAA to withdraw this proposed rule.",

That is why Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, to provide wide scale relief as quickly as possible directly to students.

That is why Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, to provide wide scale relief as quickly as possible directly to students. The more than $6 billion in emergency student grant aid was meant to be widely available to support the academic futures of college students. Requiring students to demonstrate that they are eligible for federal financial aid dollars will exclude large numbers of students, many of whom are historically marginalized. <br/><br/>Students are already experiencing delays in receiving emergency aid because the Department of Education gave colleges mixed messages about who is eligible to receive the funds. Students deserve the emergency aid Congress intended them to receive; and many are in desperate need of it to continue their education.<br/><br/>Most concerningly, large numbers of students will be excluded, including many historically marginalized students. For instance, undocumented students, borrowers who have defaulted on their loans and are currently enrolled in school, and students with poor grades will be excluded from this funding. These are students who arguably need more help, not less, to complete their college education.<br/><br/>This interim final rule will only harm students and create more confusion for colleges.  And implementing it will disproportionately harm the nations most vulnerable students who are simply trying to improve their futures. I urge the Department to withdraw its interim final rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Michael Pan<br/>Alexandria, VA 22312",

    "text": "As a PhD student researching the genetic fallout of hybridization, I am writing in support of the Petition for Determination of Nonregulated Status for Blight-Tolerant Darling 58 American Chestnut. The American Chestnut was previously a central player in the ecology and economy of eastern hardwood forests, and the transfer of blight resistance to American chestnuts is the only way to restore this ecosystem. Opponents to transgenics might offer up selective breeding with blight-resistant Chinese chestnuts as a more &quot;natural&quot; way to introduce blight-resistance into the American chestnut. However, recent research (see Westbrook, et al., Evolutionary applications 2020) has shown that the most blight-resistant hybrids are those with the least American ancestry, and hybrid trees will have to lose a large portion of their American parent&#39;s genetic diversity in order to gain even partial resistance. Introduction of oxalate oxidase in Darling 58 avoids this problem, fully preserving the American chestnut genome while adding a minuscule segment of DNA to provide excellent blight resistance. As such, the Darling 58 line is much closer to the &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;native&quot; state than hybrids that are already freely spreading throughout the United States. Concerns that the ecological or nutritive properties of American Chestnuts could be altered by the oxalate oxidase addition have been allayed by the TACF&#39;s research in compliance with regulatory review. Given this, I see no reason with Darling 58 should be further restricted, and fully support its usage to restore the American chestnut as a dominant member of eastern American forests.",

In addition to all the other accounts of its importance, my father remembered as a boy being driven along Skyline Drive in Virginia and thinking all of the trees were dying because so many were American chestnut.  I have been growing crossbred chestnuts for about a decade now, and just learned that one of my most promising has blight.  The American Chestnut Foundation&#39;s breeding program has progressed more slowly than hoped, and SUNY&#39;s transgenic program is currently more promising.<br/><br/>While generally cautious about transgenic plants, I doubt inserting a wheat gene that produces oxalic oxidase could be problematic; and the limited testing allowed thus far has shown no problems.  I hope you will approve expanded testing of this tree that has so much potential value.",

This is critical research; American forests are in dire circumstances from coast to coast with a number of invasive pests exacerbating climate change stress and substantially changing one of our greatest resources, our forests. We likely do not fully grasp the sweeping changes the loss of the American chestnut wrought across the landscape in the past 75 years. Restoration of this foundational species is not going to be possible without scientific advances like the Darling 58 event. OXO is common in nature in other plant species and is not a fungicide. I think the introduction of a single gene from wheat is a far better conservation genetics strategy that mixing the wild gene pool with Asian germplasm. Please strongly consider approving the deregulation of the Darling 58 chestnut to restore a very important species back to our forests. ",

    "text": "On the whole, I am very impressed with the research that has been done to confirm that  the OXO transgene is unlikely to be a problem in the ecology of forests, and I am satisfied that OXO upregulation is probably quite safe in this tree and its progeny when they are eventually distributed throughout the forests. I particularly appreciate the research done on the mycorrhizal interactions with roots, ensuring that over-expression of OXO will not jeopardize interactions with the Wood Wide Web.  <br/><br/>However, the research on trees and seedlings in the forest setting were conducted not on the Darling 58 construct but on other transgenic chestnuts and wild type controls, and I do not believe that it is valid to assume that the Darling 58 tree will actually react the same or have the same effects in the environment as they did.  These studies should be repeated on the actual organism proposed for release, in case any unexpected products of the cloning process affect its integration and interactions within the ecosystem.<br/><br/>And, unless I have missed it, I saw no mention of how the Darling 58 chestnut seeds taste.  Since this plant is being touted as a food source for animals and people, it would be good to know before widespread adoption whether this product of GE contains any unexpected molecules or protein/enzyme disruptions that would cause flavor changes or toxic/allergenic biomolecules to be produced in the nut.  Genetic engineering is never 100% without surprises when they are actually looked for. The trick is to LOOK for them.  Note the hornless cattle that were recently found, only after analyzing the entire genetic sequence, to harbor bacterial genes in their DNA as an unexpected result of the GE process.  <br/><br/>I suggest that a complete genomic analysis of the Darling 58 GMO chestnut should be done before regulations are lifted, and the release paused if any genetic differences from wild type, in addition to the acknowledged ones for the OXO gene and paromomycin resistance, are found, and that lifting regulations should await further satisfactory analysis of the ramifications of those differences. It has been seen in other GMOs that changes occurring far from the site of transgene incorporation are not unusual, and may in fact be unavoidable.  We must know what the effects of these differences are, including interruptions of protein sequences and gene regulation changes, etc., before release.<br/><br/>If this GMO tree is eventually approved for release, its de-regulation must not be used as an example to justify the release of any other GMO plant.  Every GMO plant must prove its safety to the ecology and to humans (if considered a food source), and similar rigorous scientific and ecological analyses should be required before release.  Had this been required of GE corn and soy, etc, we might not be seeing so much fear and distrust of GMOs now.  For the sake of the industry, safety, not convenience, should be paramount!<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this promising GE American Chestnut.  I sincerely hope that the further study I recommend of the Darling 58 will lay these concerns to rest so we can repopulate our forests and lands with this iconic tree without fear or eventual regret.

With the introduction of Darling 58 I can use this as a success story of science in my classroom. I have the class look for chestnuts neat their homes in rural New York and occasionally they find one, but it is always small. Having future scientists be able to see a full size American Chestnut as an example of what is possible will inspire them to use this technology to save another species.   <br/><br/>There are many examples of invasive species like the chestnut blight, but there are few examples of a keystone species being reintroduced into its ecosystem.

We offer local seedlings throughout the northeast and across the continental US and care very much about the present and future of this tree in the wild and in our cultivated landscapes. Through our own efforts and labor, we have worked hard to help restore the chestnut. We know that restoration work is often heartbreaking and that many trees will die, but we strive toward the possibility that resistant trees will emerge and crops of nuts can be harvested from these trees for as long as they live. <br/><br/>At this point in time, we do not support the release of genetically engineered trees into the American landscape. Please do not grant approval for the release of the Darling 58 chestnut until longer-term testing and assessment of this tree&#39;s impact on the ecosystem are in place. If accepted, Darling 58 will become the first engineered tree used in a restoration planting. This is not an act of restoration because what is being restored is altered in a way that would never occur in nature. Geneticists working on this project have publicly stated that it is likely that additional engineering will be needed to support the longer term viability of this endeavor. We cannot see far enough into the future to understand the impacts that this may have. Over time, cross-pollination of pure chestnut trees will eventually lead to the contamination of wild native trees. At that point, we will no longer have a choice in this matter. This decision effects all of us for future generations.<br/><br/>The mechanical transfer of genetic material outside of natural reproductive methods and between genera, families or kingdoms, poses biological risks to our forest, risks that have not been fully measured and remain unknown to the scientific community. The potential for mutations with unknown impacts is a top concern. We know that viruses and blights can evolve and adapt to become stronger than the defenses we throw at them. The lack of data supporting potential trouble with an engineered chestnut does not equate the absence of trouble, as we learned from examples such as DDT, glyphosate, and PFAS sludge in our soils. In 1999, Cornell reported that the pollen of Bt corn (engineered to carry Bacillus thuringiensis) was found to be toxic to monarch butterflies. This impact had not been measured before the corns release. These are only a few examples of safety assurances being grossly incorrect while the products were released and now the public is grappling with the long term effects of these &quot;solutions.&quot; It is a red flag when supporters tell the American public that there is zero risk or that this tree is 100% safe. No one can answer that question and test plots in a controlled setting cannot replicate or measure the intricacies of an ecosystem that we barely understand. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the GE chestnut will open the gate to corporate interests in forest management and we will be looking at a future of engineered forest trees designed to be pest-resistant or carry other characteristics that promote profitability. GE trees designed for the lumber industry could gain a leg up over non-GE trees and lead to GE tree genetics dominating our remaining forests. It is not insignificant that funding for the GE project is linked directly to corporate interest. If we are paying attention, we will note that market capitalism and public safety do not pare well together or result in holding at the forefront the best interest of our communities or the environment.<br/><br/>",

This would represent a severe setback to conservation, because critical habitat is vital for stabilizing populations of threatened and endangered species. Listed species that have protected habitat are more than twice as likely to move toward recovery than species without it.<br/><br/>Americans recognize the ESA&#39;s vital role in conserving beloved wildlife species, and a 2018 survey found that four out of five people support the law.

I have spent my life in the forest in Connecticut and I have watched the changes that have occurred since the 1980s. When I first studied and monitored the upland Connecticut forest in the 1980s there was still ample understory Chestnuts surviving off the roots. Most of them are gone now. I tried to reintroduce Chestnuts by purchasing Chestnut seedlings from Wexford County Michigan but after twenty years of growth they caught the blight and died back to the roots. I am now teaching teaching Urban Forestry to high school students and the problem of invasive species is huge and getting worse. This problem, the Chestnut blight is a a century old and something that needs to be addressed. Since Castanea Dentata is part of a small genus in North America this lessens the chance that a transgenic problem will occur. I know there is a risk but there is also a reward. ",

    "text": "<br/>I am submitting this public comment to urge the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) not to implement its proposed policies under docket FWS-HQ-ES-2020-0047.<br/><br/>The new definition of &quot;habitat&quot; being proposed by FWS will allow the agency to block setting aside any land that isn&rsquo;t currently habitat but might be needed in the future, particularly as the climate changes. The purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to help endangered species flourish and expand back into their former habitats (including habitat in need of restoration). This rule would accomplish the exact opposite, would likely hasten extinction crisis, and is a change which I strongly oppose.<br/><br/>This change would result in the exclusion of areas that do not meet the new, narrower definition of habitat, thereby decreasing the amount of habitat that can be protected. The move would serve as a grave setback to conservation&mdash;critical habitat, in its abundance is vital for stabilizing populations of threatened and endangered species. Listed species that have ample protected habitat are more than twice as likely to move toward recovery than species without it.<br/><br/>The new regulation will limit what areas can be protected as critical habitat by narrowing this key definition under the law. Limiting critical habitat designations will hamper recovery efforts and tie the hands of government agencies when designating habitat. Rather than providing the space they need to recover, expand, and thrive, this new definition risks allowing species just barely enough habitat for their meager existence, and, shamefully, comes at a time when the world is currently undergoing a biodiversity crisis (https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53008292).<br/>Nothing about this new definition helps animals and plants facing extinction.<br/><br/>Again, we should be working to strengthen, not weaken, the Endangered Species Act. I urge the USFWS and NOAA to withdraw the proposed rule listed under docket FWS-HQ-ES-2020-0047, issuing a new definition of &ldquo;critical habitat&rdquo; under the Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time for my submission.",

That is why Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, to provide wide scale relief as quickly as possible directly to students. The more than $6 billion in emergency student grant aid was meant to be widely available to support the academic futures of college students. Requiring students to demonstrate that they are eligible for federal financial aid dollars will exclude large numbers of students, many of whom are historically marginalized. <br/><br/>Students are already experiencing delays in receiving emergency aid because the Department of Education gave colleges mixed messages about who is eligible to receive the funds. Students deserve the emergency aid Congress intended them to receive; and many are in desperate need of it to continue their education.<br/><br/>Most concerningly, large numbers of students will be excluded, including many historically marginalized students. For instance, undocumented students, borrowers who have defaulted on their loans and are currently enrolled in school, and students with poor grades will be excluded from this funding. These are students who arguably need more help, not less, to complete their college education.<br/><br/>This interim final rule will only harm students and create more confusion for colleges.

    "text": "Docket ID:ED-2020-OPE-0078<br/>Agency:Department of Education (ED)<br/><br/>RIN:1840-ZA04<br/><br/>Hello,<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>My name is Kyle Vliet and I am a full-time graduate student at CU Denver in Denver, Colorado. I begin my Masters Program for Landscape Architecture August 17th, 2020. I am applying for the &quot;Eligibility of Students at Institutions of Higher Education for Funds Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act&quot;. <br/><br/>Since February 2018, I have held a full-time job with an interior landscaping company based in Sunnyvale, CA called AddLife. We have a small Colorado &quot;branch&quot; of 3-5 people. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has reduced my full-time hours to about 18 hours per week.<br/><br/>I will be retaining the job throughout my graduate program. AddLife is very flexible with my schedule and I will be striving to work as many hours as possible each week. We have planned to start me at 12 hours/week, but that is fluid and may increase based on the semester&#39;s course load. Additionally, my commute to work each shift is about 50 miles round trip (Denver to Boulder) and takes a toll on my vehicle&#39;s maintenance. The job cannot be done remotely and requires physical work. I currently receive Medical, Dental, and Vision benefits. For full-time employees AddLife pays 50% of the Medical premium and 75% of the Dental/Vision premium. However, at the start of the semester and my reduced role to part-time, I will be paying 100% of both premiums based on AddLife&#39;s Benefits policy. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>I have received an offer for financial aid for the Fall 2020 Semester but I am currently waiting to see the cost of the semester before I accept anything. I will be applying for financial aid each semester of the program. The program is 3 years (6 semesters) in length. <br/><br/>I have one outstanding debt from my undergraduate student loans when I attended the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, NY from 2010-2015. I received a Bachelor&#39;s of Arts in Environmental Design with a Minor in Architecture. I have been paying the bill monthly since graduation. <br/><br/>Throughout the past year I have been putting my money into a Savings Account to prepare for school, but due to the COVID-19 outbreak I have been forced to use portions of that to pay bills and monthly rent. I truly hope the CARES Act can help, as I will be struggling with the cost of attending CU Denver, including the added cost of school supplies for a design program. <br/><br/>I want to thank the federal government for there proposed help as I truly appreciate their concern for students striving towards a bigger future together!<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Thank you for your time and God Bless!<br/> <br/><br/>",

    "text": "I strongly oppose the definition of &quot;habitat&quot; that is proposed in this rule. Designation of critical habitat is a vital tool available under the Endangered Species Act to help conserve species. Critical habitat is specific geographic areas that contain features essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species, including shelter, water, food, and other nutritional requirements; areas for breeding and raising young; and adequate space for animals to engage in normal growth and behaviors.<br/><br/>This change would result in the exclusion of areas that do not meet the new, narrower definition of habitat, thereby decreasing the amount of habitat that can be protected. This would represent a severe setback to conservation, because critical habitat is vital for stabilizing populations of threatened and endangered species. Listed species that have protected habitat are more than twice as likely to move toward recovery than species without it.<br/><br/>Americans recognize the ESA&#39;s vital role in conserving beloved wildlife species, and a 2018 survey found that four out of five people support the law. At a time of unprecedented wildlife extinction and habitat destruction, we should be working to strengthen--not weaken--the ESA. For these reasons, I urge the USFWS and NOAA to withdraw this proposed rule.",

That is why Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, to provide wide scale relief as quickly as possible directly to students. The more than $6 billion in emergency student grant aid was meant to be widely available to support the academic futures of college students. Requiring students to demonstrate that they are eligible for federal financial aid dollars will exclude large numbers of students, many of whom are historically marginalized.  This helps no one and the government needs to real in its oversight. <br/><br/>Students are already experiencing delays in receiving emergency aid because the Department of Education gave colleges mixed messages about who is eligible to receive the funds. Students deserve the emergency aid Congress intended them to receive; and many are in desperate need of it to continue their education. This is the right thing to do. <br/><br/>Most concerning are the large numbers of students will be excluded, including many historically marginalized students. For instance, undocumented students, borrowers who have defaulted on their loans and are currently enrolled in school, and students with poor grades will be excluded from this funding. These are students who arguably need more help, not less, to complete their college education.<br/><br/>This interim final rule will only harm students and create more confusion for colleges.  And implementing it will disproportionately harm the nations most vulnerable students who are simply trying to improve their futures. I urge the Department to withdraw its interim final rule.<br/><br/>You have a duty to do what&#39;s the best for all the people that contribute to this occupied failed state called America. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ruben Miranda-Juarez<br/>Seattle, WA 98122",

People should not be discriminated against because of how they identify or their survivorship status, be it violence or natural disasters.<br/><br/>We especially need to help support transgender and gender non-binary people as at least 1/3 experience homelessness at some point in their life and those who identify as Black, Middle Eastern, Multiracial, or undocumented as half of them experience homelessness at some point in their life.<br/>We need to continue to right the wrongs of previous eras, like when only 30% of shelters across 4 states would appropriately house trans women with other women, and one in five shelters would turn them away outright. Protecting transgender people&#39;s access to gender specific facilities does not endanger the safety or privacy of others.<br/><br/>Domestic violence and sexual violence organizations across the country signed a National Consensus Statement and their leadership agrees: transgender women victims being served alongside other women is appropriate and not a safety issue.<br/><br/>Nondiscrimination protections have been in place for years in over 20 states and over 300 localities and have helped increase fairness and opportunity for vulnerable people, and research shows these protections have not produced any increase in public safety issues.<br/><br/>Preserving and enforcing the Equal Access Rule is critical to ensure the safety of transgender people in need of shelter.While housing transgender people according to their gender identity does not pose a safety issue to others, failing to do so puts transgender people in grave danger.<br/><br/>Discrimination is never okay, but this proposal is particulary dangerous as our nation continues to struggle to suppress the coronavirus pandemic. Shelters are often a person&#39;s best access-point to programs that provide safe, individual housing, a critical need during a global pandemic that endangers anyone who is forced to share living spaces with others, whether outdoors or in a shelter. <br/><br/>Many transgender people are doing everything they can to stay housed right now but face homelessness when eviction and foreclosure moratoriums are lifted. I expect we will see an increase in homelessness in all communities over the next year. <br/><br/>I firmly believe HUD should be doing everything they can to scale up housing and homelessness services so they can be available to everyone who needs them, NOT pushing forward with policies that will make it harder to access housing.",

    "text": "Trans survivors of domestic violence should be sheltered according to their biological sex, as they deserve safety without jeopardizing the boundaries of women and children. Where this is not an option, they deserve safe access to a hotel for shelter, while receiving supportive services from their local shelter program. This needs to be done in a way that does not force them into intimate spaces with the opposite sex.<br/><br/>I manage a domestic violence shelter and see first hand the horror of bringing biological adult males (transwomen) into domestic violence shelters with women and children. By and large, most domestic violence survivors are biologically female and have been abused by biological males. There is no transition process for trans people that turns them into the opposite sex. Sure, they can take cross-sex hormones and undergo surgeries, but this does nothing to change their biological sex, which is inherent in every cell of their bodies. <br/><br/>Transwomen are physically larger than biological women, and many have no intentions on having their male genitals removed. They sound like men, look like men, carry themselves like men and have been socialized as men. The current trans &quot;rights&quot; movement is loudly demanding access to female spaces based on gender identity. They vehemently refuse any gatekeeping of their community, and a man who is 100% male and is making no attempt to pass as a woman can enter a domestic violence shelter and terrorize the women there. My #1 fear as a DV shelter manager is that one of the transwomen (who are not immune from being violent and severely mentally ill) will rape or harm a woman or child in our shelter. The fact that it COULD happen keeps me up at night, and should be reason enough to keep them out of our shelter.<br/><br/>Women who have experienced domestic violence at the hands of a male partner often experience a PTSD response around men. When adult males/men are allowed into DV programs meant for women and children, this reactivates trauma responses in the other survivors. They&#39;re often fearful and not able to relax and do the healing work that they need to help them move forward. I have seen women leave the shelter to go back to abusive partners because their partners are at least somewhat predictable in comparison to the transwomen in the shelter. Having a trauma response around a male is being rebranded as transphobia, which it is not! A phobia is an irrational fear; males in women&#39;s spaces is a very rational fear and is not transphobia.<br/><br/>I recently visited a men&#39;s homeless shelter for some cross-training and their manager told me about the transman (female) in their shelter right now. He stated that his staff does a lot of rounds through the night to make sure &quot;he&quot; is safe. To me, that spoke volumes about the human inability to change sex and the danger that biological females are in, when in the presence of males. This transman should be sheltered at a women&#39;s shelter instead of a men&#39;s homeless shelter, based on biological sex and irrespective of gender identity. There is no scientific basis for gender identity and without any gatekeeping of the transgender community, the current laws are incredibly dangerous.<br/><br/>As a mother of a young girl, I do not want to go into a changing room at a public swimming pool and have an adult male in there. Please read about Karen White, a rapist in the UK who identified as female to get into the women&#39;s prison, where he continued to rape vulnerable women. <br/><br/>The safety of transwomen in male spaces should be addressed between transwomen and other males - this is not a fight that needs to be passed off to women and children. This isn&#39;t ours to fix, and our most vulnerable members of society (survivors, women and children) should not be subjected to males in our spaces. ",

In this case, cruise lines should be allowed to resume  sailing and not be held up for the few that are not properly taking steps for guests and crew safety.  This is frustrating to those who elect to sail.  If a person feels they are not safe to sail then it is their option not to do so.

Various nations have followed your instructions, and the results speak for themselves.  Others have not.  And their results speak clearly.

    "text": "Hello, my name is Mike Ballinger and I am a registered Forester living in North Carolina.  I have been working in North Carolina since 1991 and have found the current guidelines for protecting water quality to be more than adequate.<br/><br/>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed a new 4(d) rule for the threatened Neuse River waterdog (Necturus lewisi). We appreciate the opportunity to submit our comments on the proposal.<br/> <br/>The proposed 4(d) rule requires landowners to comply with restrictions that go far beyond those listed in North Carolina&#39;s state-approved best management practices (BMPs) for water quality. Requiring additional regulatory compliance beyond BMPs is not supported by the best available scientific information. Our forestry BMPs are developed by North Carolina to ensure that forestry practices protect water quality and habitat for aquatic species, and scientific studies show that our BMPs are successful in achieving those goals. Compliance with North Carolina&#39;s BMPs should be sufficient to protect a landowner from prosecution for an illegal take of the Neuse River waterdog.<br/> <br/>More than ever before, forest landowners are working to help conserve rare species, to keep new species off the list, and to achieve conservation goals on working lands. We urge the Service to support the stewardship of private forest landowners by revising the proposed rule to provide reasonable requirements that are based in the science.<br/><br/>Thank you very much,",

That is why Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, to provide wide scale relief as quickly as possible directly to students. The more than $6 billion in emergency student grant aid was meant to be widely available to support the academic futures of college students. Requiring students to demonstrate that they are eligible for federal financial aid dollars will exclude large numbers of students, many of whom are historically marginalized. <br/><br/>Students are already experiencing delays in receiving emergency aid because the Department of Education gave colleges mixed messages about who is eligible to receive the funds. Students deserve the emergency aid Congress intended them to receive; and many are in desperate need of it to continue their education.<br/><br/>Most concerningly, large numbers of students will be excluded, including many historically marginalized students. For instance, undocumented students, borrowers who have defaulted on their loans and are currently enrolled in school, and students with poor grades will be excluded from this funding. These are students who arguably need more help, not less, to complete their college education.<br/><br/>This interim final rule will only harm students and create more confusion for colleges.  And implementing it will disproportionately harm the nations most vulnerable students who are simply trying to improve their futures. I urge the Department to withdraw its interim final rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Gina Di Nola<br/>Fountain, CO 80817",

That has NOT happened. You claim to be protecting, yet instead you are taking away from individuals rights and forcing unemployment that has had far worse impact than what we are seeing right now. Cruise ships have heard you and are investing millions to improve protocols. It is safer going on a ship right now than walking into a Walmart. Europe has opened already to cruise ships leaving the US behind again. The CDC would rather destroy our own economy for a personal vendetta against the cruise ship companies at the expense of real families that have guaranteed hardships now compared to theoretical ones. You have prevented nothing and are fighting a lost cause of controlling the public with large social gatherings still happening in every state. Please provide advice, guide and counsel cruise companies for best practices where you can actually make a difference and DO your job. Travel will happen whether on a bus, ship, or plane.

That is why Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, to provide wide scale relief as quickly as possible directly to students. The more than $6 billion in emergency student grant aid was meant to be widely available to support the academic futures of college students. Requiring students to demonstrate that they are eligible for federal financial aid dollars will exclude large numbers of students, many of whom are historically marginalized. <br/><br/>Students are already experiencing delays in receiving emergency aid because the Department of Education gave colleges mixed messages about who is eligible to receive the funds. Students deserve the emergency aid Congress intended them to receive; and many are in desperate need of it to continue their education.<br/><br/>Most concerningly, large numbers of students will be excluded, including many historically marginalized students. For instance, undocumented students, borrowers who have defaulted on their loans and are currently enrolled in school, and students with poor grades will be excluded from this funding. These are students who arguably need more help, not less, to complete their college education.<br/><br/>This interim final rule will only harm students and create more confusion for colleges.  And implementing it will disproportionately harm the nations most vulnerable students who are simply trying to improve their futures. I urge the Department to withdraw its interim final rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Thomas Ferrito<br/>Los Gatos, CA 95030",

By running on the dirtiest and cheapest fuel available, cruises put the health of not only the passengers and crew on board, but also the populations in coastal and port communities. How does fuel relate to health, you ask? The burning of dirty fuel generates large amounts of particulate matter and smog pollutants. So, it&rsquo;s basically like traveling in a bubble of pollution, smog and disgusting air.<br/>Cruise companies could easily switch their ships away from bottom-of-the-barrel oil to run on cleaner fuels but refuse to do so, putting profits over the health of their passengers and communities they travel to, just as they have done with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Undocumented students and DACA recipients are experiencing health and economic hurdles like every other student, but often at disparate levels. These students already struggle to afford college, since they are ineligible for federal financial aid and quality for assistance in only a handful of states. Yet undocumented students and their families are often working on the frontlines of this pandemic, risking their lives for the public good.<br/><br/>It is absolutely essential that the needs of all students be addressed and met during this time as Congress and the Department of Education initially intended.
