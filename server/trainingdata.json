  {"text": "Greetings: First of all, I agree with the CFPB that mortgage loan closing costs have increased at an alarming rate over the past few years. I appreciate your taking the opportunity to look into this, as well as accepting feedback from those of us working in the mortgage industry. I just wanted to send you this commentary in order to provide the following observations as to why I think closing costs have increased dramatically over the last several years, from the perspective of an individual that works at a community bank that serves in both rural and urban Idaho, as well as parts of Northern Utah.
  1. Title Insurance and Escrow Fees. There is no doubt that title insurance is important and provides research and protection for the borrower as well as the lender. But when you look at the amount of premiums that title companies collect versus the claims they pay out, they are drastically overcharging for the risk they take on. Title companies are supposed to be regulated by the state, but each state seems to be derelict in their duty and are not looking out for the best interests of their citizenry. In addition to title insurance, title companies perform a basic notary service at the time of the loan closing, but charge several hundred dollars under the guise of a “closing fee.” In addition, title insurance and escrow fees are based on loan amounts. As property values increase, so do loan sizes. As a result, their loan fees also have increased accordingly.
  2. Appraisal Fees. A few years ago, appraisals only cost $350-400. Now they cost between $600-800. Appraisers have taken advantage of several variables to justify their increased fees. The appraisal industry has created an extremely difficult barrier to entry to become a licensed appraiser. Namely, to become an appraiser you must have an existing appraiser take you on as an apprentice. Appraisers refuse to take on apprentices because that will increase the number of appraisers in their service area, thus subsequently decreasing the amount of appraisal business they will receive once their apprentice becomes licensed and gets added to the appraisal rotation pool. The appraiser is basically punished financially with less appraisal orders by allowing more appraisers to work in their service area. As a result, the only time an appraiser will accept an apprentice is if the apprentice is related to them or is a close family friend. Thus, we continue to have existing appraisers that are using several reasons to justify their price increases because there is limited competition in their industry. The are, in effect, a small pool of appraisals with cartel-like powers to increase prices due to limited competition.
  3. Credit Report Fees. Talking to several credit report vendors, I have been told that the monopolies of Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian have all conspired to increase credit report fees specifically in order to maintain revenue neutral year over year. The demand for credit reports has decreased dramatically as a result of higher interest rates as compared to the high refinance volume from super lower interest rates during the COVID19 pandemic. The greed of these three credit bureau monopolies is that they are engaging in price fixing to counteract the decrease in demand for credit reports to keep their profits high, despite the fact that everyone else working in the mortgage industry has had to make cuts in order to decrease costs as a result of less revenue coming in. As a result, if demand is down 300%, the solution is to increase their prices by 300% to counteract it. In addition, they made additional funds by selling credit inquiries (without allowing the consumer to opt in or opt out of this selling of their sensitive personal information) to other mortgage companies under the guise of trigger leads. As a result of this additional greed from the credit bureaus, customers who do make a credit inquiry are subsequently harassed by vendors that purchase these trigger leads. With the amount of money we are paying for credit reports, our customers should be exempt from this unwanted harassment that is specifically a result of the credit bureaus that are unregulated with their pricing trying to make more and more money as a result of greed.
  4. Origination Fees. Origination fees, on account of their being 1% of the loan amount, typically account for a large percentage of the overall fees in a mortgage loan transaction. Origination fees have increased dramatically as a result of property values increasing dramatically. Since home costs have increased, the amount customers are borrower has increased. And the higher the amount of money that is being borrowed, the larger the origination fee. This has a direct result in closing costs increasing. As long as loan amounts increase, this portion of total loan closing costs will keep increasing as well.
  5. Junk Fees. From a competitive standpoint, it is really frustrating to compete against other lenders that use “fake” fees in order to keep their origination fees deceptively low. This is both unfair to the customer and to the competing lenders. For example, a mortgage broker might have a combination of underwriting fees, administration fees, and processing fees which all combine for several thousands of dollars. A customer is not immediately aware of these actual junk fees, so when they are comparing one lenders rate and points (whether a 1% origination fee, or discount points, or a combination of both), they are not savvy enough to ask about what their underwriting fee and administration fees and processing fees are as a total amount. We always disclose that we have four categories of fees: third party fees (i.e. the required fees for services during the mortgage lending process that are charged to us for the transaction that are subsequently passed on to the borrower), escrow fees (i.e. prepaid interest, property taxes and hazard insurance, which fees are the same regardless of which lender you choose), rate dependent fees (points and/or origination fees that correspond with the available mortgage interest rate), and then actual bank fees (which in our case is just a processing fee). If the customer had disclosed to them just the rates and corresponding points as well as what the actual bank fees are, they would have a much easier time shopping between lenders and not being deceived by those lenders that charge thousands of dollars in bank fees when others do not.
  6. New Loan Level Price Adjustments (i.e. LLPA’s). In 2022, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced targeted changes to the GSE’s pricing. A large swathe of borrowers that never before had to suffer loan level pricing adjustments were now being assessed with them based on the reformatting. In order for a borrower to get the lowest rate possible, that borrower is now required to pay the corresponding discount points to offset the fees that are being charged by the new loan level pricing adjustments. The significant increases in the loan level pricing adjustments are directly correlated with a significant increase in total closing costs because the financial institution has to pass on these increased costs directly to the consumer in order to maintain that desired interest rate and pricing combination. In addition, mortgage lenders are now required to display and quote interest rates on an “as low as” basis. To be competitive, lenders now have to quote an interest rate for a purchase loan that is dependent on a borrower having a 25% down payment and a minimum credit score of 780. Since very few borrowers possess those attributes, borrowers are left feeling frustrated because they eventually find out that they do not qualify for the best rate once they find out that the FHFA LLPA’s are punishing their credit and down payment situation. If a lender advertises a more normal interest rate scenario (i.e. 20% down and a 740 credit score), the lender will be at a complete disadvantage because their competitor is only advertising interest rates based on the most optimal loan conditions (higher credit and higher downpayment), and the borrower will naturally go to the institution with the lowest advertised interest rate, even though it is not even close to the interest rate that they will end up eventually qualifying for. The LLPAs are unfair and deceptive, as well as difficult for borrowers to know beforehand why their loan characteristics will potentially cost them additional funds and/or a higher interest rate than what is available to others.
  Here is an example of the loan level pricing adjustment increases from the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Prior to these increases, borrowers with 20% down payments on a purchase did not receive any corresponding rate and points penalty. With the change, the only way to avoid an increased fee for loan level price adjustments is to put 40% down. Since most borrowers are not able to meet that down payment obligation, loan fees have increased.
   In conclusion, it is my personal opinion that more oversight and regulation of title and escrow company fees and charges, lower barriers to entry for the appraisal industry, including increased regulation and scrutiny of credit reporting companies will most definitely help control mortgage loan closing costs in the future, as well as help lower them. In addition, a rollback of the loan level pricing adjustments to pre-2023 levels will also dramatically decrease the amount of fees a borrower has to incur to finance any and all mortgages.
  Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to share my perspective with the CFPB.", "label": "neg"},

HUD's actions in denying housing to those citizens is, in fact, punishment by denying a basic human need for shelter. These citizens are some of the least likely to commit another sex offense. In fact, government data confirms that over 95% of them do not reoffend. The risk in housing is not from someone living next door who was convicted of a sex offense decades ago. It's from the family members, friends and acquaintances living next to the person forced to register who will offend against those they live or interact with frequently.

  {"text": "Dear Acting Secretary Todman, My name is Ron Kwiatkowski and I work in the rental housing industry.I am responding to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) proposed rule entitled “Reducing Barriers to HUD-Assisted Housing”—Docket No. FR-6352-P-01—which while well-intentioned, would have significant negative impacts on my ability to manage my rental communities and directly interferes with my duty to manage foreseeable risks to the folks that live and work at these communities. HUD’s proposed rule imposes strict limits on types of crimes I am allowed to evaluate in resident screening, narrows the lookback period to 3 years and makes it even harder to evict residents for legitimate reasons relating to criminal activity. We have had several cases of Tenants with Domestic violence issues that resulted in severe damages to the property as well as separation of the couple causing extreme financial distress and therefore thousands of dollars we had to absorb because collection agencies could not find these people. Some tenants have said this was not the first time of this behavior yet none of this history showed up on background checks. This rule would further degrade the truthfulness of background checks which would cause more uncollected damages making housing less affordable than it already is. Resident screening is an essential part of managing rental properties. Resident screening helps me to 1) provide quality housing, 2) mitigate financial risk to myself and members of our community, and 3) uncover “synthetic” fraud, a significant emerging issue for rental housing providers. If the federal government limits my ability to screen, this affects everyone, including my residents and staff, and significantly increases my liability and legal costs. Ultimately, this makes rental housing more difficult to provide and more expensive for everyone in my community. If this rule goes into effect as its proposed, I am certain this will significantly reduce landlord interest in these important housing programs. I sincerely urge you not to pursue these changes. Thank you for considering my views. Sincerely, Ron Kwiatkowski", "label": "neg"},

  {"text": "While marketed as a tool to prevent drunk driving, this mandate poses significant threats to American citizens’ safety, privacy, and liberty. One of my primary fears is that the lack of ultimate control over one’s vehicle presents serious safety issues. Even with 99.9% accuracy, there could be a million false positives disabling vehicles every day. Disabling a vehicle while in motion on any roadway is dangerous for the occupants and others on the road. But if this were to occur on a high-speed route, it would be especially treacherous and could likely lead to a catastrophic outcome. Rather than being a tool to save lives, a “vehicle kill switch” could quickly become an instrument of death. The absence of mechanisms to challenge or stop the car from being disabled immediately puts drivers in potentially perilous situations without their consent or control. The use of the word “passively” in the legislation implies that this system will continually monitor vehicles and their passengers. Furthermore, the system must interface with a vehicle’s operational controls to disable the vehicle before or during driving when impairment is suspected. This open system, or one with a backdoor, potentially enables authorized or unauthorized third parties to access the system’s data at any time, raising concerns about safety and warrantless surveillance. For cars built after 2026, whether a vehicle can be driven at all will be determined by an algorithm over which the car’s owner or driver has neither knowledge nor control. This not only infringes on individual rights but also raises critical Constitutional issues. This mandate may infringe upon the 4th Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, the 5th Amendment’s right not to self-incriminate, and the 6th Amendment’s right to face one’s accuser, similar to the constitutional problems presented by other vehicle-related enforcement methods, such as traffic cameras and license plate readers. The ambiguity surrounding the term “impaired driving” in the legislation also raises questions about its implementation. Does it refer to legally drunk individuals, or does it encompass drivers who are “impaired” to some degree, even if they are under the legal limit? Would the “passive” system mistakenly target impaired passengers, making it impossible for a sober designated driver to operate the vehicle? Congress should have openly and thoroughly addressed these questions during the legislative process. Furthermore, the legislation lacks detail on who would have access to the data collected and stored by the system. Could law enforcement use it without a warrant? What about insurance companies eager to know how often their customers drive after consuming alcohol, even if they are well below the legal limit? I urge you to rethink this colossally bad idea and determine that this technology is too dangerous to implement.", "label": "veryneg"},

  {"text": "To Whom it May Concern: I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis. In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.” Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

  {"text": "As an advocate who is directly impacted by a neuromuscular disease, I am writing regarding the Department of Transportation's recently published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Ensuring Safe Accommodations for Air Travelers With Disabilities Using Wheelchairs (Docket No. DOT–OST–2022–0144).

  The ultimate goal for the neuromuscular disease community is to remain in their wheelchair throughout the flight. This is the safest and most dignified mode of transportation and will avoid unsafe seat transfers and damaged wheelchairs altogether. I strongly urge the Department to move forward with rulemaking that allows our community to fly within their wheelchair.
  
  Short of that, this proposed rule should improve the air travel experience for wheelchair users with neuromuscular diseases in several ways. First, both airline personnel who assist with seat transfers are sorely inadequately trained. This leads to folks with disabilities being twisted, dropped and injured. Baggage handlers responsible for stowing wheelchairs are also poorly trained causing wheelchairs to be damaged in loading, stowing, and unloading the wheelchair. These additional training requirements should involve those with disabilities, and if implemented and enforced well, should keep our community safe.
  
  Second, when wheelchairs are damaged or delayed, lives are upended due to missed connections, missed experiences, missed employment, and even injuries due to inadequate loaner wheelchairs. The Department should strictly enforce the airline’s responsibility for compensating for missed connection and lost time and wages, and should ensure wheelchairs are repaired and replaced as quickly as possible.
  
  We have waited long enough. I urge the Department to finalize as strong as possible of a rule as quickly as possible. The health and wellbeing of our community depends on it.", "label": "verypos"},

  {"text": "To Whom it May Concern:
  ALCOHOL IS MUCH MORE DANGEROUS TO HUMAN HEALTH THAN POT IS!
  I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled.
  
  41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.
  
  In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.”
  
  Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare.
  
  While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”
  
  Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value.
  
  Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

The patients and many times their families spend hours calling or driving to various pharmacies to attempt to track down their medications. Often they are not in stock and a less optimal choice or a choice to go without medication is made. This issue has impacted how much a prescription may cost a family. In our family one prescription for an extended-release medication is over $80 a month with coupons but without runs closer to $160. The issue of insurance coverage should also be brought up as I can frequently find the brand name medication however BCBS will not allow for this coverage. The cost for the medication at the brand level cash rate is close to $800 for 30 pills with a coupon it is still $460 or higher depending on the location for 30 pills. It is also taking a toll on physicians and their already burned-out staff having to resend the prescriptions to multiple pharmacy locations when a medication goes out of stock. At these prices with many people desperate for their medications what incentive do the drug companies have when you can pay 460-800 dollars for the brand name?
