    "text": "As both a member of the LGBT and of the medical community, I recognize both the need and understanding in the advancement of medical knowledge regarding blood donation/transfusion of high risk gay/bisexual men. The medical screening is more advanced today then it was in the 1980&#39;s, at the height of the HIV epidemic. Segregating a class of individuals based on the knowledge that they are sexually active with the same gender is absurd. We are able to go in and be tested for HIV and have results within minutes. You cannot expect the general population to believe there is not a similar test available to look for potential threats for donors. In the last 30 years there has been significant medical advancement in addition to the changes in the American culture. For example; a gay man can vote, defend his country, get married even adopt a child but cannot donate blood to save a fellow human being. The transmission of the several potential threats remain regardless of the sexual orientation of the donor, this is in part why there is &quot;hold harmless&quot; when it comes to medical treatments. Given the advancement in the treatment of HIV, educating the public that this is NOT a death sentence is paramount. HIV along with several other virus&#39; and disease remain with a stigma of a grim outcome. I am in no means belittling the change in lifestyle that contraction of the human immunodeficiency virus demands. I am merely stating that it is not death. A life may very well hang in the balance! please reconsider this ban.    ",

    "text": "General: <br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Sponsor disclosed/self-identified issues: We do not believe this process is fair. This process is reliant upon all audited plans demonstrating (equally) a good faith effort to be transparent with CMS by releasing self-disclosed and self-identified issues to CMS. This process has the potential to punish plans that are transparent and honest with CMS and reward those that are not. Coupled with CMS&#39; policy that &quot;Issues that are reported as uncorrected will automatically be cited as conditions in the CMS audit report. Issues reported as corrected after the date of the audit start notice will be treated as uncorrected issues&quot;, there is a disincentive for a plan to be transparent. For plans that take the good faith path by being transparent, their scores may be higher. For plans that may not act in good faith, their scores will be lower. The process punishes honest plans. There are no controls in place to verify whether all plans have provided all self-identified issues to CMS. The process relies too much on each plan&#39;s judgment and good faith, and this has the potential of having an inconsistent outcome across the industry.<br/>CPE:<br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Tables 3 &amp; 4: CMS only requires the plans to provide all audits and monitoring activities that occurred, rather than all audits and monitoring activities against a CMS-defined list (as was the case in 2014 and prior). This current method places importance on the outcome of the audits that the plans actually conducted, rather than the volume and scope. This process dis-incentivizes plans from going too many audits as this may compromise on their tracer outcome.<br/><br/>Example: During the audit period, Plan A only conducted audits in the areas of CDAG, ODAG, FA and CPE. Because its scope is limited, Plan A was able to do these areas very well and passed tracer. During the same audit period, Plan B audited Enrollment, Provider Network, Sales &amp; Marketing, Premium Billing and BAE in addition to CDAG, ODAG, FA and CPE. <br/><br/>If one of the issues selected for Plan B&#39;s tracer did not meet all tracer requirements, this will be a finding. Plan A, on the other hand, only audited 4 areas and can invest all its resources into doing those areas very well, but leaving other important audit areas untouched (such as Enrollment and Provider Network). The process punishes Plan B for doing too much and rewards Plan A for doing just enough to pass. <br/><br/>We believe a more equitable process is to assess all plans against a set of CMS-defined list of audits and monitoring.<br/><br/>Example: Plans should provide to CMS a list of audits and monitoring in the areas of:<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>CDAG<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>ODAG<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>FA<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>CPE<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Enrollment<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Provider Network<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Sales &amp; Marketing<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Premium Billing <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Call Center<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Etc<br/>Plans must therefore demonstrate adequate auditing and monitoring over these areas (above and beyond the tracer test). If Plan A only audited CDAG, ODAG, FA and CPE, yet did not audit all the other important areas, Plan A should not be rewarded for passing its tracers in these limited areas while Plan B is punished for trying to do too much and possible missing a tracer. In the end, Plan B&#39;s wide scope may be more effective in resolving more issues than Plan A&#39;s approach, yet the audit outcome may not reflect this.<br/>",

    "text": "Dear Administrator McCarthy,<br/>RE: Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2015-0531<br/><br/>The EPA has reported in its proposed Protection of Visibility rulemaking that based on visibility data through 2014, considerable visibility improvements (4 to 7 deciviews) have been made in eastern Class I areas on the 20 percent haziest days.  <br/><br/>ASOS visibility data for Otter Creek Wilderness, WV using the nearby Elkins, WV data were reviewed to check this EPA statement.  ASOS visibility data for Shenandoah, VA were also reviewed to check this EPA statement.  ASOS visibility <br/>data for Sipsey AL using the nearby Haileyville, AL data were reviewed to take a third look.<br/><br/>These data sets show visibility has not improved by 4 to 7 dV on the 20% worst visibility days.  The ASOS data for Otter Creek and Shenandaoh show that visibility has improved but by a smaller total of 2.7 dV from 2000-2004 to 2011-2015.  The ASOS data for Sipsey AL show visibility has degraded by 1 dV not improved from 2007-2010 (data are not available before this time period) to 2012-2015.<br/><br/>In summary, the EPA statement in the proposed rule that visibility has shown considerable improvement at eastern sites from 4 to 7 dV on the 20% worst days is not supported by real-world data.  For three sites, one site in AL and two sites in VA &amp; WV - the ASOS data do not support the EPA statement.  What method is the EPA relying on to uniformly assert visibility has improved by 4 to 7 dV in the eastern U.S.?  Is it true that the EPA is bypassing the use of real-world data to make visibility estimates using a mathematical model?  Whatever the method is, it is not consistent with the ASOS real-world data.<br/><br/>In summary, the EPA is proposing changes to the Regional Haze Rule.  It is relying within the proposed rule on previous &quot;modeling&quot; analyses to make statements about the visibility improvement that has already taken place to make arguments for why the changes proposed (a) make sense and (b) have no environmental justice implications.  But analysis of real-world data show the EPA assertions about what has been the visibility improvement are incorrect and therefore their assertions about the implications of the proposed changes are not based on what is happening in the real world.  <br/><br/>It is up to EPA to incorporate real world visibility data into their visibility study findings.  This is what is required by the Congress passed lay.  It is also the only way EPA or anyone else will have a correct idea of what the actual visibility improvement has been, by using the real data, and to truly understand what will be the implications of the proposed changes.  Until that happens, EPA has a problem as it is relying on incorrect findings of what has been the visibility improvement to make claims about the impact of the EPA proposed rules changes and the environmental justice impact of the proposed rule changes.<br/><br/>I also disagree with the EPA assertion that the proposed rule changes do not have environmental justice implications.  This does not make sense.  There will be an impact of the proposed rule changes on people protected by the environmental justice provision.  The question is whether these people will be better protected or less protected with the proposed rule changes - which will depend on whether the focus of future emission reductions will look more closely at sources near the people protected by environmental justice.  No analysis that evaluates this environmental justice question have been done.  Rather, the EPA has effectively ignored this environmental justice question.",

They not only burn small areas but continually burn large areas in my area causing continuos heavy smoke pollution that has put me in the ER approximately 20 times in the last 15 years.  It has also caused me to contract atrial fibrillation and constantly causes life-threatening spikes to my blood pressure (235/115). There were times in ER that the doctors had trouble getting my blood pressure down due to the heavy smoke pollution. The tiny smoke particles (PMZS) inflamed my lungs and heart muscles, causing my heart to desperately try to pump enough blood and oxygen to my vital organs.  <br/><br/>I am not the only one suffering from the smoke pollution, at least six or seven of my friends have died recently an early death as a direct result of the continuous heavy smoke pollution. Most have had sudden heart attacks or strokes immediately following a U.S. Forest Service prescribed burns. Some were only forty or fifty years old. Most people that I talk to agree that it is time to stop the USFS from killing people. Please do not approve their proposed changes that will injure and kill more people. If you do, rest assured that there will be litigation to declare the changes unconstitutional, and a direct intentional discrimination against the disabled, elderly, and infirmed by forcing them to breathe known toxic substances that are known to cause injury and/or death, and by knowingly restricting their access to outside activities. <br/><br/>In contrast to the proposed changes in the Clean Air Act, there are reasonable and effective alternatives to fire for managing our forests. As one website put it: &quot;Unlike fires that kill trees, animals, and people, mechanical methods such as tree thinning and mulching machines remove only unwanted trees and brush grinding them into healthy mulch leaving the forest clean and healthy instead of burned and charred. Mechanical methods are cleaner, safer and properly maintain forest health while protecting the environment from air pollution, but officials argue that prescribed burns are easier, cheaper and increase their budget faster than other methods.&quot;  It is a tragic irony in the fact that the clean air alternatives to fire that the public has pleaded with the Forest Service to use are categorically shot down at the same time that they are asking for immunity through this EPA docket. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I plead with you to not give the U.S. Forest Service immunity to kill people because it will not work. People have Constitutional rights where the forests do not, and it is your duty to protect the people. <br/><br/>Signed,<br/>Anonymous<br/>Prescott, Arizona<br/>",

Specifically, in this Request for Information (RFI), the Bureau seeks comment on: Potential consumer protection concerns with loans that fall outside the scope of the Bureau\u2019s Concurrent Proposal but are designed to serve similar populations and needs as those loans covered by the proposal; and business practices concerning loans falling within the Bureau\u2019s Concurrent Proposal\u2019s coverage that raise potential consumer protection concerns that are not addressed by the Concurrent\nProposal. The Bureau seeks comment from the public about these consumer lending practices to increase the Bureau\u2019s understanding of and support for potential future efforts, including but not limited to future rulemakings, supervision, enforcement, or consumer education initiatives. Where the Bureau requests evidence, data, or other information regarding a particularly concern about consumer protections, the Bureau does not seek information that directly identifies an individual consumer."

They are regulated on a State level, which works just fine!<br/><br/>They provide a service for consumers who really need help and can&#39;t get it anywhere else. They need it<br/>and payday loan companies are there for them, if they need it.<br/><br/>Before you go and make so many rules that will have a DIRECT impact on the<br/>merchant and the consumers, please think about where the consumer who use the service<br/>will go when they need some short term cash. Where and how? Have you talked with actual consumers who<br/>use it and like it?  Do you have a solid resource that will help them if all of them close down?<br/><br/>If payday loan companies are shut down, you will see an increase in crime, you&#39;ll see that<br/>unemployment will increase and states will see a lot less revenue, as well. Consumers will go to <br/>the black market to borrow ( which are not regulated by the state ) money. Payday loan companies<br/>offer a service that is needed!! They are willing to take a chance with consumers... Are you?<br/><br/>This is America, don&#39;t take the right to choose away. Consumers have a choice, they choose if they want <br/>to get a loan and they choose if they want to pay it back in one week or two weeks. Consumers also CHOOSE if <br/>they want to keep borrowing and pay additional fees each time they borrow on a SEPERATE loan.<br/><br/>Ex. Mary borrows money for a week and pays it back. She only pays a small fee and Mary is done.<br/>Larry borrows the same amount, but Larry pays it back in two weeks, he pays more than Mary.<br/>Mary and Larry both made decisions for the same thing, but Larry will pay more because he CHOSE to borrow for a longer <br/>term.  <br/><br/>Payday loans are short term contracts NOT long term. The consumer has a CHOICE!<br/>Let&#39;s do some math here. $100 check advance, use it for one week and only pay $9, <br/>use it for two weeks, and pay $17. They have a choice!<br/>When was the last time you were broke and didn&#39;t have any resources to help you out.<br/>If I didn&#39;t have any resources to help me out, I would GLADLY pay $9 to get $100. Would you? Remember your broke!  <br/><br/>Same thing with a taxi, take a taxi a 1000 miles and pay an outrageous amount. Take it 3 miles and pay reasonable fee.<br/>Taxi&#39;s are not your resource for a long trip, buses or planes are more for long trips.<br/>Will you come out with 1300 new rules for taxi companies as well? If not, why?<br/>Payday loans are not for long term, they are for short term. The contracts are short term as well.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/>Bottom line, let the consumer have a CHOICE, let them choose what&#39;s best for them or do you think consumers <br/>can&#39;t think for themselves and that&#39;s why you want to do it for them? <br/><br/>News flash! <br/>If you shut them down or make rules that will shut them down, the consumers will still need to borrow money~ <br/>that doesn&#39;t go away, it just makes it harder for the consumers...

It is teaching the public that is is okay for humans to own wild animals as pets. It&#39;s letting some think that these would be good pets because they look cute and adorable, but these animals will grow up...what happens then?! These animals belong IN THE WILD. The animals are obviously not getting the appropriate nutrients that they need and that they would be getting if they were in the wild. <br/>There is NO conservation support by allowing them have public contact with humans. &quot;No money the public spends to pet or take photos with tiger cubs ever goes to support conservation in the wild.  In fact, the opposite is true.  There is a huge and growing market for tiger parts like the skins pictured here, and tiger &quot;derivatives&quot;, i.e. products made out of tiger parts like tiger bone wine.  A dead tiger is worth up to $50,000 for its parts. Breeding what US Fish and Wildlife Service calls &quot;generic&quot; tigers like the ones used in the mall exhibits is not tracked.  So there is no way to know how many U.S. born tigers are killed to have their parts illegally sold into this trade.  And, the more that trade expands, the more incentive the poachers have to kill tigers in the wild.&quot; <br/>After the cubs grow up, where will they go? To a zoo? To a roadside zoo? Sold for their parts? NOTHING good can come out of allowing them to be petted, displayed, exploited. <br/>There is potential for disease and liability. &quot;A May 2011 statement from the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) recommends that the public be prohibited from direct contact with tigers due to the risk of illness to humans stating&quot; ...ringworm in 23 persons and multiple animal species was traced to a Microsporum canis infection in a hand-reared zoo tiger cub.&quot;  Zoonotic diseases  those that jump to humans  account for three quarters of all emerging infectious threats, the Center for Disease Control says. Five of the six diseases the agency regards as top threats to national security are zoonotic.  The Journal of Internal Medicine this month estimated that 50 million people worldwide have been infected with zoonotic diseases since 2000 and as many as 78,000 have died.&quot;<br/>Please take all of these facts into consideration and ban public contact with big cats, bears and nonhuman primates.

Histology is a delicate and time consuming art, that can result in suboptimal tissue for diagnosis if rushed.  Under the proposed fee codes, labs will be forced to reduce their histology workforce and overly burden an already stressed histology workforce.  <br/><br/>Similarly, flow cytometry is the cornerstone of diagnosis for many leukemia and lymphoma cancers. A 20% reduction will challenge many labs to be able to continue to offer this vital and time-sensitive testing.  My hospital must perform flow cytometry within an hour of sample collection in order to determine if there are enough cells for a bone marrow transplant; this is not a test that can be outsourced and it requires significant time, expertise, and equipment.  This fee reduction would be devastating for the patients who depend on an accurate and timely pathology diagnosis for their treatment.<br/><br/>No patient should have their tissue rushed when a diagnosis of cancer is on the line.

    "text": "In response to the 8 suggested discussion points from APHIS, I would like to offer the following input:<br/><br/>1. I suggest assigning highest priority to the intrinsic social and emotional needs of the species in question. For example, Is the species classified as endangered or threatened?<br/><br/>2. No animal that is threatened, endangered or has been on such a list is suitable for public contact.<br/>Any animal that has ever struck out against a human being should ever again be permitted to have contact with the public.<br/><br/>3. The current system of managing elephant health, particularly zoonotic diseases, fails to protect the public. USDA/ APHIS has a responsibility to monitor transmittable diseases such as Tuberculosis since dangerous animals cross state and county lines where the rules vary and enforcement of safe practices becomes nearly impossible. With technology as it is today, all medical records of all animals that come into contact with the public need to be made readily accessible online without the burden of filing a FOIA.<br/><br/>5. Where elephants are concerned, training and humane treatment are entirely incompatible. To be trained, an elephant is removed from the very life it is wired to live, the life that allows the entire species to survive.<br/><br/>6. Where elephants are concerned, there is no age where weaning is appropriate as in their natural environment the baby elephant alone makes that determination. To &quot;wean&quot; a baby elephant goes against the behaviors the species itself depends on for survival.<br/><br/>7. For elephants, there are multiple successful sanctuary models that function with consideration for the animal&#39;s needs first. Save Elephant Foundation, Chiang Mai, Thailand, Wildlife SOS, India, The Elephant Sanctuary, Tennessee, US, Performing Animals Welfare Society, California, US, are but a few of those organizations that are well-established in operating care facilities for elephants. The standards these organizations set for care and handling elephants is far superior to what the USDA currently permits. APHIS regulations desperately need updating in this area.<br/><br/>8. Elephants should not be involved with public contact at all. The potential for accidents is too great. The history of accidents and exposure to illness is undeniable. The suffering imposed on elephants in order to make contact possible is inhumane. There is no safe and humane way to contain elephants.",

    "text": "1. What factors and characteristics should determine if a type of animal is suitable for public contact?<br/><br/>I (We) do not support public contact of Big Cats, Bears, and Nonhuman Primates. Domestic animals are the only animals suitable for public contact to ensure safety and control of the animal in all situations. Domestic and farm species (goats, cows, pigs, dogs, cats,etc.) are highly predictable and have been companion animals for thousands of years, unlike these wild and apex predators. Allowing public contact with wild and undomesticated animals presents a danger to both the individual and the community at large.<br/><br/>2. What animals should APHIS consider including under the definition of dangerous animals?<br/><br/>No matter the age or size, exotic wild animals and apex predators(including hybrids and smaller cat species such as Servals and Bobcats) should always be considered USDA ban handling3dangerous animals under APHIS. The deplorable conditions and malpractices (exploited, abused, malnourished, or deprived of both adequate veterinary care and developmental growth) most of these animals are exposed to in captivity, as well as their significant lack of predictability, creates a higher risk of disease, injury and death for all who have public contact with these animals. It is important to remember that even hand-raised cubs are not tame - their wild instincts will kick in as they mature. Domestication of house cats and dogs took thousands of years. We should remember also that the purpose of the Animal Welfare Act is first and foremost to protect animals and public safety.<br/><br/>3. What animals may pose a public health risk and why? What risks does public contact with dangerous animals present to the individual animal and the species and why?<br/><br/>Any animal that belongs in the wild poses a public health risk in captivity. Beyond physical harm, mauling and death, - Big Cats, Bears, and Nonhuman Primates are known carriers of human transferable diseases including ring worm, rabies, herpes B, monkey pox, and salmonellosis, to name a few.<br/><br/>Public contact with Big Cats, Bears, and Nonhuman Primates, regardless of age, poses serious health risks and psychological stress to individual animals. Animals used in public contact opportunities are often over-handled and over worked, constantly transported, and are subject to physical alterations such as defanging and declawing. These procedures are inherently cruel and cause severe pain and long term health issues for the individual animal. Young Big Cats, Bears, and Nonhuman Primates are particularly vulnerable when used in public contact opportunities. These animals are stripped from their mothers - causing weakened immune systems and malnutrition. Allowing public contact with exotic animals - especially these young animals - also ignites an unrealistic and irresponsible representation of how inherently dangerous these animals can be, creating a false narrative that these apex predators can be kept as pets.<br/>",

APHIS is therefore proposing to withdraw the 2017 HPA final rule, and take public comment on this matter.  Comments on the withdrawal are due no later than August 21, 2023."

    "text": "As a gay man serving in the military, as well as my time as a volunteer firefighter, I recognize the importance of having a large supply of donor blood on hand to support not only the regular demands based on accidents and surgery, but the increasing need for large reserves in the event of mass shootings, acts of terrorism, or mass casualty scenarios. There have been many occasions where I have desired to donate blood to support these causes, but I refuse to be required to violate my integrity in order to help those in need. I have been in a relationship with the same individual for seven years, and am regularly tested for HIV in accordance with military health requirements; never have I tested positive. It is unnecessarily demeaning that even though all blood is tested prior to being used, I am prohibited from donating blood. I have volunteered as an organ donor ever since I first obtained my driver&#39;s license, and never was I asked any questions about my health or lifestyle for that ability. If my organs are good enough for others, why not my blood?",

    "text": "The implementation of Obamacare has been a nightmare for me.  It has precluded me from continuing my insurance as the costs are way too high and prevent me from meeting my monthly obligations in terms of paying back student loans, my mortgage, buying food, and paying for other necessities.  I currently just dropped my coverage because I was paying roughly $4500 in premiums and another $4000 in deductibles.  This is compared to roughly $2500-$3000 in premiums and immediate 80/20 coinsurance.  As someone who previously voted for Obama and was basically a life long democrat I am completely dismayed at how poorly the PPACA has been for me and millions of others.  It has not reduced costs, it has only made it more difficult for people making $50k to $100k (upper middle class, but still solidly middle class) to obtain health insurance and try to maintain a comfortable standard of living.  <br/><br/>Short term medical is a great way to maintiain insurance and STILL PAY THE OBAMACARE TAX, and yet pay less than I would if I obtained insurance through the markets.  <br/><br/>It&#39;s ridiculous that the government has essentially outlawed catastrophic insurance.  <br/>  <br/>Then, to add insult to injury, CMS in their latest press release and many democrats/liberals couch the argument as if I&#39;m the one who is at fault for not wanting to pay for things in my insurance plan that I have exactly 0% chance of ever needing.   Strong language has been used that more or less attempts to make people like myself look like freeloaders/wrongdoers (some language strong enough to make us out like criminals) when truly, I&#39;m paying for other people&#39;s services.  Absurd does not sufficiently describe the situation.    <br/><br/>If you at all doubt the veracity of the claim that I voted (and donated) to Obama or was a life long democrat before the absurdity of Obama&#39;s second term, here&#39;s an email that I received from Organizing for Action.  There are many more as I am still bombarded with democrat fundraising emails.  <br/><br/>-----Original Message-----<br/> From: Organizing for Action &lt;info@barackobama.com&gt;<br/> To: <br/> Sent: Mon, Oct 28, 2013 7:50 pm<br/> Subject: Thanks - know anyone else who should take the survey?<br/><br/>Hey -- <br/><br/>Thanks for filling out our quick Obamacare survey. <br/><br/>There&#39;s a lot of talk out there about Obamacare, so we&#39;re thankful for the <br/>opportunity to hear directly from supporters about their experiences.

Current guidance instructs plans to forward to the IRE in all scenarios. This however, can delay care for medically appropriate treatments. We have had cases that can be approved based on documentation provided, but instead are required to forward to the IRE. For example, a recent case took the IRE 93 days to make a determination in which the beneficiary met our CMS approved criteria. Meanwhile, the beneficiary was without medically appropriate treatment for 3 months. This seems to punish the member, and can put their health at risk, instead of the sponsor when forwarding cases that may be approved.<br/><br/>ODAG Record Layout 4 Direct Member Reimbursement and Record Layout 7 Requests for Payment Reconsiderations (PREC) <br/>On both the Direct Member Reimbursement and Payment Reconsiderations (PREC) record layouts there is a column that states &quot;Was interest paid on the reimbursement request&quot;. The time-frame to process these requests is 60 days. Per 42 CFR 422.520(a) a MA organization must pay interest on clean claims that are not paid within 30 days. The type of claims that require interest payments and the timeframe for processing these claims are not consistent with what is to be reported in these record layouts.<br/><br/>2017 Medicare Parts C and D Program Audit Protocols and Data Requests<br/>To assist organizations with identifying the latest changes to the Final 2017 Audit Protocols, can the updates be identified on the document? Such as red-lining the changes, as we have seen with other forms of updated guidance from CMS. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>CDAG and ODAG Timeliness Tests<br/>For timeliness test that are conducted by a count of days it would be extremely helpful if CMS could specify when the clocks starts on the Audit protocol documents. The chapter guidance referenced on these tables has been interpreted by our organization to state that the day the request was received is considered Day 1. If this is not actually the case and the timeliness test during a Program audit would be calculated differently, such as counting day 1 as 24 hours after the request was received, this should be stated in the column &quot;Compliance standard to apply&quot;. Transparency on how CMS administers the timeliness tests as stated on Page 6 of the ODAG Audit Process and Data Request and on Page 7 of the CDAG Audit Process and Data Request would allow MA organizations the ability to report and monitor the timeliness associated with these requests in same manner as CMS. <br/><br/>Call Logs Part C and D <br/>Feedback on this exclusion that is stated on both the Part C and Call Log record layouts: &quot;Exclude any calls not relating to your Part C business (e.g., Medicare Part D, commercial)&quot; OR &quot;Exclude any calls not relating to your Part D business (e.g., Medicare Part C, commercial)&quot;<br/>A customer service representatives can intake a call that relates to both Part C and Part D.  The single call is documented once.  Can CMS re-evaluate this exclusion as it would be extremely difficult to only pull the portion of the call that pertains to the appropriate record layout? Perhaps stating that if a call contains both Part C and D information it can be recorded on both record layouts. <br/><br/>",

    "text": "1. What factors and characteristics should determine if a type of animal is suitable for public contact?<br/>I do not support public contact of Big Cats, Bears, and Nonhuman Primates. Domestic animals are the only animals suitable for public contact to ensure safety and control of the animal in all situations. Domestic and farm species (goats, cows, pigs, dogs, cats,etc.) are highly predictable and have been companion animals for thousands of years, unlike these wild and apex predators. Allowing public contact with wild and undomesticated animals presents a danger to both the individual and the community at large.<br/>2. What animals should APHIS consider including under the definition of dangerous animals?<br/>No matter the age or size, exotic wild animals and apex predators(including hybrids and smaller cat species such as Servals and Bobcats) should always be considered dangerous animals under APHIS. The deplorable conditions and malpractices (exploited, abused, malnourished, or deprived of both adequate veterinary care and developmental growth) most of these animals are exposed to in captivity, as well as their significant lack of predictability, creates a higher risk of disease, injury and death for all who have public contact with these animals. It is important to remember that even hand-raised cubs are not tame - their wild instincts will kick in as they mature. Domestication of house cats and dogs took thousands of years. We should remember also that the purpose of the Animal Welfare Act is first and foremost to protect animals and public safety.<br/>3. What animals may pose a public health risk and why? What risks does public contact with dangerous animals present to the individual animal and the species and why?<br/>Any animal that belongs in the wild poses a public health risk in captivity. Beyond physical harm, mauling and death, - Big Cats, Bears, and Nonhuman Primates are known carriers of human transferable diseases including ring worm, rabies, herpes B, monkey pox, and salmonellosis, to name a few.<br/>Public contact with Big Cats, Bears, and Nonhuman Primates, regardless of age, poses serious health risks and psychological stress to individual animals.

    "text": "In response to the 8 suggested discussion points from APHIS, I would like to offer the following input:<br/><br/>1. I suggest assigning highest priority to the intrinsic social and emotional needs of the species in question. For example, Is the species classified as endangered or threatened?<br/><br/>2. No animal that is threatened, endangered or has been on such a list is suitable for public contact.<br/>Any animal that has ever struck out against a human being should ever again be permitted to have contact with the public.<br/><br/>3. The current system of managing elephant health, particularly zoonotic diseases, fails to protect the public. USDA/ APHIS has a responsibility to monitor transmittable diseases such as Tuberculosis since dangerous animals cross state and county lines where the rules vary and enforcement of safe practices becomes nearly impossible. With technology as it is today, all medical records of all animals that come into contact with the public need to be made readily accessible online without the burden of filing a FOIA.<br/><br/>5. Where elephants are concerned, training and humane treatment are entirely incompatible. To be trained, an elephant is removed from the very life it is wired to live, the life that allows the entire species to survive.<br/><br/>6. Where elephants are concerned, there is no age where weaning is appropriate as in their natural environment the baby elephant alone makes that determination. To &quot;wean&quot; a baby elephant goes against the behaviors the species itself depends on for survival.<br/><br/>7. For elephants, there are multiple successful sanctuary models that function with consideration for the animal&#39;s needs first. Save Elephant Foundation, Chiang Mai, Thailand, Wildlife SOS, India, The Elephant Sanctuary, Tennessee, US, Performing Animals Welfare Society, California, US, are but a few of those organizations that are well-established in operating care facilities for elephants. The standards these organizations set for care and handling elephants is far superior to what the USDA currently permits. APHIS regulations desperately need updating in this area.<br/><br/>8. Elephants should not be involved with public contact at all. The potential for accidents is too great. The history of accidents and exposure to illness is undeniable. The suffering imposed on elephants in order to make contact possible is inhumane. There is no safe and humane way to contain elephants.<br/><br/>Also very important but not included in your list of required comments is the fact that elephants do not like noise.  Allowing elephants to be around noisy humans and machinery is very detrimental to their emotional health.  Therefore a Circus or a Zoo is not a suitable environment for elephants.",

    "docAbstract": "Congress established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau or CFPB) in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). As set forth in section 1021\nof the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau\u2019s purpose is to implement and, where\napplicable, enforce Federal consumer financial law consistently for the\npurpose of ensuring that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services and that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive. In discharging this obligation, the CFPB seeks feedback on practices and products that are related to but may not be addressed in the Bureau\u2019s concurrently published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Payday,\nVehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans (Concurrent\nProposal). Specifically, in this Request for Information (RFI), the Bureau seeks comment on: Potential consumer protection concerns with loans that fall outside the scope of the Bureau\u2019s Concurrent Proposal but are designed to serve similar populations and needs as those loans covered by the proposal; and business practices concerning loans falling within the Bureau\u2019s Concurrent Proposal\u2019s coverage that raise potential consumer protection concerns that are not addressed by the Concurrent\nProposal. The Bureau seeks comment from the public about these consumer lending practices to increase the Bureau\u2019s understanding of and support for potential future efforts, including but not limited to future rulemakings, supervision, enforcement, or consumer education initiatives. Where the Bureau requests evidence, data, or other information regarding a particularly concern about consumer protections, the Bureau does not seek information that directly identifies an individual consumer."

CRCOG&#39;s specific objections are outlined in the included document.  <br/><br/>CRCOG requests a complete withdrawal of the rule.  Local/metropolitan regional decision making is key to successful transportation planning and to integration with land use and economic development. The new rule hampers this very important function.  CRCOG strongly urges withdrawal of the rule or a complete restructuring of the rule to allow for local/metropolitan regional determination of the planning region as well as retention of local input into the transportation planning process.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Lyle Wray<br/>Executive Director<br/><br/>",

    "text": "FDA performs important work under difficult conditions involving multiple new aqpproaches to developing therapeutics. These include precision medicine approaches, gene therapy, antisense modification of DNA/RNA, and use of biomarkers. Generally PDUFA goals for reauthorization that involve metrics refer to timelines for standard and priority review, with objectives for 90% achievement of time limits, there are also objectives for biomarkers, involvement of rare disease staff, use of Real World Evidence, and patient involvement, including in risk benefit analysis. <br/><br/>Recommendations:<br/>1. Include metrics/tabular reports on success in using new data and methods-rare disease involvement/biomarkers/RWE<br/>2. Include some case studies of successful use of drug evaluation in which comprehensive use of such new approaches<br/>resulted in an expedited drug approval, especially for a serious unmet need. <br/>3. Accelerate ways to use Real World Evidence before 2021. 2019 for contract work to find ways to use RWE is too slow. <br/>4. Make recommendations to Congress if necessary to modify substantial evidence to include these new scientific approaches(biomarkers, etc) in addition to &quot;adequate, well controlled&quot; trials. <br/><br/>The PDUFA objectives for these areas using new scientific approaches should also incorporate metrics, as well as &quot;lessons learned.&quot; That is reports and statistics of new drug approvals and NME decisions should incorporate a checklist of whether each of these areas was involved in the approval process. For drug NDA XX2016 or YY2017, a table could be created showing<br/><br/>Drug  Decision/Approval/CRL/etc Date  RareDiseaseStaff   Biomarker  Real World  Patient Involvement   Structured Risk<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Involvement<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Use<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Evidence<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>in Review/Analysis<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Benefit Assmt<br/><br/>Having such tables or checklists could help assess the degree to which each of these tools or new approaches to supplementing and supporting traditional approaches to evaluating whether &quot;substantial evidence of effectiveness,&quot;<br/>in addition to placebo controlled trials, can be established to speed evaluation of new drugs based on such precision<br/>medicine and biomolecular approaches to developing therapies. It is my understanding that the phasing in of a<br/>structured risk benefit approach has already been adopted, and therefore for example the column on structured<br/>risk benefit can be determined for each new drug. The FDA recently included such a structured risk benefit table<br/>in its briefing materials for a DMD drug based on exon skipping, and should clearly be considering whether similar new therapies which offer the potential for treating diseases with serious unmet need should be approved in view of potential benefits if risks are low or minimized.<br/><br/>Among the areas which could be assessed at also the use of biomarkers. use of Real World Evidence, and involvement of rare disease staff. For example, careful use of Patient Record Outcomes (PROs) and Caregive Reported Outcomes (CROs)<br/>should be assessed as part of the emphasis on both Real World Evidence and Patient Involvement.As a corollary, there should be increased use of patient registries and their data on natural history and disease course and progression.  One such example of potentially useful real world evidence is the Caregiver report carefully compiled and reported at a recent Advisory Committee meeting on a DMD therapy for which quality of life and improvement in patient outcomes is a significant objective of the therapeutic drug under consideration, which may only slow progression, but enable better patient outcomes and avoidance of irreversible loss of function while waiting for a full cure.<br/>Rare Diseases<br/>The Rare Disease Program staff in CDER will be integrated into review teams for rare disease development programs and application review to provide their unique expertise on flexible and feasible approaches to studying and reviewing such drugs....innovative use of biomarkers,...non-traditional clinical development programs, use of adaptive study designs, evaluation of novel endpoints,...new approaches to statistical analysis and appropriate use of FDA&#39;s expedited development and review programs (i.e., Fast Track, Breakthrough, Priority Review, and Accelerated Approval).<br/><br/>Enhancing Use of Real World Evidence for Use in Regulatory Decision-Making<br/>By end of FY 2018, FDA will complete one or more public workshop(s) with patients, biopharmaceutical companies and academia to gather input into issues related to Real World Evidence (RWE) ;<br/>By end of FY 2019, FDA will initiate (or fund by contract), appropriate activities (e.g., pilot studies or methodology development projects) aimed at addressing key outstanding concerns and considerations in the use of RWE for regulatory decision making.<br/>And by end of FY 2021, FDA will publish draft guidance on how RWE can contribute to the assessment of safety and effectiveness in regulatory submissions.",
