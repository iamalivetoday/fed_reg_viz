    "text": "The proposed listing of Thunnus orientalis as an endangered species is untimely, unnecessary, and would be a poor choice in the management of the resource.<br/><br/>It is untimely because it is based, simply put, on the premise that the current population is at roughly 3% of the &quot;original, unfished population.&quot; There are two things wrong with this statement: first, it is impossible to exactly count the number of a numerous, pelagic, wide-ranging fish in the vast pacific ocean (even more dubious is the idea that we can know how many there were before we fished for -- or studied -- them); second, the unfished population is a poor metric, as it has no necessary relationship to more relevant metrics like the sustainably fished population, or the minimum species perpetuance baseline. The study that came to this conclusion relies on the estimate* (*emphasis) reached in a study conducted three years ago.  Since that time, greater restrictions were put into place and changes in fish behavior have cast doubts on the accuracy of those studies.  Off California and New Zealand most notably, large numbers of sexually mature and immature fish have appeared that seem to greatly exceed those old estimates of what was left. Finally, new research has uncovered new spawning areas for the Atlantic bluefin, a markedly similar and even better-studied species, and that they mature at smaller sizes than previously believed. We need to make sure we aren&#39;t similarly under-qualifying the Pacific bluefin. Until more research is done to 1) get a more recent population estimate; 2) better define the threshold population at which the species is no longer &quot;threatened&quot; (or what truly constitutes &quot;endangered&quot; -- i.e. at what point the future of the species is truly at risk) 3) confirm the minimum size and age of maturity and 4) determine the major spawning areas, this report is untimely.  <br/><br/>While I understand the inclination that it is better to err on the side of caution, I submit that the quantity of fish observed this year in the two aforementioned locales alone -- biomass numbering by all accounts in the millions of tons -- is a sustainable stock that can still provide great value to mankind. This stock can be fished in such a manner that we still extract value from the resource while allowing the stock to simultaneously grow.  <br/><br/>The US fishery constitutes about .75-.90 PERCENT of the total catch. We make limited, sustainable use of this fishery.  Our listing the species as endangered will be a merely symbolic gesture, and if the fishery were in as grave a state as the proponents of this bill allege, our meek actions here would be in vain.<br/><br/>This listing is therefore unnecessary.  There is a sustainable stock of fish that can handle a limited fishing pressure while simultaneously increasing in biomass.  The proper means of ensuring that the stock is being utilized responsibly and still growing is working with other jurisdictions to practice and enforce catch quotas, particularly on commercial fisheries.  Unless that step is taken, the future of the fish is no better off for our abstinence from fishing them, and it becomes a lose-lose situation.  <br/><br/>If this fishery is managed the way it ought to be managed, there are plenty of fish remaining to ensure we will continue to benefit from their existence for generations to come. The recent severe cutbacks in fishing pressure in US waters is a great model of that process in action, and the rapid and marked increase in numbers and size of bluefin tuna observed off the West coast are doubtlessly not a mere coincidence. I encourage the federal agencies charged with this decision to make the right choice for the fish and the persons who enjoy and benefit from the harvest of the resource -- do not list this species as endangered.<br/><br/>Thank you for you time,<br/><br/>Alexander Jassy Selman",

    "text": "Please do not overreact and list the Pacific Bluefin as endangered.  The west coast United States fishery is a highly seasonal but economically significant part of the overall west coast fishery.  The United States Bluefin fishery on BOTH coasts is already managed in an appropriate and responsible way with existing regulation.  <br/><br/>I also question the accuracy of science based fishery management of any pelagic species.  We simply do not know enough about any of the Tunas to list them as endangered because the populations are highly migratory and naturally variant.  <br/><br/>Japan and Mexico due far more damage to the stock.  Yet despite this, the stock remains healthy and viable.  Encouraging the commercial fisheries of those nations to be more responsible and sustainable is a far better approach to the Bluefin stock management.    <br/>",

    "text": "Navy Region Northwest Comment on the Petition for Determination That Adequate Facilities for the Safe <br/>and Sanitary Removal and Treatment of Sewage From All Vessels Are Reasonably Available for the <br/>Waters of Puget Sound<br/><br/>Navy Region Northwest appreciates the opportunity to comment on EPA&#39;s tentative <br/>determination that adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment <br/>of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for waters subject to Washington&#39;s <br/>planned No Discharge Zone.<br/><br/>Navy Region Northwest recognizes that the compilation of facilities included recognition<br/>of three stationary facilities dedicated to Navy vessel usage.<br/><br/>Although EPA does not specifically ask for comment or clarifications related to the <br/>petition for a No Discharge Zone, we would like to mention the following comment for EPA <br/>and WA Department of Ecology consideration as you finalize the determination. <br/> <br/>Comment: Navy Region Northwest recommends that military vessels be defined in <br/>accordance with the definition provided at Clean Water Act Section 312 (a)(14) and recognized <br/>as a class of vessels distinct from commercial vessels while considering the proposed <br/>establishment of a No Discharge Zone (NDZ) for Washington State&#39;s Puget Sound waters.  <br/>The petition currently does not distinguish or define vessels of the Armed Forces. <br/><br/>Clean Water Act Section 312 (a)(14) defines &quot;vessel of the Armed Forces&quot; as follows: <br/><br/>(14) &quot;vessel of the Armed Forces&quot; means --<br/>(A) any vessel owned or operated by the Department of Defense, other than a time or voyage chartered vessel; and<br/>(B) any vessel owned or operated by the Department of Transportation that is designated by the Secretary of the <br/>department in which the Coast Guard is operating as a vessel equivalent to a vessel described in subparagraph (A).<br/><br/>Navy Region Northwest recommends the No Discharge Zone determination make explicit that its application to <br/>vessels of the Armed Forces is subject to the authority of Clean Water Act Section 312 (d). <br/><br/>Rationale:  Clarifying the definition of &quot;vessel of the Armed Forces&quot; will recognize the authority granted by Congress <br/>to the Secretary of Defense to determine when compliance with standards and regulations under Clean Water Act <br/>Section 312 would not be in the interest of national security.  Pursuant to Section 312 (d), the Secretary of Defense <br/>promulgated DoD 4715.06-R1 Regulations on Vessels Owned or Operated by the Department of Defense <br/>(January 2005).  This Regulation exempts, at certain times and under certain circumstances, some vessels from the <br/>sewage discharge requirements of the Clean Water Act when compliance for certain vessels &quot;would excessively and <br/>unreasonably detract from their military characteristics, effectiveness, or safety to not be in the interest of national security.&quot;  <br/>The regulation nonetheless requires vessels of the Armed Forces to limit discharge of sewage into U.S. navigable <br/>waters, territorial seas, and EPA delineated &quot;No Discharge Zones&quot; designated under the Clean Water Act to the <br/>maximum extent practicable without endangering the health, safety, or welfare of the crew or other personnel aboard.  <br/>Therefore, Commanding Officers limit discharges to the maximum extent practicable and use pump out facilities before <br/>departure from port or attempt to limit discharges to allowed areas out to sea; but, there may be occasional need for <br/>some vessels to discharge within the No Discharge Zone.",

    "text": "I have fished recreationally in the waters ranging from Costa Rica to Northern California. I can tell you from personal experience that bluefin are a very hard fish to catch hook and line fishing. They require one to use undersized tackle to just get a bite which most often results in not getting the fish to the boat. This past season I spent nearly 200 hours and a few thousand dollars  fishing these fish, spotting thousands of bluefin crashing on the surface and even more underneath the surface on my depth sounder each and everyday I fished. In those 200 hours of pain staking and frustrating fishing I was only able to hook 6 fish and actually bring 4 in to the boat. As was the results for many of my friends who recreationally fish. I can personally vouch that recreational fishing does not and could never pose a real threat to the populations of these fish, especially considering that the daily limit is already only 2 fish per day. These fish come in to our local waters for a brief window of time each year. So we as recreational fishermen are only able to get the opportunity for a short amount of time and considering the difficulty of getting one to bite a hooked bait and then winning the battle to the boat, I would say the odds are on the fishes side.<br/><br/>So with all that said, to put a ban on all bluefin fishing would be a very heart felt blow to the few hundred people I personally  know of in my fishing community. Not to mention a very significant reduction of revenue to our community and nation. <br/><br/>The focus of the regulation should be pointed at the big corporations who use unfair means to catch these fish, such as seiners. Banning all fishing of these fish would eventually result in an over abundance of the species, which in turn would have adverse effects on the prey of the species. Humans play a role in the population balance of the environment and cannot be completely removed. If seiners were replaced with jig stick boats where the fish has to bite a bait, the schools would not be completely removed and continue to be able to reproduce among the remaining fish.",

I have performed well over a thousand physicals for this program in the past 8 years. I am a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC).  <br/><br/>It is my understanding that this current proposal excludes DCs in the VA from being included in the program to certify doctors to perform physicals on driver in the VA system.  This is troubling for a few reasons.  1) DCs such as myself are able to become CMEs under the FMCSA rules.  This should be no different for DCs within the VA system.   2) DCs are indeed included within the VA system and are on staff at numerous VA facilities across the nation.  3) The skills and knowledge required for the CDL exams are well within our training.  Every part of the CDL exam is covered on the National Board exams that all DCs take as a condition to be eligible for a license.  4) The VA system is struggling to keep up with demand, and it make no sense to exclude a class of providers perfectly capable of providing this service.  <br/><br/>As noted above, there are several reasons to include DCs within this program.  The only reason to exclude is due to inter-professional politics AKA &quot;turf war&quot;.  Do what is right for our veteran drivers.  Include DCs in this program. <br/><br/>",

    "text": "The recreational fisherman is not the problem:<br/><br/>Pacific bluefin are a very LOW RETENTION species. I have fished many times this year (and years past for that matter) and seen thousands of fish, yet the boat catches single digits of them for the whole trip? Our impact on these schools is minimal (when they are even around to catch). We also reduced our limit last year from 5 to 2, so its even smaller now.<br/>According to CBDs own petition, US recreational fishermen have only caught 12-809 metric tons of bluefin per year since 1990, which is less than a tenth of the total catch across the Pacific (8,000-34,000 mt annually) those same years. The vast majority of bluefin are caught by commercial purse seine and longline gears. We already gave! Further regulation of the U.S. recreational fishery would have UNDUE ECONOMIC IMPACT, with little to no benefit to the bluefin population.<br/><br/>Thank You,<br/>Brian Knott<br/>31562 Catalina Ave<br/>Laguna Beach, CA<br/>92651<br/><br/>949-422-2090",

I know own and operate a 25-foot sportfisher here in Southern California. <br/> <br/>Spending the past 40-years pursueing the highly ELUSIVE Bluefin tuna reveals how incredibly difficult it is to hook even a single bluefin over the course of an entire season as these fish almost always refuse to take baited hooks using live bait on the lightest of gear. Typical years the average size of bluefin here range 10-30 lbs. Medium size fish in the 40-60 lb range are  less common. Larger 60-80 lb fish showing in our waters is an EXTREMELY RARE EVENT. Regardless of the bluefins size, hooking a bluefin of any size is in a typical year is indeed is a very rare event and the few bluefin actually caught remains extremely low so closing this fishery serves no reasonable purpose to help rebuild the stock of this tuna species.  <br/><br/>I wish to close by saying that closing down the bluefin fishery here in California makes ZERO sense as these fish are rarely if ever hooked and the ones that are landed are almost never of breeder size.  Taking such an extreme measure to close the entire bluefin fishery is nothing less than an ill advised since it&quot;s based on bad science.  Furthermore, closing the bluefin fishery will result in extreme hardship to the all sportfishing communities, it&#39;s industry, related operations, bait companies, tackle companies, tackle stores, sport fishing vessels, commercial fisherman, and the heavy loss of tax revenues to the suffering economy in California. This is nothing short of a POOR idea so please put a stop to this movement immediately. <br/><br/>Respectfully, Michael Moore <br/><br/>   <br/>  <br/>",

The proposal generally would cover two categories of loans. First, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term of 45 days or less or loans with multiple advances if each advance is required to be repaid within 45 days. Second, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term greater than 45 days, provided that they (1) have an all-in annual percentage rate greater than 36 percent; and (2) either are repaid directly from the consumer\u2019s account or income or are secured by the consumer\u2019s vehicle. For both categories of covered loans, the proposal would identify it as an abusive and unfair practice for a lender to make a covered loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal generally would require that, before making a covered loan, a lender must reasonably determine that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal also would impose certain restrictions on making covered loans when a consumer has or recently had certain an outstanding covered loan. The proposal would provide lenders with options to make covered loans without satisfying the ability-to-repay requirements, if those loans meet certain conditions. The proposal also would identify it as an unfair and abusive practice to attempt to withdraw payment from a consumer\u2019s account for a\ncovered loan after two consecutive payment attempts have failed. The proposal would require lenders to provide certain notices to the consumer before attempting to withdraw payment for a\ncovered loan from the consumer\u2019s account.
