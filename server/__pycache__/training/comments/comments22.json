    "text": "Good afternoon. Today, I received a mass emailing from the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce, encouraging me to go to the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) link on submitting comments regarding the Waters of the US Rule (WOTUS). NAM had a prepared text which could be simply signed and submitted for comment to USEPA. I read through the text, and was puzzled by the references to how difficult it had become for businesses to plan their operations, given the restraints of WOTUS. How could this be, when the State brags so much about how open for business they are, and the tremendous growth of manufacturing in Tennessee? And other states are doing the same?<br/>As an engineer with three decades of experience in environmental compliance for several manufacturers and processors, I appreciate the frustrations of some of the regs. But to imply WOTUS is some kind of monstrous rule for manufacturers is a stretch. And, we must work harder as a nation to improve water quality for all people, and our valuable ecosystems. That trumps what are often short term economic gains from manufacturers and other businesses moving into new sites, some of which are businesses just moving from one state to another. <br/>EPA is already tame. No need to continue diluting its importance. As the inevitable negotiations run their course on WOTUS, don&#39;t give too much thought to the multitude of canned responses you&#39;re going to be getting from NAM and their state level associates.",

    "text": "Hello, my name is Travis Massey and I reside in a small coastal town Trinidad, CA. I am also currently an undergraduate student at Humboldt State University studying Environmental Science and work as a Scientific Aid for California&#39;s Department of Fish and Wildlife. As a HSU student and employee of CDFW I witness and study the effects of climate change happening in the Redwood north coast region and have great concern for the final determination of the Mid-Term Evaluation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Model Year (MY) 2022-2025 Light Duty Vehicles. This comment&#39;s intention is to support the proposed GHG standards initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation&#39;s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in effort to curtail climate change and protect American consumers and industry.<br/><br/>As the climate continues to change due to anthropogenic factors, mostly the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, dangers imposed on citizens worldwide increases. The United States has witnessed a horrendous hurricane season wreck devastation at home and abroad. California experienced years of drought, then record breaking precipitation in the Sierra Nevada&#39;s. As the earth warms, polar ice caps melt, and sea level rises millions of people living in large coastal cities will be dislocated. The warming ocean causes storms to intensify with larger time lapses in between thereby increasing risks of drought, famine, and erosion. Ocean acidification further decreases biological diversity and the earth&#39;s ability to distribute heat exasperating these dangers in a positive feedback loop. This scientific evidence is well known, and the greatest response possible is through reducing GHG emissions today with technological advancements and regulation. <br/><br/>The Mid-Term Evaluation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Model Year 2022-2025 Light Duty Vehicles must stay its course with more stringent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. As NHTSA considers these standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) and Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) along with EPA under the Clean Air Act (CAA) section 202(a) I implore the agencies to concede to the years of research, policy making, and agency partners supporting the GHG standards for MY 2022-2025. The Federal Register the document on page 14671 wrote that the &quot;EPA, NHTSA, and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) released for public comment a jointly prepared Draft Technical Assessment Report&quot; ( Vol. 82, No. 54 /Wednesday, March 22, 2017 / Proposed Rules), which examined a range of issues relevant to GHG emissions and CAFE standards for MYs 2022-2025. The Technology Assessment Report (TAR) results suggest the auto industry is capable of adhering to the GHG standards and would be most economically feasible for both consumers who save in fuel efficiency, as well as an evolving auto industry market worldwide. Both Britain and France have made dramatic propositions to end the sale of gasoline and diesel cars by 2040 and car manufacturer Volvo stated that all vehicle models of 2019 will be hybrid or battery powered. If the U.S. markets do not act competitively now, they risk losing a major foothold in worldwide markets.<br/><br/>California&#39;s Air and Resources Board (CARB) chairman Mary D. Nicholas strongly supports the Obama administrations implementation of these GHG standards and intends to commit California regulations to these standards regardless of federal decision which will affect 1/3 of the auto industry market regardless. This would create separate regulatory agencies revolving around an issue with such extraordinarily negative impacts which the American government ought to remain united in solidarity to resolve anthropogenic climate change.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this comment is intended to support the EPA and NHTSA in their review process to establish GHG emission standards previously set by the first term. The benefits to U.S. citizens and the world are staggering as this ruling has the possibility to reduce GHG emissions by 540 million metric tons and reduce oil consumption by 1.2 billion barrels over the 2022-2025 vehicle&#39;s lifetimes. The ruling would also establish solidarity in regulation, protect consumers, and vitalize the auto industry&#39;s ability to compete in an evolving world market. Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/><br/>Travis Massey<br/>",

The pet store chain in question was getting its puppies from USDA-licensed breeders and dealers. Breeders who do not follow USDA&#39;s disease-prevention and sanitation protocols may be partly responsible for this outbreak. Many of the most problematic USDA-licensed breeders have routinely renewed their licenses year after year, even when they were cited for numerous sanitation or veterinary care violations. Therefore, for the protection of both animals and the public, I support a rule that would end the re-licensing of pet breeders with repeat health, safety and animal welfare violations.

The &quot;Law of Return,&quot; the rule &quot;Feed the soil, not the plant,&quot; and the promotion of biodiversity, provide the ecological basis for organic production. The Law of Return says that we must return to the soil what we take from the soil. The dictum to &quot;Feed the soil, not the plant&quot; reminds us that the soil is a living superorganism that supports plant life as part of an ecological community. Finally, biological diversity is important to the health of natural ecosystems and agroecosystems. Biodiversity promotes balance, which protects farms from outbreaks of damaging insects and disease. It supports the health of the soil through the progression of the seasons and stresses associated with weather and farming. It supports our health by offering a diversity of foods. Hydroponics is not consistent with these principles.<br/><br/>Containerized culture may be eligible for organic certification under limited circumstances in which organic soil-building and other organic practices are used. These are essentially the same practices that would be required for growing in permanent beds in the soil. <br/><br/>We support the subcommittee proposals for prohibiting hydroponics and delineating acceptable practices for organic containers.<br/><br/>Marine biodiversity is important, and the roles played by marine algae (seaweed) are important to marine biodiversity and ecology. Human threats to marine environments include overfishing, global warming, biological introductions, and pollution. The NOSB should continue its efforts to clarify the identities of species of marine algae used in organic production as well as to develop guidance for the application of the wildcrafting standard to marine algae. Application of scientific names to seaweeds needs to be clarified to ensure protection, and any restrictions need to be justified.  <br/><br/>The NOSB must investigate mechanisms for protecting marine ecology from the impacts of over-harvesting marine algae for use in organic products and production. It must also look at natural materials in use in crops and livestock, as well as those on the National List. Lastly, the NOSB must protect rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) to the extent possible and specifically list it as a prohibited natural.  <br/><br/>Seaweeds and products made from them should be allowed as ingredients in organic food, feed to organic livestock, and crop inputs only &quot;when harvested from a designated area that has had no prohibited substance applied to it for a period of 3 years immediately preceding harvest and when harvested in a manner that ensures that such harvesting or gathering will not be destructive to the environment and will sustain the growth and production of the population of the species.&quot; <br/><br/>&quot;Inert&quot; ingredients frequently compose as much as 99% of pesticide products. So-called &quot;inert&quot; ingredients are typically not biologically and chemically inert, and are not disclosed to users or others who may be exposed.  Due to NOSB scrutiny of active ingredients, &quot;inert&quot; ingredients may be the most hazardous ingredients in pesticide products used in organic production. We urge the NOSB to insist that NOP move forward quickly with implementation of the NOSB recommendations on inert ingredients. Allowing the current lack of movement to persist raises serious compliance issues and threatens the integrity of the USDA organic label.",

However, the problem with redesigning OSAC to create version 2.0, is that if these changes include major adjustments to mission/structure, then it is unclear how this body will be staffed, and how it can effectively exist within the vacuum left after dismantling the former SWGs.

    "text": "I&#39;m writing in response to a request for comments by the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration (FMCSA) regarding an application for exemption [Docket No. FMCSA-2017-0243] from requirements to use electronic logging devices (ELDs) submitted by the Power &amp; Communication Contractors Association (PCCA). PCCA represents contractors, manufacturers, and distributors who build and repair America&#39;s power and communications infrastructure, including electric transmission, distribution, and substation facilities and broadband, telephone, and cable television systems. As a member of PCCA, I strongly support this exemption request. Drivers in the power and communications construction industry operate under significantly different circumstances than interstate truck drivers and should not be burdened with the harmful impacts of the ELD rule, pending December of this year. <br/><br/>On a typical workday, construction workers spend short amounts of time driving, unlike typical over-the-road truck drivers who spend most of their time driving in a single vehicle. Contractors spend considerable time working off-road on the jobsite, not on public roads or highways, and a single CMV may have several different drivers over the course of a day. Drivers working on broadband and/or electric infrastructure projects commonly drive multiple vehicles for short distances within a single day, and a single vehicle is often driven by multiple drivers. We operate a wide range of vehicles such as flatbeds, skid trucks, dump trucks, and buses used to transport workers and equipment to and from a particular jobsite. Because of the limited time within a workday that our drivers spend driving on public roads, ELD and RODS requirements for drivers in our industries will not result in increased safety. <br/><br/>Drivers in our industry use numerous exemptions to hours-of-service requirements in order to keep the lights on, such as the utility service vehicle and short haul exemptions. Because of this, our drivers will very rarely have to use ELDs. Yet, the final ELD rule will force our industry to purchase and install ELDs, train on the use of ELDs, and monitor drivers who will very rarely (if ever) need to log in to an ELD.<br/><br/>Navigating ELD requirements when drivers may fall under varying exemptions will make compliance difficult, exposing our drivers to unknowing violations. As an employer in this important industry, I would rather dedicate dollars for training on more relevant safety issues. Exempting PCCA contractors from the ELD rule would not compromise the safety of commercial drivers in any way, and power and communication contractors will continue to meet all other HOS requirements overseen by FMCSA.<br/><br/>The ELD rule allows drivers to use paper logs for recording on-duty status where they exceed the limitation of the short haul exemption on not more than 8 days out of every 30-day period. While the full exemption requested in the PCCA application is warranted and should be provided for the power and communication construction industry, there are steps the agency could take to alleviate regulatory burdens associated with this rule. If FMCSA were to extend the number of days allowing drivers to use written paper logs when they exceed the requirements of the short-haul exception from 8 days to 16 days, some relief from the burden of this rule would be provided. Still, it seems that the most effective way to address these issues would be through a full exemption of drivers in our industry.  <br/> <br/>PCCA submitted comments in support of an exemption request by the Pipe Line Contractors Association [Docket No. FMCSA-2017-0175] for many of the same reasons. As part of the construction industry, I support the PLCA exemption request as well. Construction drivers meet a variety of job functions and spend the vast majority of their time on a jobsite within a short distance of their daily assembly point, not on public roads and highways. Exempting construction workers from ELD requirements will allow employers to better focus their energies and resources.",

    "text": "Aug 4, 2017<br/><br/>Administrator  Scott Pruitt<br/><br/>Dear Administrator Pruitt  and Deputy Assistant Secretary Lamont,<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Docket Number EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0203-0001, which repeals the 2015 Clean Water Rule. I&#39;m a sportsman and I strongly oppose repealing the Clean Water Rule.<br/><br/>Finalized in 2015, the Rule clarifies that the Clean Water Act protects 20 million acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of headwater streams -- 60% of the country&#39;s flowing waters. These waters shield communities from flooding, supply drinking water to one in three Americans, and provide essential fish and wildlife habitat that supports a robust outdoor recreation economy worth $887 billion annually. The hunting and fishing industries in the United States directly employ 483,000 Americans.<br/><br/>The Clean Water Rule is firmly grounded in science. In developing the rule, EPA analyzed more than 1,200 peer-reviewed and other studies that assessed connections between small streams, non-tidal wetlands, and other upstream waters on larger downstream waters, including lakes, rivers, and estuaries. That review demonstrated the significant physical, chemical and biological connections between wetlands and headwaters streams to larger rivers. To balance the need to protect our nation&#39;s waters with the interests of those whose activities affect water quality, the Rule also explicitly excludes some waters, like puddles and most roadside ditches, from regulation. The agencies also preserved existing exemptions for categories of activities like normal farming and ranching practices.<br/><br/>I also believe that repealing the Clean Water Rule and codifying the status quo will lead to uncertainty for States, federal and states water quality personnel, those who need permits and the public. In the last ten years, the &quot;status quo&quot; has hurt the efforts of sportsmen and women to protect water resources; contributed to permit delays; and left Corps water quality personnel spending large amounts of time trying to decide which waters the Clean Water Act protects. The Corps will now continue to make permitting decisions on a case-by-case basis indefinitely, and as a result, it will cause uncertainty for all involved in permitting. In addition, the 2008 guidance document that the Corps is using as the &quot;status quo&quot; to decide jurisdiction was not based on publicly available scientific, technical, or economic analyses, and it was never published in the Federal Register for public comment. This document is no substitute for a properly-issued rule.<br/><br/>If we cannot protect our most crucial resource what does that say about the type of people we have become. Our founding fathers would be ashamed. It&#39;s 2017 for god sakes. Pull your head out of the past and starting believing in science. Your children depend on it. Grow a spine, and listen to the (educated and informed) American people, and tell your greed driven donors to get lost.<br/><br/>To justify the repeal, the agencies rely on a seriously flawed economic analysis. To arrive at a net benefit justifying repeal of the 2015 Rule, the agencies removed the estimated $306 billion in annual benefits that would result from the 2015 Rule protecting wetlands. The agencies have said Americans may value streams and wetlands less than they did in 2014, but they don&#39;t give any reason why the public would value clean water less than they did before. As a sportsman, I value clean water and I support conserving our wetlands and small streams.<br/><br/>Repealing the Clean Water Rule is a huge step backward in achieving the goal of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the nation&#39;s waters. I believe in the goal of the Clean Water Act and I respectfully ask that you protect the streams and wetlands so important to hunters and anglers.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Mr. John Getts<br/>1640 El Rancho Way<br/>Santa Rosa, CA 95404-3004<br/>(707) 495-7076",

So far, 55 people have become ill and many were hospitalized. The pet store chain in question was getting its puppies from USDA-licensed breeders. Breeders who do not follow disease-prevention and sanitation protocols may be partly responsible for this outbreak. Therefore, I support a rule that would end the re-licensing of pet breeders with repeat health and safety violations, for the protection of both animals and people.<br/>Thank you so very much,<br/>Kristin ",

On the ground level, where public buyer meets the seller of bred animals, the public relies on APHIS inspections for healthy, medically clean animals that haven&#39;t been mistreated or neglected. Sadly, this is a dirty business that NEEDS APHIS, and that includes implementation of a new law that clamps down on repeat violators who neglect animals in their ambition for profit. We only recently heard about the sickening Petland incidents, and yet we see breeders and exhibitors attempting to game the system far to often. Please institute this new rule and strip licensing of repeat violators. Thank you!",

    "text": "Organic farming has long been defined by the complex biological systems that farmers nurture, which produce nutrient-dense food. Certified organic farmers are required by the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) to maintain soil health. Despite the OFPA law and a similar recommendation by the National Organic Standards Board in 2010, the National Organic Program has been allowing soil-less growing systems (aka hydroponic) to be certified as organic for the last several years. Soil-less production depends on fertilization with every watering, and most hydroponic growers use hydrolyzed conventional soybeans for fertility. With vast greenhouses full of plastic containers and tubing, industrial hydroponic systems do nothing to cycle nutrients, capture carbon, or improve the land. Hydroponics may have a place in a sustainable future, but products should be labeled as &quot;hydroponic,&quot; not organic, so consumers can make informed decisions.<br/><br/>The above statements are not original to me. I do ascribe to the message from the Cornucopia Institute. As a small farm struggling with the vagaries of the growing season and knowing what I need to do in terms of soil building to maintain a USDA Certified organic farm I feel it is blaspheme to now even consider hydroponically grown as organic.<br/><br/>The thousands of small organic farms, even if their numbers were combined do not have the financial assets of those mega growers who now appear to be buying favorable decisions.<br/><br/>&quot;It is an era dominated by industry, in which the right to make a dollar at whatever cost is seldom challenged.&quot; Rachel Carson, Silent Spring<br/>",

This must be stopped. Without soil, there is no organic farming. The USDA is defrauding anyone who trusts the USDA Certified Organic label by allowing hydroponically grown produce to be sold as USDA Certified Organic.

Application of scientific names to seaweeds needs to be clarified to ensure protection, and any restrictions need to be justified.  <br/><br/>I ask that NOSB please investigate mechanisms for protecting marine ecology from the impacts of over-harvesting marine algae for use in organic products and production. It must also look at natural materials in use in crops and livestock, as well as those on the National List. Lastly, the NOSB must protect rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) to the extent possible and specifically list it as a prohibited natural.  <br/><br/>Seaweeds (marine algae) and products made from them should be allowed as ingredients in organic food, feed to organic livestock, and crop inputs only &quot;when harvested from a designated area that has had no prohibited substance applied to it for a period of 3 years immediately preceding harvest and when harvested in a manner that ensures that such harvesting or gathering will not be destructive to the environment and will sustain the growth and production of the population of the species.&quot; <br/><br/>Finally, the &quot;Inert&quot; ingredients frequently compose as much as 99% of pesticide products.  So-called &quot;inert&quot; ingredients are typically not biologically and chemically inert, and are not disclosed to users or others who may be exposed.  Due to NOSB scrutiny of active ingredients, &quot;inert&quot; ingredients may be the most hazardous ingredients in pesticide products used in organic production. We urge the NOSB to insist that NOP move forward quickly with implementation of the NOSB recommendations on inert ingredients.

I&#39;m a sportsman and I strongly oppose repealing the Clean Water Rule.<br/><br/>Finalized in 2015, the Rule clarifies that the Clean Water Act protects<br/>20 million acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of headwater streams -- 60% of the country&#39;s flowing waters.

The hunting and fishing industries in the United States directly employ 483,000 Americans.<br/><br/>The Clean Water Rule is firmly grounded in science. In developing the rule, EPA analyzed more than 1,200 peer-reviewed and other studies that assessed connections between small streams, non-tidal wetlands, and other upstream waters on larger downstream waters, including lakes, rivers, and estuaries. That review demonstrated the significant physical, chemical and biological connections between wetlands and headwaters streams to larger rivers. To balance the need to protect our nation&#39;s waters with the interests of those whose activities affect water quality, the Rule also explicitly excludes some waters, like puddles and most roadside ditches, from regulation.

    "text": "I&#39;m writing in response to a request for comments by the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration (FMCSA) regarding an application for exemption [Docket No. FMCSA-2017-0243] from requirements to use electronic logging devices (ELDs) submitted by the Power &amp; Communication Contractors Association (PCCA). PCCA represents contractors, manufacturers, and distributors who build and repair America&#39;s power and communications infrastructure, including electric transmission, distribution, and substation facilities and broadband, telephone, and cable television systems. As a member of PCCA, I strongly support this exemption request. Drivers in the power and communications construction industry operate under significantly different circumstances than interstate truck drivers and should not be burdened with the harmful impacts of the ELD rule, pending December of this year. <br/><br/>On a typical workday, construction workers spend short amounts of time driving, unlike typical over-the-road truck drivers who spend most of their time driving in a single vehicle. Contractors spend considerable time working off-road on the jobsite, not on public roads or highways, and a single CMV may have several different drivers over the course of a day. Drivers working on broadband and/or electric infrastructure projects commonly drive multiple vehicles for short distances within a single day, and a single vehicle is often driven by multiple drivers. We operate a wide range of vehicles such as flatbeds, skid trucks, dump trucks, and buses used to transport workers and equipment to and from a particular jobsite. Because of the limited time within a workday that our drivers spend driving on public roads, ELD and RODS requirements for drivers in our industries will not result in increased safety. <br/><br/>Drivers in our industry use numerous exemptions to hours-of-service requirements in order to keep the lights on, such as the utility service vehicle and short haul exemptions. Because of this, our drivers will very rarely have to use ELDs. Yet, the final ELD rule will force our industry to purchase and install ELDs, train on the use of ELDs, and monitor drivers who will very rarely (if ever) need to log in to an ELD.<br/><br/>Navigating ELD requirements when drivers may fall under varying exemptions will make compliance difficult, exposing our drivers to unknowing violations. As an employer in this important industry, I would rather dedicate dollars for training on more relevant safety issues. Exempting PCCA contractors from the ELD rule would not compromise the safety of commercial drivers in any way, and power and communication contractors will continue to meet all other HOS requirements overseen by FMCSA.<br/><br/>The ELD rule allows drivers to use paper logs for recording on-duty status where they exceed the limitation of the short haul exemption on not more than 8 days out of every 30-day period. While the full exemption requested in the PCCA application is warranted and should be provided for the power and communication construction industry, there are steps the agency could take to alleviate regulatory burdens associated with this rule. If FMCSA were to extend the number of days allowing drivers to use written paper logs when they exceed the requirements of the short-haul exception from 8 days to 16 days, some relief from the burden of this rule would be provided. Still, it seems that the most effective way to address these issues would be through a full exemption of drivers in our industry.  <br/> <br/>PCCA submitted comments in support of an exemption request by the Pipe Line Contractors Association [Docket No. FMCSA-2017-0175] for many of the same reasons. As part of the construction industry, I support the PLCA exemption request as well. Construction drivers meet a variety of job functions and spend the vast majority of their time on a jobsite within a short distance of their daily assembly point, not on public roads and highways. Exempting construction workers from ELD requirements will allow employers to better focus their energies and resources.",

I&#39;m a sportsman and I strongly oppose repealing the Clean Water Rule.<br/><br/>Finalized in 2015, the Rule clarifies that the Clean Water Act protects 20 million acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of headwater streams -- 60% of the country&#39;s flowing waters. These waters shield communities from flooding, supply drinking water to one in three Americans, and provide essential fish and wildlife habitat that supports a robust outdoor recreation economy worth $887 billion annually. The hunting and fishing industries in the United States directly employ 483,000 Americans.<br/><br/>The Clean Water Rule is firmly grounded in science. In developing the rule, EPA analyzed more than 1,200 peer-reviewed and other studies that assessed connections between small streams, non-tidal wetlands, and other upstream waters on larger downstream waters, including lakes, rivers, and estuaries. That review demonstrated the significant physical, chemical and biological connections between wetlands and headwaters streams to larger rivers. To balance the need to protect our nation&#39;s waters with the interests of those whose activities affect water quality, the Rule also explicitly excludes some waters, like puddles and most roadside ditches, from regulation. The agencies also preserved existing exemptions for categories of activities like normal farming and ranching practices.<br/><br/>Secretary Pruit<br/>I have spent my entire life swimming, fishing, sailing exploring the Chesepeake Bay, I fish and recreate on the Potomac River.  I fish streams in Pennsylvania and Colorado.  Clean water provides jobs and Revenue to local and national business.<br/>Please do not repeal this Rule.<br/><br/>I also believe that repealing the Clean Water Rule and codifying the status quo will lead to uncertainty for States, federal and states water quality personnel, those who need permits and the public. In the last ten years, the &quot;status quo&quot; has hurt the efforts of sportsmen and women to protect water resources; contributed to permit delays; and left Corps water quality personnel spending large amounts of time trying to decide which waters the Clean Water Act protects. The Corps will now continue to make permitting decisions on a case-by-case basis indefinitely, and as a result, it will cause uncertainty for all involved in permitting. In addition, the 2008 guidance document that the Corps is using as the &quot;status quo&quot; to decide jurisdiction was not based on publicly available scientific, technical, or economic analyses, and it was never published in the Federal Register for public comment. This document is no substitute for a properly-issued rule.<br/><br/>To justify the repeal, the agencies rely on a seriously flawed economic analysis. To arrive at a net benefit justifying repeal of the 2015 Rule, the agencies removed the estimated $306 billion in annual benefits that would result from the 2015 Rule protecting wetlands. The agencies have said Americans may value streams and wetlands less than they did in 2014, but they don&#39;t give any reason why the public would value clean water less than they did before. As a sportsman, I value clean water and I support conserving our wetlands and small streams.<br/><br/>Repealing the Clean Water Rule is a huge step backward in achieving the goal of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the nation&#39;s waters. I believe in the goal of the Clean Water Act and I respectfully ask that you protect the streams and wetlands so important to hunters and anglers.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Mr. james wohlgemuth<br/>3140 Klingle Rd NW<br/>Washington, DC 20008-3351<br/>(202) 679-0946",

    "text": "I am commenting in support of the Volkswagen petition for an exemption from the federal motor vehicle safety standards requiring the binary use of low beams or high beams.<br/><br/>VW has provided NHTSA with a petition and supporting materials to justify its request for a two year exemption in favor of its computerized LED headlight system that would change the shape of high beams in order to avoid glare in oncoming or preceding traffic, a system it has already deployed in Europe. VW emphasizes the physical advantages of its headlight system.<br/><br/>I would ask NHTSA to take notice of the behavior of drivers as well as the effects of the VW headlight system.  Some drivers, perhaps most, VW notes, will underuse high beams, increasing the danger to themselves and to others; other drivers, such as older drivers with night vision issues, may overuse high beams, increasing the danger to others through glare, Yet other drivers may make poor choices in determining when to move from high to low beams, or low to high beams. It&#39;s even possible that the need to switch a beam from low to high, or high to low, could distract a driver. The VW system corrects these problems.<br/><br/>There are deficiencies in VW&#39;s materials that have the effect of understating their own case for an exemption.  VW did not investigate high beam/low beam use for nonstationary traffic in a population above the age of 55 (or for stationary objects, above the age of 68).  First, that overlooked aging population, with worse night vision than younger subjects, can be expected to overuse high beams at a greater rate than average.  Second, there are certainly some drivers under the age of 55 who also overuse high beams and endanger preceding and oncoming traffic. Because VW only presented average usage, this subset of high beam drivers, as part of the total VW sample, would mask an even greater overuse of low beams in other drivers.  Both subsets of poorly performing drivers present a greater risk than VW presents by giving one simple, average underuse of high beams.  Therefore, VW has likely understated the risks of the current system and the advantages of the VW system.  The case for this exemption is stronger than the petition describes.<br/><br/>I&#39;m sure that the basis for the current regulations were to advance earlier headlight technology by requiring installation of easily usable high beams. I appreciate that NHTSA has provided an exemption process to forward its role in promoting road safety.  It would certainly be ironic if the current regulations, adopted for the purpose of safety, were applied in a manner that prevented improved headlight systems.  <br/><br/>Please grant this petition.",

    "text": "I&#39;m writing in response to a request for comments by the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration (FMCSA) regarding an application for exemption [Docket No. FMCSA-2017-0243] from requirements to use electronic logging devices (ELDs) submitted by the Power &amp; Communication Contractors Association (PCCA). PCCA represents contractors, manufacturers, and distributors who build and repair America&#39;s power and communications infrastructure, including electric transmission, distribution, and substation facilities and broadband, telephone, and cable television systems. As a member of PCCA, I strongly support this exemption request. Drivers in the power and communications construction industry operate under significantly different circumstances than interstate truck drivers and should not be burdened with the harmful impacts of the ELD rule, pending December of this year. <br/><br/>On a typical workday, construction workers spend short amounts of time driving, unlike typical over-the-road truck drivers who spend most of their time driving in a single vehicle. Contractors spend considerable time working off-road on the jobsite, not on public roads or highways, and a single CMV may have several different drivers over the course of a day. Drivers working on broadband and/or electric infrastructure projects commonly drive multiple vehicles for short distances within a single day, and a single vehicle is often driven by multiple drivers. We operate a wide range of vehicles such as flatbeds, skid trucks, dump trucks, and buses used to transport workers and equipment to and from a particular jobsite. Because of the limited time within a workday that our drivers spend driving on public roads, ELD and RODS requirements for drivers in our industries will not result in increased safety. <br/><br/>Drivers in our industry use numerous exemptions to hours-of-service requirements in order to keep the lights on, such as the utility service vehicle and short haul exemptions. Because of this, our drivers will very rarely have to use ELDs. Yet, the final ELD rule will force our industry to purchase and install ELDs, train on the use of ELDs, and monitor drivers who will very rarely (if ever) need to log in to an ELD.<br/><br/>Navigating ELD requirements when drivers may fall under varying exemptions will make compliance difficult, exposing our drivers to unknowing violations. As an employer in this important industry, I would rather dedicate dollars for training on more relevant safety issues. Exempting PCCA contractors from the ELD rule would not compromise the safety of commercial drivers in any way, and power and communication contractors will continue to meet all other HOS requirements overseen by FMCSA.<br/><br/>The ELD rule allows drivers to use paper logs for recording on-duty status where they exceed the limitation of the short haul exemption on not more than 8 days out of every 30-day period. While the full exemption requested in the PCCA application is warranted and should be provided for the power and communication construction industry, there are steps the agency could take to alleviate regulatory burdens associated with this rule. If FMCSA were to extend the number of days allowing drivers to use written paper logs when they exceed the requirements of the short-haul exception from 8 days to 16 days, some relief from the burden of this rule would be provided. Still, it seems that the most effective way to address these issues would be through a full exemption of drivers in our industry.  <br/> <br/>PCCA submitted comments in support of an exemption request by the Pipe Line Contractors Association [Docket No. FMCSA-2017-0175] for many of the same reasons. As part of the construction industry, I support the PLCA exemption request as well. Construction drivers meet a variety of job functions and spend the vast majority of their time on a jobsite within a short distance of their daily assembly point, not on public roads and highways. Exempting construction workers from ELD requirements will allow employers to better focus their energies and resources.",

    "text": "I am now 62-years-old. Perhaps it all started when I was 5-years-old and woke up screaming with neck pain, which was treated by the family chiropractor.  Or maybe when I was about 7-years-old, while at my best friend&#39;s house playing outside during a summer heat wave.  I somehow ran home with my very first migraine, which I remember to this day.  As the years passed, I continued having them and still get them, off and on.  I had my 1st MRI with, and w/o, contrast in my early 40s.  I was diagnosed with MS, yet was told about a million other things as well.  The MRI shows a substantial brain lesion.  I want to add that test results can not always show how awful chronic pain is!  Then about 10 years ago, &quot;something&quot; happened to my hand.  It was huge, burned and firey red for about 3-4 months.  It never dawned on me to see a neurologist.  I went to a rheumatologist who told me that he had never seen snything like it.  Eventually, it calmed down but did leave deformity.  Then, in 2012 I had a same-day hemorrhoid surgery,  It was this surgery that left me unable to eat, sleep walk, concentrate!  A neurologist did an EMG and said I had neuropathy.  He prescribed Nabumetone rather than me taking 800mg. ibuprofen and 1mg Xanax per day.  This continued for several months until I could no longer accept barely walking along with the pain, burning and fatigue, etc.  This was not living.  It was/is so bad that I had ZERO quality of life!  It had to be fixed!  Except, there was no way it could be fixed.  Then my 1st pain management specialist ordered a Lumbar MRI with and w/o contrast; herniated discs, DDD and more.  I have seen four PM doctors from 2012 until now.  The first 3 grew disgusted because I was not responding to the spine injections as they expected.  By this time I learned to accept getting these injections, or risk losing my opioid prescription because doctors do NOT want a patient who is not compliant.  And even though I knew that I was compliant, I also knew that I did not want to be labled a &quot;doctor shopper&quot;  A few years later I had to have the rest of my teeth extracted as Mecicaid stopped covering root canals and crowns. That happened in 2013 and along with my Rheumatoid Arthritis I learned I have Sjogrens Syndrome, which is why I lost my teeth.  If I wasn&#39;t in so much pain in my back and legs, I NEVER would have had the rest extracted! Now, 3-4 years and two sets of dentures later, the dentures won&#39;t stay in due to bone loss.  Through this nightmare I have learned that a pain management doctor earns much more when giving spine injections.  The last time I agreed to accept this, the injection caused my leg to swell, burning pain, etc.  And though this doctor was truly concerned, he prescribed a strong muscle relaxant, rather than an opiate.  However, the muscle relaxant put me in such a deep sleep, I was struggling to stay awake!  It was during Thanksgiving week and it was only my daughter and me and, though grown, it was very frightening for anyone, especially Autistic.  That happened a few years ago and this very doctor has suddenly become very rude. I have also been trying to supplement with Gabapentin per his order/idea etc.  Rather than helping it causes short term memory loss and hair loss!!!  Also, a month ago I told him if he was going to continue decreasing my dose, I would just go on Suboxone.. It&#39;s a 50 mile round trip to get to his appts.  and I never know what to expect anymore. To which he clearly told me he would keep me at the same dose, which I always figure out on my own because after five years of same med/same dose I have built up quite a tolerance. So at my appt. last week, he asks me how much longer we have to go through this!  Very confusing and demeaning.  There is more to share...but I can&#39;t type anymore tonight.  Obviously, there is no concern about the many hours/days lost.  Living with Chronic Pain/Fatigue  also puts a very intense burden on friends and families.   There are also MANY details I am too fatigued and in too much pain to type.  I lost my job, my cake business and much more.  If I had been on an opiate, along with a support group, etc. years back, I would not have lost my cake business (photos attached).  ",

    "text": "(Summary of Comment Only, Full Comment Attached)<br/><br/>We appreciate the opportunity to comment regarding the Reconsideration of the Final Determination of the Mid-Term Evaluation of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Standards for Model Year (MY) 2022-2025 Light-Duty Vehicles and MY 2021 GHG Emission Standards (collectively the GHG Standards).  This comment letter (Comment) is submitted on behalf of Pearson Fuels, the largest supplier of E85 in the California market. This Comment supplements the prior comment of Pearson Fuels to this proceeding dated September 5, 2017.  <br/><br/>As one of the leading suppliers of E85 fuel in the country, Pearson Fuels primary interest in this proceeding is to ensure that the policy value of flex fuel vehicles (FFVs) that utilize E85 fuel is properly considered in this proceeding and integrated into the federal policy framework.  The policy value of FFVs encompasses the energy security, GHG reduction, and cost savings that these proven vehicles deliver when utilizing E85 fuel; as well as the additional value that FFVs and E85 stations provide as a necessary vehicle and infrastructure bridge to next generation high-octane fuels and high-octane vehicles. <br/><br/>This Comment consists of this brief overview letter coupled with Part II of Pearson Fuels comment to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) relating to NHTSAs preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards (Comment to NHTSA).  Pearson Fuels Comment to NHTSA is submitted to this GHG docket because of EPAs role as a cooperating agency to NHTSA in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process, and because of the efforts of NHTSA and EPA to harmonize the GHG and CAFE standards.  As a result of the interrelated nature of the GHG and CAFE standards, there are many factual, technical and factual issues in the Comment to NHTSA that pertain to both proceedings.<br/> <br/>The following aspects of the attached Comment to NHTSA are particularly germane to this GHG Standards proceeding:<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In developing the CAFE and GHG standards, NHTSA and EPA are required by NEPA and Executive Order 13783 to employ the best available peer-reviewed science and economics including lifecycle assessments of ethanol prepared by EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB).<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Empirical data from California regarding FFVs, GHG reduction, and E85 pricing and volume contradicts assumptions made by EPA in prior rulemakings and factual determinations.  These prior factual determinations underlie current CAFE and GHG credit calculation methodologies for FFVs.<br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Based on the best available peer-reviewed science and empirical evidence, it is appropriate for EPA to revisit its F factor guidance.<br/><br/>We recognize that EPAs F factor guidance constitutes a factual determination by the agency that is appropriately made outside the scope of the CAFE and GHG standards rulemaking processes.  We therefore plan to work with eligible manufacturers to follow the process established by 40 C.F.R. 600.510-12(k) to initiate one or more formal requests for F factor determinations from EPA.   <br/>",

    "text": "On behalf of the 500 Commissioners in Iowas 100 Soil and Water Conservation Districts, Conservation Districts of Iowa (CDI) is submitting these comments on the Federal Register citation 2017-19337. The consolidation mentioned in the final bullet point under Section II. Reorganization Activities is vague, leading our membership to have concerns about the actual intent of the Federal Register Notice.<br/><br/>Currently, our Districts work hand in hand with Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) offices where staff intimately know and understand the counties where they are located, developing long-standing relationships with our constituents. NRCS offices also house Soil and Water Conservation District Commissioners and District staff. This close knit partnership allows the NRCS to be nimble and responsive to Iowans needs at critical moments impacting conservation activities.<br/><br/>Consolidating mission support activities, including information technology, finance, property, procurement and human resources at the mission area level brings us pause. We see this reorganization as potentially leaving Iowas counties underserved or with no service causing detrimental effects to the progress of conservation in Iowa.<br/><br/>Conservation happens on Iowa properties with local input of support activities, information technology, finance, property, procurement, and human resource decisions made at the NRCS. Without additional language describing specifically what will change and where the consolidation will take place, it leads us to believe these decisions would be taken out of the local and state level and rest with decision makers over one thousand miles away. CDI does not believe this is a comprehensive idea that would streamline any processes; rather it would impede progress in Iowa.<br/><br/>A specific example of a local partnership with NRCS is illustrated by recent agreements CDI has with NRCS.<br/><br/>The NRCS developed an agreement with CDI and the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship to employ specialists throughout Iowa.  Specialists are providing specific technical assistance in areas that would improve soil health and improve water quality.<br/><br/>NRCS has been instrumental in localizing financial and technical support in<br/>underserved counties by allowing CDI to hire four wildlife specialists, four wetland<br/>easement specialists with our Iowa Department of Natural Resources partners to<br/>reach a common goal.<br/><br/>In short, consolidating mission support activities is not acceptable to CDIs<br/>constituents without additional planning and input from the Districts to ensure we<br/>continue to receive critical personalized services from NRCS here in Iowa.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Linda King, Executive Director<br/>Conservation Districts of Iowa",

The &quot;Law of Return,&quot; the rule &quot;Feed the soil, not the plant,&quot; and the promotion of biodiversity, provide the ecological basis for organic production. The Law of Return says that we must return to the soil what we take from the soil. The dictum to &quot;Feed the soil, not the plant&quot; reminds us that the soil is a living superorganism that supports plant life as part of an ecological community. Finally, biological diversity is important to the health of natural ecosystems and agroecosystems. Biodiversity promotes balance, which protects farms from outbreaks of damaging insects and disease. It supports the health of the soil through the progression of the seasons and stresses associated with weather and farming. It supports our health by offering a diversity of foods. Hydroponics is not consistent with these principles.<br/><br/>Containerized culture may be eligible for organic certification under limited circumstances in which organic soil-building and other organic practices are used.

I&#39;m a sportsman and I strongly oppose repealing the Clean Water Rule.<br/><br/>Finalized in 2015, the Rule clarifies that the Clean Water Act protects<br/>20 million acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of headwater streams  60% of the country&#39;s flowing waters. These waters shield communities from flooding, supply drinking water to one in three Americans, and provide essential fish and wildlife habitat that supports a robust outdoor recreation economy worth $887 billion annually. The hunting and fishing industries in the United States directly employ 483,000 Americans.<br/><br/>The Clean Water Rule is firmly grounded in science. In developing the rule, EPA analyzed more than 1,200 peer-reviewed and other studies that assessed connections between small streams, non-tidal wetlands, and other upstream waters on larger downstream waters, including lakes, rivers, and estuaries. That review demonstrated the significant physical, chemical and biological connections between wetlands and headwaters streams to larger rivers. To balance the need to protect our nation&#39;s waters with the interests of those whose activities affect water quality, the Rule also explicitly excludes some waters, like puddles and most roadside ditches, from regulation. The agencies also preserved existing exemptions for categories of activities like normal farming and ranching practices.<br/><br/>I grew up playing and fishing in the Kalamazoo River in Michigan and was devastated to hear of the recent pipeline disaster there.<br/><br/>I also believe that repealing the Clean Water Rule and codifying the status quo will lead to uncertainty, for States, federal and states water quality personnel, those who need permits and the public. In the last ten years, the &quot;status quo&quot; has hurt the efforts of sportsmen and women to protect water resources; contributed to permit delays; and left Corps water quality personnel spending large amounts of time trying to decide which waters the Clean Water Act protects. The Corps will now continue to make permitting decisions on a case-by-case basis indefinitely, and as a result, it will cause uncertainty for all involved in permitting. In addition, the 2008 guidance document that the Corps is using as the &quot;status quo&quot; to decide jurisdiction was not based on publicly available scientific, technical, or economic analyses, and it was never published in the Federal Register for public comment. This document is no substitute for a properly-issued rule.<br/><br/>To justify the repeal, the agencies rely on a seriously flawed economic analysis. To arrive at a net benefit justifying repeal of the 2015 Rule, the agencies removed the estimated $306 billion in annual benefits that would result from the 2015 Rule protecting wetlands. The agencies have said Americans may value streams and wetlands less than they did in 2014, but they don&#39;t give any reason why the public would value clean water less than they did before. As a sportsman, I value clean water and I support conserving our wetlands and small streams.<br/><br/>Repealing the Clean Water Rule is a huge step backward in achieving the goal of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the nation&#39;s waters. I believe in the goal of the Clean Water Act and I respectfully ask that you protect the streams and wetlands so important to hunters and anglers.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Mr. Don Thomsen<br/>WA 99202-4278<br/>",

    "text": "(A)  Purpose<br/>Because OSAC is supposed to be the new source of consented standards, some scientific working groups have gone down, no longer updating standards.  In theory this makes sense.  In practice, given the timeframe OSAC needs, disciplines are left without an authority on standards/guidelines.  The SWGs should be the starting point for OSAC guidelines and the existing SWGs should be acknowledged as the remaining authority until OSAC standards are established.  <br/>In terms of openness, OSAC should at some point establish chat boards for general &amp; discipline specific inquiries.  Practitioners talk among themselves in chat boards regularly.  This would consolidate chats into one place for all disciplines &amp; give OSAC a better understanding of the issues practitioners are facing.<br/>Membership could include a general category for those not serving in any capacity, but who want to show affiliation &amp; adherence (much like membership in professional organizations).<br/><br/>(B) Oversight &amp; Independence<br/>OSAC should serve much like a scientific working group with practitioners at all levels available to offer insight.  It should be hosted like a professional association, with each discipline governed primarily by those elected from within the discipline, but also those who are specific to OSAC (much like a QA manager) which may be a governmental influence. <br/><br/>(C) Work Products &amp; Aims <br/>Again, SWGs have rescinded authority in the wake of the implementation of OSAC, but disciplines still need that information maintained.  SWGs should be acknowledged as the remaining authority until OSAC standards are established.  The SWGs should be the starting point for OSAC guidelines.  Each item addressed by a SWG should be addressed or visited by OSAC as these issues have been seen as necessary by the disciplines.  OSAC should create standards for essential elements, and guidelines/best practices for non-critical elements.  <br/><br/>(D) Structure<br/>I personally have not seen developments from OSAC that are useful to me, yet, so I can not comment on how effective it is.  This is the main reason I stress the importance of the SWGs.  Perhaps information is out there &amp; I have not seen it  that would be a problem.  Perhaps the information is not yet relevant to me  which is why the SWGs worked in the past: they were specific to the disciplines needs.  That being said, I do agree that there needs to be an umbrella of standards for all disciplines.  But I have also seen in the past where an umbrella of standards sounds great until you get into the specific of each discipline &amp; those umbrellas need to be reworked to suit the needs of each/all disciplines.  The problem with some SWGs is that they are seen as guidelines by some organizations/practitioners who then choose to follow/not follow.  OSAC should create standards for essential elements, and guidelines/best practices for non-critical elements.  <br/><br/>(E) Participation<br/>OSAC should serve as the standards development organization for practitioners of forensic science, with accreditation bodies considered so as to not conflict.  All other stakeholders should be secondary.  Forensic science researchers may be given a secondary consideration.  Legal practitioners should be allowed to provide insight, but should not be allowed to determine forensic science standards.  Metrologists may be necessary in some disciplines with. Human factors experts insight may be necessary in some disciplines, but should not be allowed to determine forensic science standards.  <br/><br/>(F) Funding<br/>OSAC should be fully funded by the federal government.  Membership fees may be borne by the members organization unless they are serving on a board.  Certification fees may be borne by the members organization unless certification is required.  Meeting &amp; registration fees may be borne by the members organization with scholarships set aside for lower funded agencies.  Funding should be much like a professional organization. <br/>",

    "text": "I&#39;m writing in response to a request for comments by the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration (FMCSA) regarding an application for exemption [Docket No. FMCSA-2017-0243] from requirements to use electronic logging devices (ELDs) submitted by the Power &amp; Communication Contractors Association (PCCA). PCCA represents contractors, manufacturers, and distributors who build and repair America&#39;s power and communications infrastructure, including electric transmission, distribution, and substation facilities and broadband, telephone, and cable television systems. As a member of PCCA, I strongly support this exemption request. Drivers in the power and communications construction industry operate under significantly different circumstances than interstate truck drivers and should not be burdened with the harmful impacts of the ELD rule, pending December of this year. <br/><br/>On a typical workday, construction workers spend short amounts of time driving, unlike typical over-the-road truck drivers who spend most of their time driving in a single vehicle. Contractors spend considerable time working off-road on the jobsite, not on public roads or highways, and a single CMV may have several different drivers over the course of a day. Drivers working on broadband and/or electric infrastructure projects commonly drive multiple vehicles for short distances within a single day, and a single vehicle is often driven by multiple drivers. We operate a wide range of vehicles such as flatbeds, skid trucks, dump trucks, and buses used to transport workers and equipment to and from a particular jobsite. Because of the limited time within a workday that our drivers spend driving on public roads, ELD and RODS requirements for drivers in our industries will not result in increased safety. <br/><br/>Drivers in our industry use numerous exemptions to hours-of-service requirements in order to keep the lights on, such as the utility service vehicle and short haul exemptions. Because of this, our drivers will very rarely have to use ELDs. Yet, the final ELD rule will force our industry to purchase and install ELDs, train on the use of ELDs, and monitor drivers who will very rarely (if ever) need to log in to an ELD.<br/><br/>Navigating ELD requirements when drivers may fall under varying exemptions will make compliance difficult, exposing our drivers to unknowing violations. As an employer in this important industry, I would rather dedicate dollars for training on more relevant safety issues. Exempting PCCA contractors from the ELD rule would not compromise the safety of commercial drivers in any way, and power and communication contractors will continue to meet all other HOS requirements overseen by FMCSA.<br/><br/>The ELD rule allows drivers to use paper logs for recording on-duty status where they exceed the limitation of the short haul exemption on not more than 8 days out of every 30-day period. While the full exemption requested in the PCCA application is warranted and should be provided for the power and communication construction industry, there are steps the agency could take to alleviate regulatory burdens associated with this rule. If FMCSA were to extend the number of days allowing drivers to use written paper logs when they exceed the requirements of the short-haul exception from 8 days to 16 days, some relief from the burden of this rule would be provided. Still, it seems that the most effective way to address these issues would be through a full exemption of drivers in our industry.  <br/> <br/>PCCA submitted comments in support of an exemption request by the Pipe Line Contractors Association [Docket No. FMCSA-2017-0175] for many of the same reasons. As part of the construction industry, I support the PLCA exemption request as well. Construction drivers meet a variety of job functions and spend the vast majority of their time on a jobsite within a short distance of their daily assembly point, not on public roads and highways. Exempting construction workers from ELD requirements will allow employers to better focus their energies and resources.",

    "text": "I have concerns about the changes being considered to the regulations governing the use of the term &quot;organic.&quot;  Specifically:<br/><br/>Hydroponics<br/>Organic production is soil-based and is defined by principles concerning the grower&#39;s relationship to the soil. The &quot;Law of Return,&quot; the rule &quot;Feed the soil, not the plant,&quot; and the promotion of biodiversity, provide the ecological basis for organic production. The Law of Return says that we must return to the soil what we take from the soil. The dictum to &quot;Feed the soil, not the plant&quot; reminds us that the soil is a living superorganism that supports plant life as part of an ecological community. Finally, biological diversity is important to the health of natural ecosystems and agroecosystems. Biodiversity promotes balance, which protects farms from outbreaks of damaging insects and disease. It supports the health of the soil through the progression of the seasons and stresses associated with weather and farming. It supports our health by offering a diversity of foods. Hydroponics is not consistent with these principles.<br/><br/>Containerized culture may be eligible for organic certification under limited circumstances in which organic soil-building and other organic practices are used. These are essentially the same practices that would be required for growing in permanent beds in the soil. <br/><br/>We support the subcommittee proposals for prohibiting hydroponics and delineating acceptable practices for organic containers.<br/><br/>Marine materials (Seaweeds and products of seaweeds)<br/>Marine biodiversity is important, and the roles played by marine algae (seaweed) are important to marine biodiversity and ecology. Human threats to marine environments include overfishing, global warming, biological introductions, and pollution. The NOSB should continue its efforts to clarify the identities of species of marine algae used in organic production as well as to develop guidance for the application of the wildcrafting standard to marine algae. Application of scientific names to seaweeds needs to be clarified to ensure protection, and any restrictions need to be justified.  <br/><br/>The NOSB must investigate mechanisms for protecting marine ecology from the impacts of over-harvesting marine algae for use in organic products and production. It must also look at natural materials in use in crops and livestock, as well as those on the National List. Lastly, the NOSB must protect rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) to the extent possible and specifically list it as a prohibited natural.  <br/><br/>Seaweeds (marine algae) and products made from them should be allowed as ingredients in organic food, feed to organic livestock, and crop inputs only &quot;when harvested from a designated area that has had no prohibited substance applied to it for a period of 3 years immediately preceding harvest and when harvested in a manner that ensures that such harvesting or gathering will not be destructive to the environment and will sustain the growth and production of the population of the species.&quot; <br/><br/>&quot;Inert&quot; Ingredients in Organic Production<br/>&quot;Inert&quot; ingredients frequently compose as much as 99% of pesticide products.  So-called &quot;inert&quot; ingredients are typically not biologically and chemically inert, and are not disclosed to users or others who may be exposed.  Due to NOSB scrutiny of active ingredients, &quot;inert&quot; ingredients may be the most hazardous ingredients in pesticide products used in organic production. We urge the NOSB to insist that NOP move forward quickly with implementation of the NOSB recommendations on inert ingredients. Allowing the current lack of movement to persist raises serious compliance issues and threatens the integrity of the USDA organic label.",

    "text": "<br/>Jul 29, 2017<br/><br/>Administrator  Scott Pruitt<br/><br/>Dear Administrator Pruitt  and Deputy Assistant Secretary Lamont Administrator  Pruitt,<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Docket Number EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0203, which repeals the 2015 Clean Water Rule. I&#39;m a sportsman and I strongly oppose repealing the Clean Water Rule.<br/><br/>Finalized in 2015, the Rule clarifies that the Clean Water Act protects<br/>20 million acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of headwater streams -- 60% of the country&#39;s flowing waters. These waters shield communities from flooding, supply drinking water to one in three Americans, and provide essential fish and wildlife habitat that supports a robust outdoor recreation economy worth $887 billion annually. The hunting and fishing industries in the United States directly employ 483,000 Americans.<br/><br/>The Clean Water Rule is firmly grounded in science. In developing the rule, EPA analyzed more than 1,200 peer-reviewed and other studies that assessed connections between small streams, non-tidal wetlands, and other upstream waters on larger downstream waters, including lakes, rivers, and estuaries. That review demonstrated the significant physical, chemical and biological connections between wetlands and headwaters streams to larger rivers. To balance the need to protect our nation&#39;s waters with the interests of those whose activities affect water quality, the Rule also explicitly excludes some waters, like puddles and most roadside ditches, from regulation. The agencies also preserved existing exemptions for categories of activities like normal farming and ranching practices.<br/><br/>My first duck was taken on a public wetland that is fed from a stream.<br/>I would love to be able to take my kids there some day for their first hunt, but without proper protection, there is no guarantee that water will provide sustainable habitat for ducks and other wildlife. Some of my best memories of collecting crawfish with my family, or fishing trout with my friends, could be relegated to only memories, rather than having opportunities for future enjoyment.<br/><br/>I also believe that repealing the Clean Water Rule and codifying the status quo will lead to uncertainty for States, federal and states water quality personnel, those who need permits and the public. In the last ten years, the &quot;status quo&quot; has hurt the efforts of sportsmen and women to protect water resources; contributed to permit delays; and left Corps water quality personnel spending large amounts of time trying to decide which waters the Clean Water Act protects. The Corps will now continue to make permitting decisions on a case-by-case basis indefinitely, and as a result, it will cause uncertainty for all involved in permitting. In addition, the 2008 guidance document that the Corps is using as the &quot;status quo&quot; to decide jurisdiction was not based on publicly available scientific, technical, or economic analyses, and it was never published in the Federal Register for public comment. This document is no substitute for a properly-issued rule.<br/><br/>To justify the repeal, the agencies rely on a seriously flawed economic analysis. To arrive at a net benefit justifying repeal of the 2015 Rule, the agencies removed the estimated $306 billion in annual benefits that would result from the 2015 Rule protecting wetlands. The agencies have said Americans may value streams and wetlands less than they did in 2014, but they don&#39;t give any reason why the public would value clean water less than they did before. As a sportsman, I value clean water and I support conserving our wetlands and small streams.<br/><br/>Repealing the Clean Water Rule is a huge step backward in achieving the goal of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the nation&#39;s waters. I believe in the goal of the Clean Water Act and I respectfully ask that you protect the streams and wetlands so important to hunters and anglers.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Mr. Mike Marzolf<br/>1930 Sunset Dr<br/>Twin Lakes, WI 53181-9235<br/><br/>",
