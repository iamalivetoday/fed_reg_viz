Most dealers are completely transparent on all transactions start to finish. Requesting that customers fill out more paperwork for compliance is ludicrous. This most certainly will result in negative interactions with dealers. Consumers number 1 request from dealers is &quot;get me out of the dealership faster&quot;! This will do the opposite! It will also crumble the foundation of trust by asking a customer to read a document and sign it after every number presentation. There are no doubt some dealers out there doing things the wrong way, but if we are foolish enough to believe this will rehab those problem dealers, then shame on us. Simply put, crack down on the bad guys. Don&#39;t penalize the good guys, and certainly don&#39;t make customers go through more unnecessary paper work. ",

The proposed rule targeted at franchised dealerships will dramatically alter the way we do business and (in my opinion) hurt customer satisfaction.  Our sales process is extremely transparent and easy and quick for our customers.  We are extremely proud of our customer satisfaction levels and these levels will go down due to unnecessary paperwork, forms, extended transaction times, and an overall increased difficulty in completing a transaction.  <br/><br/>The products we offer our customers serve a great value.  With the increased costs of parts and labor and increased technology, vehicle service contracts serve as great protection against high repair bills.  Just recently, we have had a number of engines that need replacing that are costing our customers in the area of $10,000.  A couple of these customers have extended warranties and are only going to have to pay $100 to have their vehicle repaired.  This definitely saves our customers financial hardship.  Every dealer that I know is very transparent in their processes and looks for the best interest of their customers for long term customer satisfaction.  Even small repairs can cost thousands of dollars which create hardships for consumers.  Vehicle extended warranties are usually a small percentage of the price of the total vehicle and a definitely a better value than extended warranties on TV&#39;s, stereos, and other electronics.  Our happiest customers are the customers that have extended warranty coverage and the extended warranty covers their repairs.  We also have had to do a lot more business &quot;online&quot; over the last couple of years due to covid and other factors, more regulations will make this more difficult for consumers and create unnecessary hardships.<br/><br/>There are plenty of statutes already in existence protecting consumers and the vast majority of dealerships work in the best interests of our customers.  Most dealerships are in small towns and if we don&#39;t treat our customers well - we will not stay in business.  More regulation will only force us to raise our prices or (worst case scenario) force us to close our doors.  The local car dealers employ a lot of people and are usually the first organization supporting local charitable causes the build our communities.  <br/><br/>Please don&#39;t force unnecessary regulations on us.<br/><br/>Thank you",

Hopefully the FTC is able to see my comments together, but if not I will write this as a standalone. <br/><br/>A prevailing argument in these public comments by car salespeople is that this proposed regulation would add time to the buying process and THAT would hurt consumers. Anyone who&#39;s been in a car dealer&#39;s financing office recently knows that these documents are shoved in your face and you&#39;re pressured to sign quickly because there are more to go. Paraphrasing here, but the sentiment after waiting hours through the negotiation process is &quot;You have a shiny new car waiting to be delivered, so let&#39;s just get through all this&quot;. This is the time they try to get you to sign for additional products you don&#39;t want, but even if that weren&#39;t the case, I would argue that no consumer on Earth would be mad about 2 extra minutes signing any additional paperwork that would be required by this regulation if it meant they knew they weren&#39;t being overcharged by thousands of dollars. Commenters using the &quot;time&quot; argument are industry professionals brigading this public comment process who think they&#39;ve found the crux of consumer&#39;s main complaint (waiting hours for delivery after deciding to buy). I would challenge the FTC to find any consumer in any part of the country to say they&#39;d rather spend $1,000 more than they should than spend an extra 2 minutes signing paperwork that the dealer flies you through (which is another problem altogether).

I agree on allowing the U.S. Department of Education gain more knowledge on how funds are being distributed to the State Educational Agencies as a well as the Local Educational Agencies. $800 Million dollar investment for a one time grant program can hold a lot of responsibility and stat management to gain confidence in changing the amount of homeless kids and youth that are not getting the right education nor engaging in activities that most kids have the opportunity of having. Children education and engagement they start off at a young age builds character, confidence, a sense of well being, and establishing who they are at a young age. Every quality named matters in that previous sentence matters in regards to understanding how this grant can change the lives of kids all over the U.S. The issues to address directly would be the spread of the program in every state of the U.S. without allowing specific states to be pardoned or excused of participation. Homelessness of the youth most often happen because of mishaps with parents or family, in which the child has no decision on such a heavy burden they begin to carry at such a young age. Due to this factor, every state should be able and willing to participate in working with SEAs and LEAs to provide the best opportunity to offering a school system and programs associated with. &quot;A staggering 2.5 million children are now homeless each year in America. This historic high represents one in every 30 children in the United States.&quot; With this came the stats that with these high numbers almost 80% of youth that are homeless are in a constant worry or scare. You don&#39;t have to have children to see that the start of the fix of educating the homeless children which in this case happen to be the less fortunate to even have to gain an education in such mental state and environment is truly important and nothing but data and understanding on how these programs will be implemented is important. Is the funding only for homeless children staying in a shelter? Will this grant provide educational information on how to overcome poverty and the mindset that may be attached to poverty?  Making sure that the funds are used to increase productivity on education with in the homeless youth in hopes to protect the mind of the youth in less influential environments while providing equal opportunity for those in need. Agencies working with the Department of Education should bring a healthier, happier, and more understanding population of homeless youth in hopes to cut back on that outstanding number  in the united states. The children who are homeless can suffer from behavior issues, self respect, and many more characteristics involved in a lower self esteem. Understanding that with this proposal we can create change in a generation with providing an equal opportunity at a young age. ",

This let&#39;s the person doing CPR to know how long they have until the paramedics get there. And it would also give the paramedics an idea that somebody was responsive on the scene at a specific time. These options provide many other features to come.

Have an AED system in your home if your 55 years and older and upgrades need to come to the systems to help the process for everyone. CPR can be scary for someone who isn&#39;t medically trained. I believe the better prepared the person doing the CPR the better chance of survival for the person thier trying to save.

    "text": "I would argue that OpenDoor has not discontinued their deceitful marketing. We sold our home to OpenDoor in December of 2021. They assured us that the offer would be a &ldquo;fair market value&rdquo; and that they did not flip houses for profit, but rather sold the service of making the process easier for sellers. They also assured us that they would only ask for fair repairs that the buyers would likely request in a normal realtor facilitated transaction. None of these things proved to be true.<br/><br/>They ended up requesting $9000 in repairs, and I never got an accurate list or description as to what that entailed. We had just remodeled the house, so there was no reason for this excessive number. On top of that, they never physically came into the house to verify any necessary &ldquo;repairs&rdquo;.<br/>Approximately one month after closing, our home was listed by them for sale. They made a few minor cosmetic updates (ie painted bedrooms), but absolutely nothing that would have merited $9000 in repairs. They also listed it for $34,000 higher than the &ldquo;fair market offer&rdquo; they had given us a month previously, and proceeded to sell it approximately 2 weeks later for $49,000 more than they offered us, and $15,000 above their list price. They clearly bought the property to flip for profit.<br/><br/>I would argue that the amount that they should be fined should be much higher. In our situations, with the service fees, &ldquo;repair costs&rdquo; and the undervalued offer, we lost $69,000 to them and their deceitful and predatory tactics at the end of 2021, after they claim they had ceased to conduct business in this manner.",

They are forcing issues that should be discussed only in a family setting. This is gross overreach<br/><br/>The proposed regulations would harm children&rsquo;s health and well-being by supporting a lie. It is unhealthy for any child to think that their sexual identity is a question of a decision. God and only God decides if you are a male or a female. There are no other choices. Satan is the King of confusion. <br/><br/>The proposed regulations would threaten girls&rsquo; privacy / safety / sport&rsquo;s and academic opportunities.   Just a few years ago, a boy in our daughters class put his phone in the girls locker room and videotaped the girls undressing. This invasion of privacy left my daughter and many of the other girls feeling violated and traumatized. With the passing of the proposed regulation, it is an open invitation for potential harm to have these once private spaces opened up to people who may have wrong motives for being there.  It is dangerous  and unconscionable. <br/><br/>- The proposed regulations would infringe our family&rsquo;s religious liberties by imposing beliefs that go against everything that we believe as Christians. It is our belief that we are created in the image and likeness of God. Only God decides if you are a male or a female. It is not a matter that the school system should be involved in and certainly not without parental consent!<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>These proposed changes to the Title IX regulations would be so harmful to our parental rights, religious liberties, children&rsquo;s well-being, children&rsquo;s First Amendment rights, my daughter&rsquo;s privacy, safety, and sports opportunities that if adopted we would have to consider removing our child from public school [and we know other parents who feel the same]. <br/><br/>Money is allocated to schools each year on a per student basis based on the number of children enrolled in school. We ask you to calculate and take into consideration the economic impact of concerned parents removing their children from public schools due to these proposed regulations. <br/><br/>I strongly urge you to abandon these changes to the Title IX regulations.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Marianna Debus Mitchek<br/>",

    "text": "As a clinician who cares for patients who receive important care at rates determined by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, I am greatly disappointed to see CMS reduce work RVUs for cardiac ablation, pulmonary angiography, and pulmonary revascularization services below the values recommended by the American Medical Association/Specialty Society RVS Update Committee (RUC) in the 2023 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule. I urge you and the staff at CMS to reconsider the proposed work RVU reductions to these services in the 2023 rulemaking and implement the RUC-recommended values. After a year of devastating cuts to CV services, further cuts for 2023 are simply indefensible. We are currently facing record inflation, a continuation of the nationwide public health emergency, and significant challenges retaining our workforce. We urge CMS to re-evaluate their position and its harmful impact on patient access to care. We cannot sustain continued cuts, especially cuts that go beyond the RUC recommendations.<br/><br/>Beyond the troubling trend of ongoing reductions via conversion factor cuts (proposed -4.5% in CY2023), statutory cuts from sequestration and PAYGO rules, and a flat annual payment update that fails to account for significant inflation in practice costs, these specific reductions are an alarming and significant departure from the RUC recommended values. The RUC survey and evaluation process, in which practicing physician feedback is used to create recommended relative values for services, was in these instances disregarded by using comparator codes which are in no way comparable to the services in question. Despite the RUC process taking great lengths to recognize and adjust to the new efficiencies of these codes due to advanced technology that increases complexity and risk, CMS further reduced the RUC proposed values. <br/><br/>After the large reductions ablation services underwent in 2022 resulting from bundling of services and subsequent refinement of the work RVUs by the RUC based on a second work RVU survey for 2023, further reductions at the scale proposed are unfounded. Doing so will harm patients&#39; access to care and the clinicians who serve them. RVUs for these services were reduced 26% from 2021 to 2022 through bundling. Phasing-in of these reductions should have taken place in 2022, but did not occur. CMS&#39;s proposal for 2023 would reduce the same codes another 10% within a 12-month period, based solely on a desire to see greater reductions in RVUs commensurate with time that ignore the intensity and risk inherent in these services. <br/><br/>RVUs for these services were reduced 26% from 2021 to 2022 through bundling; phasing-in of these reductions should have taken place in 2022 but did not occur. CMS&#39;s proposal for 2023 would reduce the same codes another 10% within a 12- month period, based solely on a desire to see greater reductions in RVUs commensurate with time that ignore the intensity and risk inherent in these services. <br/><br/>Because of the concerns noted above, CMS should deviate from the RUC recommendations for SVT (93653) and AF (93656) ablation, instead using survey median values to set rates for these codes that align with more appropriate comparison services. The higher median values better reflect the skill, intensity, complexity, and risk of these services. The RUC recommended RVUs for VT ablation (93654) and additional ablation codes (93655, 93657) appropriately capture reductions in time while also reflecting the intensity of these services better than the CMS proposed crosswalks and should be adopted as the values for these codes. To make the work of ablating tissue inside the heart to control chronic rhythm disorders equivalent to the work of revascularization of a lower extremity vessel, as CMS proposes, would be improper and a distortion of the relativity of these procedures.<br/><br/>Pulmonary services suffer a similar outcome, where CMS seems to consider time without regard to intensity or complexity. In some instances, this was done when submitted materials included compelling evidence the services had changed from their prior work valuation and are now more intense. With new codes, the rule repeatedly states that values appear high compared to codes with similar times, making reductions appropriate. However, this fails to account for the increased intensity and work of these services versus the services CMS identifies, all of which are performed primarily in pediatric populations for congenital heart disease. <br/><br/>I urge you to implement the work RVUs for these families of codes as described above.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.",

    "text": "I am writing to oppose CMS&#39; significant payment reductions for physical therapy services in 2023. The agency&#39;s proposed 4.42% reduction to the conversion factor will present new challenges and exacerbate existing ones in the provision of critical services, compounded by the fact that reductions to payment for PT were implemented in both 2021 and 2022 as well. It is critical that CMS act swiftly to mitigate the negative impact of these cuts to the extent of its authority.<br/><br/>CMS&#39; proposal to reduce payment for physical therapy services by 4% in 2023 is disappointing and presents a growing and compounding challenge for physical therapists to accommodate dwindling payment within a shifting health care landscape and concerning inflation. Providers, many of whom are small business owners, are already struggling to maintain their operations due to stagnant or declining payment, without accounting for historic inflation rates or the ongoing COVID-19 PHE. Inability to keep these practices open in their current capacity invariably means that beneficiaries will be harmed.<br/><br/>If CMS continues these reductions in payment, it will undoubtedly hamstring small therapy businesses, particularly in rural and underserved areas, with resulting delays and disruptions to skilled therapy care. CMS must ensure that these cuts do not affect access to care, through a combination of aggressive regulatory action and collaboration with legislators. <br/><br/>I appreciate that CMS continues to consider and solicit information on potentially making permanent the change to the definition of &quot;direct supervision,&quot; which allows direct supervision to be met through virtual presence. I believe that it is within CMS&#39; authority to modify the supervision requirements for PTAs (42 CFR 410.60(a)(3)(ii) and (c)(2)) from direct to general for physical therapist assistants in private practice.<br/><br/>Amending the supervision standard for private practices will help to ensure patient access to therapy services, assist in navigating the long-term and ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide support for small outpatient therapy businesses facing annual and compounding payment cuts. Under Medicare, the level and frequency of PTA supervision differs by setting and can be superseded by state practice acts or local law where more stringent. Medicare currently allows for general supervision for PTAs in all settings except for private practice, which requires direct supervision. 44 states require general supervision, and the remaining six states have varied supervision levels based on settings. Aligning the Medicare supervision requirement with state law would provide much-needed, commonsense relief for physical therapists and physical therapist assistants in private practice. PTAs are licensed or certified in all 50 states and should be able to exercise their skills without needlessly stringent standards that disregard well-established practices. <br/><br/>I support general supervision for PTAs in private practice, CMS should, at a minimum, make permanent the current flexibility to allow direct supervision of physical therapist assistants to be satisfied through virtual means. Doing so would at least maintain the improved access that has been afforded to Medicare beneficiaries during the pandemic without significant drawbacks. <br/><br/>CMS established that it has concerns over the potential underutilization of high-value health services, particularly among potentially underserved communities. Underutilization of PT can be even more critical for individuals in isolated rural areas given the higher need for independent function and movement, which can have compounding effects on the cost of care across an individual&#39;s lifetime.",

It is my deeply held belief that there are only two genders. This belief is not grounded only in my religion but also in the most fundamental aspects of anthropology and biological science. I will not willingly subject myself nor any of my family members to conform to unsafe practices based on contrary beliefs. The idea that gender is a concept based on feelings and that a person may assume a gender other than their biological sex is not scientific. Moreover, I believe that it is immoral to teach these gender ideologies as fact to children whose minds have not yet matured to understand the difference between reality and fantasy. Let me be perfectly clear, these dividing and indoctrinating Gender Ideologies are purely fantasy and have no basis in reality. The reality is that those who identify by a gender other than their biological sex are experiencing a dysphoria. Encouraging any person that this dysphoria is the reality can lead to a state of psychosis and further mental disorder which is highly likely to cause harm to the individual and those around them. I will not send my child to any school which requires adherence to these regulations.<br/><br/>For the Department of Education, What will the economic impact of implementing these regulations be?<br/><br/>Please see the following studies:<br/>&ldquo;The hypothesis that gender identity is an innate, fixed property of human beings that is independent of biological sex &mdash; that a person might be &lsquo;a man trapped in a woman&rsquo;s body&rsquo; or &lsquo;a woman trapped in a man&rsquo;s body&rsquo; &mdash; is not supported by scientific evidence&rdquo;<br/>https://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy-pdfs/20160819_TNA50SexualityandGender.pdf<br/><br/>Real life victims of the transgender cult<br/>https://pjmedia.com/parenting/tyler-o-neil/2016/08/21/real-life-victims-of-the-transgender-cult-n107182",

    "text": "As an audiologist who treats Medicare beneficiaries, I write to offer comments on the Calendar Year (CY) 2023 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) proposed rule. I thank the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) for proposing to use its administrative authority to remove the physician/practitioner order requirements for certain audiology assessment services on a limited basis. However, the mechanism by which CMS proposes to implement the proposal creates administrative and financial challenges for audiologists that will undermine the success of the proposal. <br/><br/>Audiologists value care coordination with multidisciplinary care teams-including their physician partners-and are bound by clinical, ethical, and legal standards to do so. Removing the physician/practitioner order requirement does not eliminate this obligation to work as a team and continue to deliver coordinated patient care. In addition, audiologists are educated, trained, and qualified to provide a range of hearing and balance assessment services and do not require a physician/practitioner order under state law to safely provide these services to patients. As such, I strongly support CMS&#39;s proposal to remove the physician/practitioner order requirement for audiology services under its current administrative authority.<br/><br/>My primary concern with the proposal is the use of the G-code GAUDX, to represent 36 distinct clinical services for reimbursement purposes instead of using the established and valued CPT codes traditionally used by audiologists to report their services. The use of GAUDX would undermine CMS&#39;s stated intent of collecting data on how often audiology assessment services are provided without a physician/practitioner order. <br/><br/>Use of GAUDX also grossly skews reimbursement for these services, in some cases overpaying the audiologist for an assessment service (and increasing beneficiary financial liability) and in other cases underpaying audiologists for these services. In the most extreme case, audiologists would lose approximately $100 in reimbursement from using GAUDX for a single service. Using the CPT code that represents the specific service(s) provided allows CMS to accurately understand what types of audiology assessment services are provided without a physician order associated with a patient&#39;s diagnosis. In addition, using CPT codes and a related modifier upholds the value and integrity of the Medicare fee schedule by ensuring audiologists are paid on established rates, not an arbitrary value. I recommend that CMS utilize the CPT codes for these services at the established reimbursement rates and require the use of a modifier to help track when these services are provided without a physician/practitioner order.<br/><br/>While I do not believe access to care without a physician order should be limited to once per calendar year, I recognize that CMS intends a limited approach to the proposal. Limiting coverage without a physician order to CPT codes with a modifier on a single date of service would allow audiologists to provide the appropriate medically necessary services to Medicare beneficiaries and accurately reflect service delivery and reimbursement for those specific procedures.<br/><br/>Audiologists are defined as professionals with specialized education and training in the provision of comprehensive diagnostic and nonmedical treatment services for hearing and balance disorders. ,<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>As noted above, audiologists can provide balance assessments safely without a physician order and recognize the importance of coordinating with their physician partners-when the patient&#39;s clinical presentation requires it-for hearing and balances assessments alike. Therefore, I recommend that CMS allow audiologists to perform both hearing and balance assessments without a physician/practitioner order as needed by the patient. <br/><br/>Without adjusting the proposal to reflect the practical challenges created by the GAUDX code, CMS will not achieve its goal of better understanding the impact from removing the physician order requirement nor will it increase beneficiary access to care because using the GAUDX code will create too many administrative and payment challenges for audiologists.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my recommendations. Audiologists stand ready to partner with CMS to develop a policy that meets the needs of all stakeholders ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries receive timely access to audiology assessment services.",

    "text": "As an applied psychologist, I urge CMS to ensure that the final Physician Fee Schedule for 2023 utilizes findings from the field of applied psychology to improve equity in behavioral health care, particularly for diverse and underserved communities. In that spirit, I also urge CMS to work with the American Psychological Association (APA) Services to develop new rate-setting methodologies to improve access to behavioral health services.<br/><br/>Strengthen the Practice of Psychology<br/>BHI Codes <br/>I support CMS&#39; proposed coding and payment for General Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) to recognize psychologists&#39; role in integrated care. I appreciate CMS&#39; support for multiple evidence-based models of integrated care, as it allows psychologists the flexibility required to support the behavioral health needs of the broader community.<br/><br/>Medicare Potentially Underutilized Services<br/>I appreciate CMS&#39; request for comments on potentially underutilized services, as several of the services CMS identified are performed by psychologists. I recommend CMS create additional Cognitive Assessment &amp; Care codes without the medication reconciliation service because medication management is outside the scope of a psychologist&#39;s license in many states. Additionally, I recommend CMS allow reimbursement for Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity services provided by psychologists. <br/><br/>Chronic Pain Management and Treatment (CPM) Bundles<br/>I ask CMS to create additional bundled pain management codes that do not include medication management. I am concerned that psychologists would be excluded from this new bundled service because in most states medication management is outside the scope of a psychologist&#39;s license. Psychologists play a critical role in implementing non-pharmacological approaches to treatment, which may be safer or more effective for some patients, as well as team-based comprehensive pain management.<br/><br/>Telehealth<br/>Many patients in rural and underserved areas are now able to access mental health services, often for the first time. Additionally, many patients prefer utilizing telehealth for a variety of reasons. Reverting to a lower rate for telehealth services after the end of the COVID public health emergency will lead practitioners to offer telehealth less frequently or to restrict the number of Medicare beneficiaries they treat using telehealth.<br/><br/>Expand Psychology Training and Workforce Development<br/>Supervision by Psychologists <br/>I applaud CMS&#39; Proposed Revisions to the &quot;Incident to&quot; Physicians&#39; Services Regulation for Behavioral Health Services to allow for reimbursement for Physicians and Non-Physician Providers (NPPs), which include psychologists, who supervise these practitioners in their everyday practice. This will help expand access to and coordination of mental health services in rural and underserved areas where masters&#39;-level practitioners represent a substantial segment of the mental health providers in the area.<br/><br/>Advanced Psychology Trainee Services <br/>I urge CMS to allow for Medicare reimbursement of services provided by advanced psychology trainees under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. Although psychology interns receive extensive clinical experience prior to their internship, services provided by trainees under the supervision of a licensed psychologist are not reimbursable under Medicare. Without Medicare reimbursement of services provided by trainees, training programs lack a steady source of funding. <br/><br/>Support the Psychological Research-to-Practice Pipeline<br/>Caregiving Behavior Management Training<br/>I ask CMS to reconsider its position on the caregiver behavior management training codes. There is extensive empirical support for caregiver behavior management training and it is the gold standard treatment approach for several health behavior issues. Although the patient is not present when this training is provided, these codes have many benefits for the patient, including a reduction in disruptive and problematic behaviors for children with ADHD, improved weight management for individuals with obesity, and better management of patients with dementia.<br/><br/>Digital Therapeutics<br/>I urge CMS to accept APA Services&#39; proposal that would establish a new set of reimbursement codes for digital therapeutics-one for purchase of the device, one for patient education about the device, and two for ongoing management of the service furnished through the device.  Unlike the RTM codes, this structure reimburses for an active therapeutic intervention, as opposed to passively monitoring a patient&#39;s condition. A new set of reimbursement codes as outlined above will have a positive impact on access to treatment amongst patients who have limited access to traditional office-based treatment or who prefer the use of digital devices over a face-to-face visit.",

    "text": "As a clinician who cares for patients who receive important care at rates determined by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, I am greatly disappointed to see CMS reduce work RVUs for cardiac ablation, pulmonary angiography, and pulmonary revascularization services below the values recommended by the American Medical Association/Specialty Society RVS Update Committee (RUC) in the 2023 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule. I urge you and the staff at CMS to reconsider the proposed work RVU reductions to these services in the 2023 rulemaking and implement the RUC-recommended values. After a year of devastating cuts to CV services, further cuts for 2023 are simply indefensible. We are currently facing record inflation, a continuation of the nationwide public health emergency, and significant challenges retaining our workforce. We urge CMS to re-evaluate their position and its harmful impact on patient access to care. We cannot sustain continued cuts, especially cuts that go beyond the RUC recommendations.<br/><br/>Beyond the troubling trend of ongoing reductions via conversion factor cuts (proposed -4.5% in CY2023), statutory cuts from sequestration and PAYGO rules, and a flat annual payment update that fails to account for significant inflation in practice costs, these specific reductions are an alarming and significant departure from the RUC recommended values. The RUC survey and evaluation process, in which practicing physician feedback is used to create recommended relative values for services, was in these instances disregarded by using comparator codes which are in no way comparable to the services in question. Despite the RUC process taking great lengths to recognize and adjust to the new efficiencies of these codes due to advanced technology that increases complexity and risk, CMS further reduced the RUC proposed values. <br/><br/>After the large reductions ablation services underwent in 2022 resulting from bundling of services and subsequent refinement of the work RVUs by the RUC based on a second work RVU survey for 2023, further reductions at the scale proposed are unfounded. Doing so will harm patients&#39; access to care and the clinicians who serve them. RVUs for these services were reduced 26% from 2021 to 2022 through bundling. Phasing-in of these reductions should have taken place in 2022, but did not occur. CMS&#39;s proposal for 2023 would reduce the same codes another 10% within a 12-month period, based solely on a desire to see greater reductions in RVUs commensurate with time that ignore the intensity and risk inherent in these services. <br/><br/>RVUs for these services were reduced 26% from 2021 to 2022 through bundling; phasing-in of these reductions should have taken place in 2022 but did not occur. CMS&#39;s proposal for 2023 would reduce the same codes another 10% within a 12- month period, based solely on a desire to see greater reductions in RVUs commensurate with time that ignore the intensity and risk inherent in these services. <br/><br/>Because of the concerns noted above, CMS should deviate from the RUC recommendations for SVT (93653) and AF (93656) ablation, instead using survey median values to set rates for these codes that align with more appropriate comparison services. The higher median values better reflect the skill, intensity, complexity, and risk of these services. The RUC recommended RVUs for VT ablation (93654) and additional ablation codes (93655, 93657) appropriately capture reductions in time while also reflecting the intensity of these services better than the CMS proposed crosswalks and should be adopted as the values for these codes. To make the work of ablating tissue inside the heart to control chronic rhythm disorders equivalent to the work of revascularization of a lower extremity vessel, as CMS proposes, would be improper and a distortion of the relativity of these procedures.<br/><br/>Pulmonary services suffer a similar outcome, where CMS seems to consider time without regard to intensity or complexity. In some instances, this was done when submitted materials included compelling evidence the services had changed from their prior work valuation and are now more intense. With new codes, the rule repeatedly states that values appear high compared to codes with similar times, making reductions appropriate. However, this fails to account for the increased intensity and work of these services versus the services CMS identifies, all of which are performed primarily in pediatric populations for congenital heart disease. <br/><br/>I urge you to implement the work RVUs for these families of codes as described above.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.",
