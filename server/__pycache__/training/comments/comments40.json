The proposal generally would cover two categories of loans. First, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term of 45 days or less or loans with multiple advances if each advance is required to be repaid within 45 days. Second, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term greater than 45 days, provided that they (1) have an all-in annual percentage rate greater than 36 percent; and (2) either are repaid directly from the consumer\u2019s account or income or are secured by the consumer\u2019s vehicle. For both categories of covered loans, the proposal would identify it as an abusive and unfair practice for a lender to make a covered loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal generally would require that, before making a covered loan, a lender must reasonably determine that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal also would impose certain restrictions on making covered loans when a consumer has or recently had certain an outstanding covered loan. The proposal would provide lenders with options to make covered loans without satisfying the ability-to-repay requirements, if those loans meet certain conditions. The proposal also would identify it as an unfair and abusive practice to attempt to withdraw payment from a consumer\u2019s account for a\ncovered loan after two consecutive payment attempts have failed. The proposal would require lenders to provide certain notices to the consumer before attempting to withdraw payment for a\ncovered loan from the consumer\u2019s account.

    "text": "<br/><br/>Docket No. FDA-1998-N0880<br/><br/>Sunlamp Products: Proposed Amendment to Performance Standard<br/><br/>As the owner of a professional tanning facility, I am submitting these comments in conjunction with material provided by the American Suntanning Association. I am concerned that, based on my experience, many of these proposals as written will not reduce sunburn incidence nor optimize exposure levels for my clients. Specifically:<br/><br/>FDA 21CFR 1040.20(d)(1)(iv) introduces an entirely new approach for a Manufacturer-Recommended Exposure Schedule. I have several concerns with this:<br/><br/>(1) FDA&#39;s proposed &quot;Manufacturer-Recommended Exposure Schedule&quot; needs revision. This system is supposed to provide a recommend framework leading to an absolute maximum time (the Maximum Timer Interval) to incrementally expose a tanner gradually. I could not in good faith recommend the series of intervals FDA proposes to my clients, which call for 3-4 minute increases from one session to the next - larger incremental increases than what I would ever routinely allow a client and for which FDA has no data in an actual salon tanning unit.<br/><br/>(2) Eliminating skin types from the schedule is a mistake. FDA asserts, &quot;Skin Type III and IV can attain a tan with UV doses that are similar to what is needed for Skin Type II&quot; based on a small study done with non-salon equipment in FDA&#39;s lab (Miller et al, 2012). While FDA&#39;s effort appears to be in good faith, based on my professional experience with thousands of tanning clients, FDA&#39;s conclusion is false. FDA did not even test Type IV tanners in its study. What&#39;s more, teaching clients their Fitzpatrick Skin Type is critical in my business to teach clients how to prevent sunburn both in the salon and outdoors. For clients with Skin Type II it may take several sessions before they see any results (which FDA expressed it wants clients to understand, per proposed 1040.20(5)(D)5). Taking this tool away will hurt my ability to teach Skin Type II sunbed clients how to prevent sunburn.<br/><br/>(3) Tanning courses and session frequency recommendations need revision. FDA&#39;s introduction of a &quot;tanning course&quot; (&quot;the period of time over which a tan is developed&quot; which FDA says is typically 3-4 weeks) and the suggestion that two sessions weekly should be a maximum fails to take into account why and how most indoor tanning clients visit salons and how professional salons teach and achieve sunburn prevention.<br/><br/>(a) A client who establishes a tan and then maintains it would not be engaging in a new &quot;course.&quot; Almost no client starts, stops and starts tanning as a &quot;course&quot; six times in a year. Most tan about three sessions a week for four weeks, and then maintain their tan with differing frequency based on their skin type.<br/><br/>(b) Limiting a client to two sessions weekly will result in clients visiting more than one salon to get 3-4 sessions weekly or simply purchasing home tanning units, which FDA knows are associated with greater sunburn risk, both of which would increase variables between exposures and increase sunburn. It will also lead to clients requesting longer exposure times to compensate for having fewer visits, which is counterproductive to teaching gradual exposure and sunburn prevention.<br/><br/>(c) Instead of recommending 48 hours between sessions on the label, I suggest this recommendation: &quot;Allow 24-48 hours between sessions to prevent sunburn.&quot; That gives the sunbed user and a salon operator the information they need to properly space sessions to prevent sunburn.<br/><br/>(d) Recommending a maximum of 48-50 sessions (15kJ) per year isn&#39;t warranted. There is no real metric for how you have established this. The government does not limit bacon or tobacco consumption for those who choose to consume those products - both of which present larger risks than sunbeds. I suggest the following: A statement on the exposure schedule that says, &quot;Limit Your Total Exposure. UV overexposure is linked to skin cancer.&quot;<br/><br/>(4) FDA should not require salons to recertify equipment currently in the marketplace to comply with the new Performance Standard. This would be more costly than FDA estimates and would likely shutter my business.<br/><br/>Without the changes I have suggested, the combined economic impact of FDA&#39;s proposals as written would not prevent sunburn nor reduce exposure, but would eliminate more than 40 percent of my salon&#39;s total revenue and would not educate clients in an effective fashion. Combined with FDA Rule FDA-2015-N01765, these rules would eliminate 47-50 percent of my salon&#39;s revenue - which would close my business.<br/><br/>Please allow the American Suntanning Association and industry suppliers to work with you to improve your proposals.<br/>",

    "text": "We have been in the process of adopting for 4+ years from Haiti and have found the process to be most difficult. As we visited Haiti on our socialization visit for our daughter, we were informed by the creche that adoptions in other countries are expedited more efficiently. Kids are leaving Haiti to go to Europe, but as far as the US, its rare. This is very discouraging. The restrictions and regulations that the US puts on developing countries makes it near impossible. As a pastor, I am grateful for what our country represents. Our country has a long history of care and compassion for the orphan and widow. However, in recent years, I have found the bureaucracy surrounding adoption to be insolvent and, well, very unamerican. I am grieved as how your attempt to make the system better actually makes it more complicated for Haiti and agencies operating in Haiti to convey adoptions. Where my citizenship used to afford me many freedoms, it now, in terms of adoption, is a liability. Please consider how your overthinking of adoption processes actually complicates and prevents adoption. You have many citizens who are looking to you for leadership. Please do not move forward with this rule change. It is detrimental to those you represent and the orphans that they are trying to bring home.",

    "docAbstract": "The Department of State (the Department) proposes to amend requirements for accreditation of agencies and approval of persons to provide adoption services in intercountry adoption cases.  The proposed rule includes a new subpart establishing parameters for U.S. accrediting entities to authorize adoption service providers who  have received accreditation or approval to provide adoption services in countries designated by the Secretary which will be known as \u201ccountry-specific authorization\u201d (CSA).   Adoption service providers will only be permitted to act as primary providers in a CSA-designated country if they have received CSA for that particular country.  The proposed rule also strengthens certain standards for accreditation and approval including those related to fees and the use of foreign providers.  In addition, the proposed rule enhances standards relating to preparation of prospective adoptive parents so that they receive more training related to the most common challenges faced by adoptive families, and are better prepared for the needs of the specific child they are adopting.  These proposed changes are intended to align the preparation of prospective adoptive parents with the current demographics of children immigrating to the United States through intercountry adoption.   Finally, the proposed rule makes the mechanism to submit complaints about adoption service providers available to complainants even if they have not first addressed their complaint directly with the adoption service provider."

More to the point, though, is that the population of rodents has dropped significantly.  The evidence on which I base this statement is, of course, from observation and others&#39; anecdotes (their observations), not a controlled study.  However, the problems we once had with mice and voles have diminished pretty drastically.  As one of my neighbors said, if you get rid of the cats, you&#39;ll need a pied piper to get rid of the rodents that are now free to party.  <br/><br/>My understanding is that many shipyard employers and their employees value the cats both for companionship and as a means of controlling rodent populations.<br/><br/>With TNVR, the cats can be good citizens that contribute to the control of GENUINE vermin.  Please exclude ALL CATS from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)&#39;s definition of &quot;vermin&quot; in the agency&#39;s sanitation standard for Shipyard Employment. <br/><br/>",

    "text": "&quot;The moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.&quot;  Hubert H. Humphrey<br/><br/>1. The proposed provision on eliminating the treating physician rule in the evaluation of medical evidence is an assault upon the integrity of the community of treating medical providers.  Approving this rule would say in effect that treating physicians cannot be trusted to issue honest opinions regarding the functional abilities of their patients.  Then the provision implies that physicians that are employees of the administration who have never treated the claimant, never seen the claimant and whose employment security is based in part upon how many claims they process in a workday and even how many claims they deny should be given more weight in their evaluations. This would lead the evaluation from a science-based methodology to a political/economic one based upon SSA&#39;s subjective determination of how many claimants they can afford to award benefits to each fiscal year.<br/><br/>The disability evaluation process has evolved into a labyrinthine scheme of enormous complexity involving archaic rituals and its own peculiar vernacular.  It is already nearly incomprehensible to the claimant who is seeking to access his or her own money that was involuntarily taken from them every paycheck.  Most hearing concludes with an examination of a vocational expert whose testimony is based upon the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, which has not been updated since 1991.  For SSA to now declare that the opinion of the medical doctor who has been caring for the frequently multiple conditions that led to filing the application is not more important than a back-room SSA employee could seriously undermine public faith in the SSA.<br/><br/>2. The proposed rule revisions are contrary to Ninth Circuit law regarding the &quot;credit-as-true&quot; rule that provides that reviewing courts may affirm, modify, or reverse and remand with or without further administrative proceedings. 42 U.S.C.  405(g). <br/><br/>3. Further, regarding the &quot;Articulation Rules&quot;  that allow the agency to ignore without explanation certain evidence, the Act itself provides that if the Commissioner&#39;s decision is unfavorable, it must contain a statement of the case, in understandable language, setting forth a discussion of the evidence, and stating the Commissioner&#39;s determination and the reason or reasons upon which it  is based. 42 U.S.C.  404(a) (emphasis added). These proposed regulations are arguably at odds with the Social Security Act itself.  If a claimant cannot tell how the Social Security judge made his or her decision, and the federal court cannot tell how the Social Security judge made the decision, how is there going to be any meaningful review of those decision, to ensure that they are correct?<br/><br/>4. The proposal to eliminate the need to give great weight to &quot;Other Agencies&#39; Decisions&quot;, especially the Veterans Administration is also misguided.  When veterans are returning from combat with PTSD issues that are found by the VA to render them unemployable, it is confounding and contradictory to have Social Security then determine they are capable of full-time work.   In fact, you should adopt a rule stating that when a Veteran is found 100% disabled by the VA, or found to be unemployable because of his or her service-connected disabilities (TDIU), they are presumed to be disabled under the Social Security system. This would not only promote uniformity across federal benefit systems, but it would encourage efficiency and ensure that disabled Veterans promptly receive the benefits they have earned.<br/><br/>5. I do support the revisions that would permit expansion of the definition of an &quot;acceptable medical source&quot;.  This is in line with the reality of the modern day that most physicians assistants and many nurse practitioners have their own caseloads and are most familiar with the patient.<br/>",

Since indoor tanning carries a much smaller health risk than tobacco, how can limits in indoor tanning be justified?<br/><br/>Please work with the indoor tanning industry to develop standards that help prevent sunburn, but do no limit my ability, properly advised, to make choices about UV exposure in a professional salon for me or for any member of my family.",

    "text": "Docket No. FDA-1998-N0880<br/><br/>Sunlamp Products: Proposed Amendment to Performance Standard<br/><br/>As the owner of a professional tanning facility, I am submitting these comments in conjunction with material provided by the American Suntanning Association. I am concerned that, based on my experience, many of these proposals as written will not reduce sunburn incidence nor optimize exposure levels for my clients. Specifically:<br/><br/>FDA 21CFR 1040.20(d)(1)(iv) introduces an entirely new approach for a Manufacturer-Recommended Exposure Schedule. I have several concerns with this:<br/><br/>(1) FDA&#39;s proposed &quot;Manufacturer-Recommended Exposure Schedule&quot; needs revision. This system is supposed to provide a recommend framework leading to an absolute maximum time (the Maximum Timer Interval) to incrementally expose a tanner gradually. I could not in good faith recommend the series of intervals FDA proposes to my clients, which call for 3-4 minute increases from one session to the next - larger incremental increases than what I would ever routinely allow a client and for which FDA has no data in an actual salon tanning unit.<br/><br/>(2) Eliminating skin types from the schedule is a mistake. FDA asserts, &quot;Skin Type III and IV can attain a tan with UV doses that are similar to what is needed for Skin Type II&quot; based on a small study done with non-salon equipment in FDA&#39;s lab (Miller et al, 2012). While FDA&#39;s effort appears to be in good faith, based on my professional experience with thousands of tanning clients, FDA&#39;s conclusion is false. FDA did not even test Type IV tanners in its study. What&#39;s more, teaching clients their Fitzpatrick Skin Type is critical in my business to teach clients how to prevent sunburn both in the salon and outdoors. For clients with Skin Type II it may take several sessions before they see any results (which FDA expressed it wants clients to understand, per proposed 1040.20(5)(D)5). Taking this tool away will hurt my ability to teach Skin Type II sunbed clients how to prevent sunburn.<br/><br/>(3) Tanning courses and session frequency recommendations need revision. FDA&#39;s introduction of a &quot;tanning course&quot; (&quot;the period of time over which a tan is developed&quot; which FDA says is typically 3-4 weeks) and the suggestion that two sessions weekly should be a maximum fails to take into account why and how most indoor tanning clients visit salons and how professional salons teach and achieve sunburn prevention.<br/><br/>(a) A client who establishes a tan and then maintains it would not be engaging in a new &quot;course.&quot; Almost no client starts, stops and starts tanning as a &quot;course&quot; six times in a year. Most tan about three sessions a week for four weeks, and then maintain their tan with differing frequency based on their skin type.<br/><br/>(b) Limiting a client to two sessions weekly will result in clients visiting more than one salon to get 3-4 sessions weekly or simply purchasing home tanning units, which FDA knows are associated with greater sunburn risk, both of which would increase variables between exposures and increase sunburn. It will also lead to clients requesting longer exposure times to compensate for having fewer visits, which is counterproductive to teaching gradual exposure and sunburn prevention.<br/><br/>(c) Instead of recommending 48 hours between sessions on the label, I suggest this recommendation: &quot;Allow 24-48 hours between sessions to prevent sunburn.&quot; That gives the sunbed user and a salon operator the information they need to properly space sessions to prevent sunburn.<br/><br/>(d) Recommending a maximum of 48-50 sessions (15kJ) per year isn&#39;t warranted. There is no real metric for how you have established this. The government does not limit bacon or tobacco consumption for those who choose to consume those products - both of which present larger risks than sunbeds. I suggest the following: A statement on the exposure schedule that says, &quot;Limit Your Total Exposure. UV overexposure is linked to skin cancer.&quot;<br/><br/>(4) FDA should not require salons to recertify equipment currently in the marketplace to comply with the new Performance Standard. This would be more costly than FDA estimates and would likely shutter my business.<br/><br/>Without the changes I have suggested, the combined economic impact of FDA&#39;s proposals as written would not prevent sunburn nor reduce exposure, but would eliminate more than 40 percent of my salon&#39;s total revenue and would not educate clients in an effective fashion. Combined with FDA Rule FDA-2015-N01765, these rules would eliminate 47-50 percent of my salon&#39;s revenue - WHICH WOULD CLOSE MY BUSINESS.<br/><br/>Please allow the American Suntanning Association and industry suppliers to work with you to improve your proposals.<br/>",

    "docAbstract": "Pursuant to sections 1031 and 1032 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) (Dodd-Frank Act), the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is proposing to establish 12 CFR part 1041, which would contain regulations creating consumer protections for certain consumer credit products. The proposal generally would cover two categories of loans. First, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term of 45 days or less or loans with multiple advances if each advance is required to be repaid within 45 days. Second, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term greater than 45 days, provided that they (1) have an all-in annual percentage rate greater than 36 percent; and (2) either are repaid directly from the consumer\u2019s account or income or are secured by the consumer\u2019s vehicle. For both categories of covered loans, the proposal would identify it as an abusive and unfair practice for a lender to make a covered loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal generally would require that, before making a covered loan, a lender must reasonably determine that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal also would impose certain restrictions on making covered loans when a consumer has or recently had certain an outstanding covered loan. The proposal would provide lenders with options to make covered loans without satisfying the ability-to-repay requirements, if those loans meet certain conditions. The proposal also would identify it as an unfair and abusive practice to attempt to withdraw payment from a consumer\u2019s account for a\ncovered loan after two consecutive payment attempts have failed. The proposal would require lenders to provide certain notices to the consumer before attempting to withdraw payment for a\ncovered loan from the consumer\u2019s account. The Bureau is also proposing to adopt official interpretations to the proposed regulation."

    "text": "I have been suffering with severe back pain for the last 6 years due to a 42 degree curvature in my spine causing substantial muscle deformity and spasms, along with military neck, and a slipped disc that causes me severe migraines to the point of getting sick on a daily basis. I have gone through 6 week physical therapy programs on 3 separate occasions and do daily therapy exercises at home to strengthen the muscles in my back. The severity of my pain often causes me to miss work as well as limiting normal daily activities I can do with my 4 year old son. My spine specialist had prescribed me hydrocodone for the last 2 years in order to take the edge off of the pain...I suffered with this severe pain for years while trying to avoid having to resort to taking pain medication due to the risks that come along with it. I would only take my medication when I desperately needed it to avoid becoming dependent. I finally starting researching the internet about natural ways to control severe pain out of desperation to completely discontinue the use of pain medication and also find some sort of effective relief from this constant pain, which is when I came across Kratom. I read every article and piece of research I could find on this plant and decided to order a few samples from an online Kratom distribution store. I mixed half of a teaspoon with some juice and within half an hour my back pain was completely gone. Aside from the biggest feeling of relief I&#39;d felt in years, the best part about this was the fact that I felt completely normal! I had zero side effects and my mind nor body felt altered in any way shape or form. Since then I&#39;ve been continuing the use of Kratom, taking about 1/2-1 teaspoon in the morning just a few times a week and I have completely discontinued the use of pain medication. It has provided so much more relief than anything else I&#39;ve tried...it has given me my quality of life back and I&#39;m now able to do the things that I&#39;ve always wanted to do with my son. I have never experienced any kind of recreationational value from this plant nor have I experienced any side effects. I honestly feel like Kratom could change the life of many chronic pain sufferers and greatly decrease the need for narcotic pain medication. I hope that you see the amazing benefits this plant could have in the world of chronic pain sufferers and really weigh out the benefits of keeping this substance legal. Thank you for taking the time to hear my story out and for your consideration.",

    "text": "The Datz Foundation, a Hague-accredited adoption service provider, makes the following comments on the proposed regulations concerning intercountry adoption (Billing Code 4710-06, Department of State, 22CFR Part 96, RIN 1400-AD91)<br/><br/>Country Specific Authorizations<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The requirement for an adoption service provider to obtain a Country Specific Authorization (CSA) represents a hardship on United States Citizens proposing to adopt relatives.   This demographic comprises families and individuals of limited financial means.  Additional fees necessitated by using a primary provider with CSA would be an unfair burden on them and would have a chilling effect on adoption.<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Larger agencies will have the financial wherewithal to pay whatever fee(s) are required to attain authorization; smaller agencies will not.  As a corollary, there is a risk that one or two agencies will be granted a monopoly in a sending country.<br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The CSA procedure represents yet another unnecessary hurdle and layer of bureaucracy and regulation in a process that is already heavily burdened by bureaucracy and regulation.<br/><br/>Additional Training<br/><br/>Prospective adoptive parents are already required to take ten hours of training, much of it oriented toward intercountry adoption.  This is sufficient.   No amount of training will prevent unauthorized custody transfers, which are statistically insignificant compared with the thousands of successful intercountry placements which occur annually.<br/><br/>Foreign Supervised Providers<br/><br/>Adoption Service Providers do not have the ability to &quot;supervise&quot; foreign adoption professionals and entities.  Indeed, the concept smacks of interference and neo-imperialism.   Consider the reverse:  A U.S-based attorney providing adoption services would doubtless balk at being &quot;supervised&quot; by a foreign entity.<br/><br/>Compensation of Individuals and Entities in Sending Country<br/><br/>It should not be the role of the Department of State to determine &quot;reasonable&quot; compensation in a sending country.  Consider again the reverse:  A foreign consulate in Washington DC tries to determine &quot;reasonable&quot; legal fees of American adoption professionals or placement fees of adoption service providers.   Fees and compensation must be determined by the free market.<br/><br/>Submission of Complaints<br/><br/>The proposed rule would allow aggrieved clients to file a complaint directly with the Complaint Registry &quot;for action by the accrediting entity&quot;.   This contradicts generally accepted principles of conflict resolution.   Our objections are the following:<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>An aggrieved party should first present its grievance to the provider.  In many cases, a resolution can be reached without recourse to further complaints.  If no resolution can be reached, recourse to the Complaint Registry is appropriate.<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The accrediting entity&#39;s staff and resources would be burdened by frivolous complaints which could easily have been resolved by the adoption service provider.<br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The suggestion that a provider might &quot;retaliate&quot; against a complainant is offensive and imputes an ill will to adoption service providers which have previously been thoroughly vetted by the accrediting entity in order to achieve accreditation.<br/><br/>In short, The Datz Foundation opposes the proposed regulations and views them as an attempt, intended or unintended, to reduce further the number of intercountry adoptions.<br/>",

My name is Lisa Halford and I have started using Kratom recently to help with chronic pain from failed back surgery, arthritis, degenerative disc disease, along with spinal conditions too numerous to list. This plant has helped me to NOT have to take so much of the opiate medication that I am prescribed by my Dr. In fact it helps so much that I could actually see myself not needing to take the RX meds at all if Kratom stays legal. The only drawback is that my RX is paid for by my insurance and if I were to switch completely to Kratom I would have to pay for it out of pocket unless insurance would cover it. I am disabled and my sole income is my disability check from social security so unless more research is done and my Dr can prescribe Kratom I will just use it to help me cut back on my opiate consumption. This is truly an amazing plant and we the people deserve for it to be studied further as it can help so many people! <br/>Thank you for considering public opinion,<br/>Lisa A. Halford",

    "text": "1. Country Specific Authorization: I think that when an agency has Hague Accreditation that should suffice. In our experience they should add more accredited agencies that can work with all the states in the United States and that are acceptable to the local authority from the country of origin and increase the annual caps. In the state we live there were no agencies listed in the State Department page, as such we had to hire another agency that could work with the one on their list and that created layers to the bureaucracy already embeded in the process. The agencies on the list should be able to handle the whole process regardless the state of residency of the prospective adoptive parents. Simple is better and more efficient!<br/>2. Change Education Requirements: I think the participation in a foster care training is outrageous. In normal life when women are pregnant they do not receive any kind of psychological or experimental training to raise kids. They just receive health related care and updates on the stages and necessary information from professional sources, if they are lucky to have access to that. Remember that adoption is an act of love and I do not consider necessary that you need to play the foster parent role to be fitted. Remember that the longer the waiting to fulfilled unmet needs for the children, the more damaging it is for them than for the prospective parents.<br/>3. Child Care Fees Disallowed: Definitely not! The child care fees are fundamental for the basic necessites of the children in the orphanage or creche. I consider that prospective adopting parents should be allowed to pay for those costs directly to the orphanage or creche. Agencies can control that payments occur timely, but they should not handle them.<br/>4. Cost to Adoption Providers: I do not agree that you need to add insurance to the cost of inter-country adoption. Regulation should be drafted to include aid from international organizations to increase the efficiency and institutional capacity of the local ministries and agencies involved in the country of origin of the adoption. Timeline of the whole process should be significantly reduced. Bureaucracy is too big on both ends. Add technology to the process, too much papers are needed in print!<br/>",

    "text": "Thank you for reconsidering your decision to schedule kratom without public comment. I have read through a number of comments. While aren&#39;t many studies that confirm the anecdotal evidence in these comments, I hope that the 1000s of people who have shared their story give regulators pause when considering scheduling kratom. <br/><br/>I have never used kratom, but my wife used it successfully to treat chronic pain. We&#39;re a young family. I&#39;m 33, my wife 32, and our daughter 2. With the exception of this year, my wife had slowly deteriorated physically and mentally from chronic pain for the last number of years. She saw her primary care doctor countless times along with regular visits to the rheumatologist and other specialists.<br/><br/>Under the care of her doctors, she slowly but surely was prescribed a larger and larger batter of pharmaceutical medications. Sometimes, the pain would temporarily subside but mostly it stayed the same or progressed. Her mental condition was the most difficult for her and to see. Towards the end of using Lyrica, Abilify, Xanax, and a handful of other medications that I can&#39;t remember, she became agoraphobic. Her condition was wrongly thought to be progressing and was told to see a neurologist and get an EMG. <br/><br/>In truth, she was experiencing side effects from medications and then put on additional medications to address the side effects. It was a vicious circle that increased her anxiety substantially and, looking back, likely caused a psychosomatic increase in pain. <br/><br/>I kept looking for answers because I was losing my wife and was drowning in the pressure of being a caregiver to my baby, my wife, and as the sole breadwinner. Occasionally, my wife would be open to trying alternative treatments. One of them was kratom. We were thoughtful about her approach to using kratom including it&#39;s dose, what strains to use and when, and so on. Kratom is most effective in small amounts and kratom has a natural way of preventing you from taking it in large amounts, nausea and taste!<br/><br/>Are there people misusing kratom, surely. The people who are misusing kratom are mixing with it opioids and other drugs. Just as surely as people are misusing kratom, they aren&#39;t dying from it. They are dying from fentanyl, heroin, etc. and happen to have kratom in their system at the time. <br/><br/>Do people who use kratom often continue to use it for potentially indefinite periods of time, yes. There are counter examples though. My wife used kratom for a short period and the relief allowed her to the opportunity to get off all of her prescriptions medications. Kratom gave me my wife back. Her pain levels reduced substantially from her improved mental state and with some subsequent dietary changes her pain has subsided.<br/><br/>As to the people who depend upon kratom. It&#39;s important to point out something that you already know, that dependence and addiction are two different things. You and I are dependent upon water. We don&#39;t, however, exhibit the kind of behaviors of substance use disorder such as physically risky behaviors, isolating ourselves from important relationships, etc. Just as some people are on SSRIs indefinitely, some kratom users are too because they need the results that it produces.<br/><br/>Users of this herbal supplement can keep their tolerance low by changing the strains that they use regularly, an occasional off day, and other methods. <br/><br/>In short, kratom doesn&#39;t meet the definition of a schedule 1 drug. It has medicinal value and it&#39;s addiction potential is low. <br/><br/>My wife&#39;s experience with kratom and my own with chiropractic care, has led me to believe that regulatory agencies should to take an extremely conservative approach in regulating alternative health. This is my body and I&#39;m responsible for what I put it in it with some notable exceptions that endanger public health, eg. heroin, cocaine, etc. Kratom is a natural substance and with care can be a helpful supplement to many. <br/><br/>I&#39;m sure that there are people using all kinds of herbs irresponsibly thought not necessarily recreationally. I read a story about someone who slathered neem, used to clean teeth in some forms among other uses, all over his teeth and gums leaving it there for 20 minutes. At that point, he was desperately posting on an alternative health forum because the skin on his gums was peeling. I&#39;m sure he ended up fine, and hopefully he learned that he is responsible for his health and it&#39;s a sacred responsibility that should be pursued with thought and care.<br/><br/>I ask that you not schedule kratom since it does not meet the criteria for a schedule one drug and that, generally speaking, you allow people to take responsibility for their own health as they see fit.",

    "text": "Department of Transportation (DOT)<br/>Docket # DOT-OST-2016-0208<br/>RIN 2105-AE53<br/><br/>To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>According to the August 2016 AIR TRAVEL CONSUMER REPORT, mishandled baggage reports filed by 12 US Airlines, totals to 175,365 mishandled bags for that month alone. In other data from the Department&#39;s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), the top 13 U.S. carriers collectively generated over $3.8 billion in revenue in 2015 from baggage fees. If the DOT is trying to determine the appropriate length of delay within the statutory parameters that would trigger the refund requirement, this data alone should assist in making that decision. I understand in the past the airlines were facing high oil prices and low profits, but according to the data, that does not seem to be the case any more. If they are able to generate that much income from baggage fees alone, I see no reasons as to why they can&#39;t invest some of that profit to improve the baggage handling system. As for promptly providing an automated refund for any ancillary fees paid by the passenger for checked baggage. I believe if the baggage does not arrive with the passenger at the time of arrival, the fees charged should be refunded and the baggage delivered within the time frame provided by The Act. If this is not possible, than the refund should be issued to passengers if the carrier fails to deliver the checked baggage to the passenger not later than 12 hours after the arrival of a domestic flight, or not later than 15 hours after the arrival of an international flight. There should not be any extension of the timeframe, which I believe will motivate the airlines to invest in creating a system that can better process baggages. Now, having said that, I understand that the airlines are not the only factors in mishandled baggage. For that reason, I believe The Act should also allow the airlines to investigate and get reimbursement, if the airport or Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is at fault. Also, if the passenger checked-in later than the time frame required by the airlines, than the refund should be void, because sufficient time was not provided to process the baggage. As far as international flights, they should be considered the same as domestics. The reason being, a standard interline connection on a single ticket can make the process easier for the passenger, but in the case of a connection constructed by the passenger using two tickets can have a major impact on the travel experience. At the end of the day, the goal is to create a better experience for the passenger and not to make the airlines jobs easier. <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of my comment.",

It is not wise to govern every truck on the highway at the same speed this will cause a major cluster ,major back ups and perhaps more angry and frustrated people on the highways.It will cause huge delays deliveries and much more such as;  it will affect production for small companies to stay on top,  this will cause a setback and on time delivery for hot loads same day deliveries to our customers. Speed is important,time is money is our job to get to point A and B in a timely and I safely manner.  why not consider speed limiter for cars because as I travel across country I see more cars driving reckless and more cars in accidents then Big Trucks, so why is it that we have to consider a ridiculous proposal to limit every truck at the same speed.I want you to consider being behind an18 wheeler in the left lane he&#39;s running 65 mph trying to pass another trucks that run in just a little bit slower and it takes him 30 minutes to get out of the way and you in your car you have a emergency or you running late for something. It may be a case where a police officer, fire truck or ambulance and the truck doesn&#39;t have enough power to get out the way.  This proposal won&#39;t just hurt the trucking industry,but I believe it  affect everyone that used the highways as they way making a living and to do their job. so I vote for dismiss of this proposal.",

For both categories of covered loans, the proposal would identify it as an abusive and unfair practice for a lender to make a covered loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal generally would require that, before making a covered loan, a lender must reasonably determine that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal also would impose certain restrictions on making covered loans when a consumer has or recently had certain an outstanding covered loan.

The American Suntanning Association has requested, constructively, to work with FDA to fix these issues.

There is no science to support this blanket proposal. More importantly, there is no precedent for the federal government limiting consumer choice for any legal product - fast food hamburgers, bacon or even tobacco, all of which are on the World Health Organization&#39;s List of Carcinogens.<br/>- FDA-2015-N-1765 would require my clients to sign a consent form every six months instead of simply once. Requiring this to be done every six months would be an administrative nightmare, without serving any valid public purpose.

It would be unfair to require this for our business and not for the hundreds of products and services that present many more dangers than UV exposure.<br/>- FDA-2015-N-1765 also imposes a federal ban on UV tanning for those under age 18. If minors are prohibited from using indoor tanning salons, they will instead use sunbeds at home, in an unregulated and unsupervised environment, and likely tan more aggressively outdoors.

The proposed change would expand the current list of acceptable medical sources to include nurse practitioners, physician assistants, licensed clinical social workers, and audiologists. This change would allow us to use the evidence from these sources to establish a claimant\u2019s medically determinable impairment(s)."
