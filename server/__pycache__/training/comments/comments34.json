It is estimated that indoor tanning causes upwards of 400,000 cases of skin cancer in the U.S. each year.  In fact, using indoor tanning beds before age 35 can increase your risk of melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer - by 59% and the risk increases with each use. <br/><br/>I also support the FDA&#39;s proposed risk acknowledgement form that adults would have to sign before using tanning beds and booths.  Quite a bit of misinformation exists on indoor tanning and some people think they are safe and beneficial.  The FDA&#39;s efforts will help correct this misinformation and educate adults about the risks associated with indoor tanning. <br/><br/>Restricting teens&#39; access to indoor tanning and educating all users about the dangers of tanning devices are critical steps to preventing skin cancer.  Together with the FDA&#39;s final rule reclassifying sunlamp products and the proposed rule updating sunlamp performance standards, this proposed rule will make a significant impact in reducing the incidence of skin cancer in the U.S.  I urge the FDA to finalize this proposed rule.",

I try to buy the most organic products I can for my family, because I know that when I do, Im supporting an agricultural system that is good for our planet. <br/><br/>I believe that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposed rule on an organic research and promotion order (AMS-SC-16-0112) is a terrific advancement that will lead to more organic food and farming. <br/><br/>Organic demand is growing so fast because more and more families like mine recognize the benefits of organic. Organic provides a choice not only for consumers, but also for farmers and businesses. Young people who want to get into farming in a smaller, sustainable way can choose the organic path. Small businesses can get into the organic market and make a go of it. Organic is providing more choices and more opportunities for everyone.<br/><br/>The organic check-off model offers the smallest farmers and businesses the option to choose whether or not to participate. This program has been designed fairly to not overburden the smaller operators, while also providing valuable benefits to these smaller-scale enterprises. It would raise funds to finance more research and assistance for farmers wanting to go organic. It would promote the benefits of organic through public education programs, which would help small businesses promote their organic brands.

Apples are one of the most valuable of the commercially-grown organic crops in the United States.<br/>The Northwest Horticultural Council rejects each of the three foundational justifications given by USDA in support of the creation of a new federal intrusion into the lives of our organic growers, packers, and marketers: Domestic supply shortages, need for viable pest management in organic, and market confusion.<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Domestic supply shortages are best left to the private marketplace to sort out. If there is a sufficient price benefit given to producing organic produce, it will be grown. No federal marketing order will change this.<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The prioritizing and funding of needed research is better left to those interested in individual commodities. Why should money taxed of an organic apple grower go to research for organic row crops? Federal, state, and private systems already exist to handle the research needs of U.S. agriculture. For example, USDA&#39;s Agricultural Research Service, the Land Grant University system, and, in the case of our industry, the Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission, which is funded by growers.<br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We do not see the need to create a federal mandatory taxing mechanism for the purpose of &quot;educating consumers on the meaning of the USDA organic label.&quot;<br/><br/>We also think that placing the economic burden of this proposed order on successful commercial growers while exempting small organic producers is wrong. Additionally, we think the proposed governing structure is unwieldy and would be a lightning rod for future civil litigation.<br/>With the current Administration&#39;s drive to reduce federal red tape, it is unthinkable that this proposal will go forward in the absent of any established clear need. We urge its rejection by the Department of Agriculture.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>NORTHWEST HORTICULTURAL COUNCIL<br/> <br/>Christian Schlect<br/>President<br/>cc.

Therefore, labels will need to include the same amount of grams of sugar under each category e.g. &quot;17 grams of Total Sugar&quot; and &quot;17 grams of Added Sugars.&quot;  This will confuse food consumers.<br/><br/>If this label is implemented at the commercial beekeeping level it will begin the misinformation to food consumers that sugar is added to honey.

I try to buy the most organic products I can for my family, because I know that when I do, Im supporting an agricultural system that is good for our planet. <br/><br/>I believe that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposed rule on an organic research and promotion order (AMS-SC-16-0112) is a terrific advancement that will lead to more organic food and farming. <br/><br/>Organic demand is growing so fast because more and more families like mine recognize the benefits of organic. Organic provides a choice not only for consumers, but also for farmers and businesses. Young people who want to get into farming in a smaller, sustainable way can choose the organic path. Small businesses can get into the organic market and make a go of it. Organic is providing more choices and more opportunities for everyone.<br/><br/>The organic check-off model offers the smallest farmers and businesses the option to choose whether or not to participate. This program has been designed fairly to not overburden the smaller operators, while also providing valuable benefits to these smaller-scale enterprises. It would raise funds to finance more research and assistance for farmers wanting to go organic. It would promote the benefits of organic through public education programs, which would help small businesses promote their organic brands. And, it wont cost taxpayers anything.<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment.",

    "text": "Dear FDA:<br/>I oppose the proposed labeling change. I join with the Pollinator Stewardship Council, and the American Honey Producers Association, to express my concern of the FDA requirement of packaged honey to include a nutrition label listing both &quot;Total Sugars&quot; and &quot;Added Sugars.&quot; This requirement does not distinguish between the two sugar types. Therefore, labels will need to include the same amount of grams of sugar under each category e.g. &quot;17 grams of Total Sugar&quot; and &quot;17 grams of Added Sugars.&quot; This will confuse food consumers.<br/><br/>If this label is implemented at the commercial beekeeping level it will begin the misinformation to food consumers that sugar is added to honey. Eventually, it will create confusion across the honey industry and mislead the consumer about a natural product.<br/><br/>As stated in 21 US Code 342 (b)(4), &quot;A food shall be deemed to be adulterated... if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to...make it appear better or of greater value than it is.&quot; <br/><br/>If consumers are informed through the Nutrition Facts label that honey contains &quot;Added Sugars&quot; then consumers may be led to believe that honey is adulterated, by the regulatory definition, with sugars added to develop or enhance its sweetness.<br/>I realize that honey is added to foods in preparation or manufacturing and in that case it is clearly an added sugar in those foods and would therefore be labeled as &quot;Added Sugars&quot; on the Nutrition Facts label. However, pure honey, itself, does not contain added sugars.<br/>I share the desire for clear, understandable nutrition information to aid consumer choice and promote public health without confusion or misbranding around pure honey. <br/>As a beekeeper I encourage the FDA to consider listing the naturally occurring sugar content of 100% pure honey as a &quot;Total Sugar&quot; and not &quot;Added Sugars.&quot; <br/><br/>",

I certainly do not make my living selling honey but I find it disturbing that we could be required to include a notification on our labels stating: Added Sugars.  Honey has NOTHING ADDED!  It is the product.  In this world of people freaking out over organics and GMOs I believe it will only confuse them to believe we have added something to the product which is NOT the case at all.  I believe the public is looking for something pure and you can not get more pure than honey.  Please consider this carefully.  The public doe not understand the meaning of a statement of this nature and frankly I do not understand why this is even being considered.  Honey has been around since before Christ and the days of Ancient Egypt.  It is today as it was then - PURE.  The only natural food made by insects that we consume.  Pure- Raw Honey is just that.  Do not create concern and confusion for the consumer please.",

    "docAbstract": "EPA is proposing to add natural gas processing (NGP) facilities (also known as natural gas liquid extraction facilities) to the scope of the industrial sectors covered by the reporting requirements of section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) commonly known as the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (PPA), 42 U.S.C. section 13106. Adding these facilities would meaningfully increase the information available to the public on releases and other waste management of listed chemicals from the natural gas processing sector and further the purposes of section 313 of EPCRA. EPA estimates that at least 282 NGP facilities in the United States would meet the TRI employee threshold (10 full-time employees or equivalent) and manufacture, process, or otherwise use (threshold activities) at least one TRI-listed chemical in excess of applicable threshold quantities. NGP facilities in the U.S. manufacture, process, or otherwise use more than 21 different TRI-listed chemicals, including n-hexane, hydrogen sulfide, toluene, benzene, xylene, and methanol. EPA expects that TRI reporting by United States NGP facilities would provide significant release and waste management data on these chemicals to the public."

It is estimated that indoor tanning causes upwards of 400,000 cases of skin cancer in the U.S. each year.  In fact, using indoor tanning beds before age 35 can increase your risk of melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer - by 59% and the risk increases with each use. <br/><br/>I also support the FDA&#39;s proposed risk acknowledgement form that adults would have to sign before using tanning beds and booths.  Quite a bit of misinformation exists on indoor tanning and some people think they are safe and beneficial.  The FDA&#39;s efforts will help correct this misinformation and educate adults about the risks associated with indoor tanning. <br/><br/>Restricting teens&#39; access to indoor tanning and educating all users about the dangers of tanning devices are critical steps to preventing skin cancer.  Together with the FDA&#39;s final rule reclassifying sunlamp products and the proposed rule updating sunlamp performance standards, this proposed rule will make a significant impact in reducing the incidence of skin cancer in the U.S.  I urge the FDA to finalize this proposed rule.",

I urge FDA to adopt a final rule implementing this measure as soon as possible. Even infrequent tanning using tanning beds can lead to an increased risk of skin damage and cancer, especially if the initiation of tanning bed use occurs earlier in life. A large cohort study conducted in 2011 indicated a significantly higher increased risk of basal cell carcinoma for those who used tanning beds during high school and college as compared with use between the ages of 25 and 35, and that individuals who participated in only four tanning sessions per year were still at an increased risk of melanoma by 11% and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma by 15%. FDA must publish a final rule prohibiting indoor tanning for children under 18 as soon as possible. As scientific evidence indicates, tanning beds cause numerous adverse health risks, including cancer, and given their developmental vulnerability, many adolescents are not able to make completely informed decisions regarding the use of these devices.  Currently, state and local laws do not adequately protect children from the harms of indoor tanning and must be supplemented with a federal prohibition on their use under age 18. Parental consent/accompaniment laws are inconsistent with the protection of children from tanning beds. Data have shown that state laws requiring parental consent and/or accompaniment are not effective in preventing adolescent use of indoor tanning services. The FDA should not allow any loopholes to this rule that would allow adolescents to use tanning beds with parental consent. ",

    "docAbstract": "EPA is proposing to add natural gas processing (NGP) facilities (also known as natural gas liquid extraction facilities) to the scope of the industrial sectors covered by the reporting requirements of section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) commonly known as the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (PPA), 42 U.S.C. section 13106. Adding these facilities would meaningfully increase the information available to the public on releases and other waste management of listed chemicals from the natural gas processing sector and further the purposes of section 313 of EPCRA. EPA estimates that at least 282 NGP facilities in the United States would meet the TRI employee threshold (10 full-time employees or equivalent) and manufacture, process, or otherwise use (threshold activities) at least one TRI-listed chemical in excess of applicable threshold quantities. NGP facilities in the U.S. manufacture, process, or otherwise use more than 21 different TRI-listed chemicals, including n-hexane, hydrogen sulfide, toluene, benzene, xylene, and methanol. EPA expects that TRI reporting by United States NGP facilities would provide significant release and waste management data on these chemicals to the public."

    "text": "It is important for families like mine to be able to choose organic. That is why I am writing to let you know I support the creation of an organic check-off. I try to buy the most organic products I can for my family, because I know that when I do, Im supporting an agricultural system that is good for our planet. <br/><br/>I believe that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposed rule on an organic research and promotion order (AMS-SC-16-0112) is a terrific advancement that will lead to more organic food and farming. <br/><br/>Organic demand is growing so fast because more and more families like mine recognize the benefits of organic. Organic provides a choice not only for consumers, but also for farmers and businesses. Young people who want to get into farming in a smaller, sustainable way can choose the organic path. Small businesses can get into the organic market and make a go of it. Organic is providing more choices and more opportunities for everyone.<br/><br/>The organic check-off model offers the smallest farmers and businesses the option to choose whether or not to participate. This program has been designed fairly to not overburden the smaller operators, while also providing valuable benefits to these smaller-scale enterprises. It would raise funds to finance more research and assistance for farmers wanting to go organic. It would promote the benefits of organic through public education programs, which would help small businesses promote their organic brands. And, it wont cost taxpayers anything.<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment.",

    "text": "As an owner a professional suntanning salon, I am strongly opposed to these proposed additional tanning regulations.  <br/><br/>The proposed rules will actually lead to an increase in sunburn and skin damage if implemented as written. <br/><br/>I suggest working with salon owners and the American Suntanning Association directly to revise the proposed regulations to protect consumers in a more practical manner.  Specifically:<br/><br/>- FDA-1998-N-0880 introduces an entirely new, more hazardous approach for sunbed exposure schedules.  I could not in good faith recommend the new series of intervals FDA proposes for my clients, which call for 3-4 minute increases from one session to the next  larger incremental increases than I would routinely allow many of my clients and for which FDA has no data in an actual salon tanning unit.<br/><br/>- FDA-1998-0880 arbitrarily limits my clients to 48 tanning sessions a year and just two sessions weekly. There is no science to support this blanket proposal! More importantly, there is no precedent for the federal government limiting consumer choice for any legal product  fast food hamburgers, bacon or even tobacco, all of which are on the World Health Organizations List of Carcinogens.<br/><br/>- FDA-2015-N-1765 would require my clients to sign a consent form every six months instead of simply once. Requiring this to be done every six months would be an administrative nightmare, without serving any valid public purpose. There is no other product or service in the country, including the purchase of alcohol, tobacco and red meat that requires consumers to sign such a form. It would be unfair to require this for our business and not for the hundreds of products and services that present many more dangers than UV exposure.<br/><br/>- FDA-2015-N-1765 also imposes a federal ban on UV tanning for those under age 18. If minors are prohibited from using indoor tanning salons, they will instead use sunbeds at home, in an unregulated and unsupervised environment, and likely tan more aggressively outdoors. These alternatives would lead to an increase in sunburn and injury, compared to tanning at our salons that enforce tan time limits and other safety precautions.",

    "text": "Marie Dunne, Bearsville, NY USA Beekeeper for 2 1/2 years.<br/>A statement that you believe putting &quot;Added Sugars&quot; on the packaged honey label will confuse consumers and harm the market for honey<br/><br/>I, as well as other in the home-based honey industry, supports and applaud the FDA for its continued commitment to informing consumer food choices through the nutrition facts label.<br/><br/>Made by bees from the nectar of flowers, honey adds a hint of sweetness with a distinct flavor to beverages and recipes. <br/><br/>As stated in 21 US Code 342 (b)(4), &quot;A food shall be deemed to be adulterated... if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to...make it appear better or of greater value than it is.&quot; <br/>If consumers are informed through the Nutrition Facts label that honey contains &quot;Added Sugars&quot; then consumers may be led to believe that honey is adulterated, by the regulatory definition, with sugars added to develop or enhance its sweetness. <br/>Consumers will be misled to believe that honey is sweetened by adding an external sugar source rather than the naturally occurring sugars inherent in honey.<br/>There is a risk of consumer confusion if the nutrition facts label notes &quot;Added Sugars&quot; but a separate area on the label notes &quot;naturally occurring sugar.&quot; By definition, something added cannot also be naturally occurring. Our research shows that this will cause consumer confusion that hinders their ability to make informed food choices.<br/>We realize that honey is added to foods in preparation or manufacturing and in that case it is clearly an added sugar in those foods and would therefore be labeled as &quot;Added Sugars&quot; on the Nutrition Facts label. However, pure honey, itself, does not contain added sugars.<br/>We share the desire for clear, understandable nutrition information to aid consumer choice.<br/>Our desire, as is the FDA&#39;s, is to inform consumer food choices to promote public health without confusion or misbranding around pure honey <br/>To that end, we are asking that the FDA consider listing the naturally occurring sugar content of 100% pure honey as a &quot;Total Sugar&quot; and not &quot;Added Sugars.&quot; <br/>",

However, when the assignment is to use language to accurately label foodstuffs, blanket statements can be easily misconstrued. Such is the case in requiring honey labels to list &quot;added sugars&quot;.<br/>   Certainly the honey industry shares the nation&#39;s concern over sugar consumption and is dedicated to educating consumers about our product. Accuracy and honesty are forefront in our labeling strategies. By requiring honey packers to list &quot;added sugars&quot; on labels is neither accurate or honest.<br/>    There are foods that need &quot;added sugars&quot; and those that don&#39;t. This isn&#39;t rocket science and shouldn&#39;t be to hard to be fair and accurate to all. ",

    "text": "As a member of the Ohio State Beekeepers Association, I support the concerns of the American Honey Producers Association over the FDA requirement of packaged honey to include a nutrition label listing both &quot;Total Sugars&quot; and &quot;Added Sugars.&quot;   This requirement does not distinguish between the two sugar types.  Therefore, labels will need to include the same amount of grams of sugar under each category e.g. &quot;17 grams of Total Sugar&quot; and &quot;17 grams of Added Sugars.&quot;  This will confuse food consumers.<br/><br/>As a small scale beekeeper, this label language will not affect me directly in my sales at farmer&#39;s markets, and to individual customers.  However, if this label is implemented at the commercial beekeeping level it will begin the misinformation to food consumers that sugar is added to honey.  Eventually, it will create confusion across the honey industry and mislead the consumer about a natural product that is in actuality a healthier sweetener to add to food than processed white or brown sugar.<br/><br/>As stated in 21 US Code 342 (b)(4), &quot;A food shall be deemed to be adulterated... if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to...make it appear better or of greater value than it is.&quot;  <br/><br/>If consumers are informed through the Nutrition Facts label that honey contains &quot;Added Sugars&quot; then consumers may be led to believe that honey is adulterated, by the regulatory definition, with sugars added to develop or enhance its sweetness.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>We realize that honey is added to foods in preparation or manufacturing and in that case it is clearly an added sugar in those foods and would therefore be labeled as &quot;Added Sugars&quot; on the Nutrition Facts label.

    "text": "I am Opposed to the proposed check off rule. I have farmed most of my adult life and seen little if any benefit from the corn and soybean check offs. Very little money goes to research and what small amount does find its way there is controlled by <br/>large corps who will only let research that benefits their particular interests survive. I have farmed for 20 years as a parallel producer and was one of the first in my county to try RR soy beans. They only made 30 bu. We were told as soon as it hits the ground it disappeared. What a lie that was. I think 20 plus years is roughly the actual half life of glyphosphate. Lots of research went in to that decision to allow monsanto to get a strangle hold on the seed supply. I helped to get Midwest Organic Farmers Co-Op started, have attended many seminars and done tons of research and experimenting on my own. I bore all of those costs on my own to further my understanding of what I was trying to accomplish. The things going on at NOSB are appalling. The food corps have bought most of the organic processors and for the most part stick a label on it and charge more money, while constantly lobbying for the inclusion of any chemical that makes the product more profitable, not more healthy. The thing about organic production and processing is that we are attempting to build a sustainable system that also provides healthy food. This message obviously resinates with a huge section of the population. I see the word organic on every thing from plant mulch to gravel. It has come to mean something with the american consumer, all with out any check off money. I really cant see any benefit to pulling more money from the producer to do what he is already doing quite well on his own. I think most people think of organic farmers as backwards and uneducated. I use grid soil sampling, yield mapping, auto steer, and was the first in this county to plant variable population on corn. I have tried to stay abreast of technology and innovation and apply it when it fits. To me, this will only mean more intrusion into our management decisions with not enough benefit to justify the cost. I have been a certified organic farmer, every year, since 1996, I am 65 years old and seen a lot of garbage float down the river. I hope this sinks before it ever starts downstream.

Small businesses can get into the organic market and make a go of it. Organic is providing more choices and more opportunities for everyone.<br/><br/>The organic check-off model offers the smallest farmers and businesses the option to choose whether or not to participate. This program has been designed fairly to not overburden the smaller operators, while also providing valuable benefits to these smaller-scale enterprises. It would raise funds to finance more research and assistance for farmers wanting to go organic. It would promote the benefits of organic through public education programs, which would help small businesses promote their organic brands. And, it wont cost taxpayers anything.<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment.",

Families, like mine, across the country, value the opportunity to choose organic.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Its simple- we need more organic, not less. We need more organic farmers in the U.S. We need more public education about the benefits of organic. We need to make organic options more affordable and more attainable for everyone. Organic is the fastest growing segment of the food industry, and while local farmers and some of my favorite big brands offer organic products, fewer than 1% of farms in the U.S. are organic.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>I look forward to the Department considering comments from organic stakeholders. This program wont cost tax payers a dime and Congress paved the way for its creation with bipartisan support.  I urge USDA to move forward toward creation of an organic check-off in an expedient manner.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The organic check-off model allows for this valuable industry investment and creatively offers the smallest farmers the option to choose whether or not to participate. Im happy to see a fair program that wont overburden small farms.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>As a consumer, I support credible public education so shoppers understand what the USDA Organic seal means and why they should trust it.<br/><br/>I thank the Agricultural Marketing Service for the opportunity to comment, and look forward to more organic!",
