    "text": "I am a small-business owner, operating franchises that employ individuals in the United States. I am writing today to request that you amend the Final Rule titled &quot;Food Labeling; Nutrition Labeling of Standard Menu Items in Restaurants and Similar Retail Food Establishment&quot; (&quot;Rule&quot;) issued on Dec. 1, 2014, to provide for more flexible options for restaurateurs across the country. <br/> <br/>As currently written, the rule requires that caloric information be displayed on the menus and menu boards next to the name or price of the item. The calories must be posted in a type face that is the size of either the name or the price, whichever is smaller, and must be in the same color &quot;or at least as conspicuous&quot; as the name used for the item. Other information, including total calories, total fat, calories from fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, fiber, sugars and protein, must be provided in written form upon consumer request and noted as such on menus and menu boards.<br/><br/>This rule creates a one-standard-fits-all model that does not take into consideration the unique nature of the foodservice industry, including the hundreds of combinations of food items that impact the nutritional data. It also does not allow for a business owner like me to cure even minor violations without facing criminal and civil penalties. Furthermore, while the rule includes an exemption for operations with fewer than 20 locations, the exemption does not apply to franchisees like me who operate an independent business.<br/><br/>I ask that you reconsider the rule to allow for more flexible posting alternatives. For example, allowing employers to place information on one listing designated as the &quot;menu&quot; or &quot;menu board&quot; will lessen posting errors. Additionally, allowing for flexibility in determining which serving sizes are appropriate to be used (single servings, entire product or common unit of division) will limit errors while providing identical information to the consumer. I also ask that you remove the requirement that each franchise location have an employee certify that every food item adheres to the nutrient values as determined by the corporate entity. As a small-business owner, I have neither the time nor the resources to ensure that these qualifications are met. Finally, inserting a 90-day &quot;cure period&quot; for those who act in good faith and are non-compliant due to inadvertent human error would allow small-business owners like me to focus on running my business and growing jobs rather than living in fear of a violation.  <br/><br/>Thank you for delaying implementation of this rule so that FDA and others can fully analyze its impact on small-business owners across the country. I appreciate you considering my suggestions and am happy to provide further input as requested.",

    "text": "The risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for extended-release and long-acting opioids aims to reduce the serious adverse side effects that result from the inappropriate prescribing of these medication, failure to provide proper patient education, or abuse of these medications. Since long acting forms of these medications remain in a patient&#39;s body for a longer period of time, it is important to guarantee the safety in prescribing and use of these medications. REMS is intended to ensure the provider is able to provide appropriate patient education regarding the medication and has the education to safely prescribe. REMS also adds a medication guide to the patients.  <br/>Considering the increase in opioid prescriptions and associated abuse of prescription opioid, a revision of provider and patient education is warranted. Provider education can reduce harm by guaranteeing that providers are adequately educated to prescribe and educate patient on long-acting opioids. Even though this additional educational will provide continuing education credit, buy in from the organization and incentives are essential in order to ensure this education will be completed by providers. Equally important is public education on the risks of opioid misuse and abuse. Providing education to patients and the general public is also an essential component in promoting the safety and proper use of opioid medication. <br/><br/>Ray, J. (2015).

    "text": "This war on &quot;opioids&quot; is actually a war on  chronic incurable diseases.  A war on chronic pain disease patients who benefit from opioid medications.  Medications that enable millions of Americans relief of chronic debilitating pain associated with these diseases. <br/>100 million Americans have one or more chronic incurable pain Disease.  As the CDC, DEA, FDA, Medicaid and Medicare,  and numerous other government agencies, are blaming Doctors for the over prescribing of opioid medication.  NOBODY, is looking at or reading the statistics from chronic pain disease patients.   How about NOT addressing these drugs as dangerous and addictive.  When all else fails: physical therapy, exercise, over the counter medications and numerous injections etc, we chronic pain disease patients, are left with one option to help us cope, opioid pain medication.   Lets address this medication as lifesaving and medically necessary for the million of Americans with chronic diseases. Chronic pain is a disease.   Chronic pain disease patients are now the epidemic.   The addiction rate of chronic pain disease patients is .02-.6 %.  We do not misuse or abuse our medications.<br/>No other disease medication is scrutinized.  We, as patients, are being denied,  dismissed, overlooked and discriminated against, by our physicians, due to all the scrutiny associated with treating chronic pain disease with opioid medications.   Our Dr&#39;s are afraid to treat us humanely and adequately.   We have a disease that medication is readily accessible to us and we are being denied.   We, pain patients, are being discriminated against, due to people who abuse illegal heroin, illegal fentanyl and/or misuse opioid medication  and place the  blame on everyone but themselves.   This is a direct hunt for Doctors who prescribe life saving medication, for pain disease patients, that benefit from them.  We have our privacy invaded, we no longer are able to have doctor/patient confidentiality.  We now have insurance agencies,  pharmacists, and other government agencies in our physicians offices.  Monitoring and policing our physicians. <br/>Though the statistics show a reduction in, medically needed, opioid medications,  death rates of overdoses from illegal opioids is rising.  This system and laws are obviously not working.  <br/>The specific causes of deaths also needs to be closely investigated.  The opioid in the person&#39;s system needs to be specified.  Was it an illegal opioid,  was it opioid medication specifically for that person, was there other drugs or alcohol involved.  All these questions need answers. <br/>We have a chronic disease.  We want to be able to take care of our homes, our children,  our selves, as much as possible,  but without access to these life saving medications,  we are unable to do so.  We want to live, not just exist in pain 24/7.  <br/>We need the government agencies to look at the real statistics, not the hand picked.  These agencies are not physicians.   They are trying to doctor us, patients, without a medical license.   They are also trying to police our physicians.  This is a war on a disease, medications, physicians and patients. <br/>The statistics do not differentiate what opioid drug attribute to a fatal overdose or misuse of medication.   Was is an illegal drug, heroin,  illegal fentanyl,  carfentynal,  was that person&#39;s legitimate medication?  All these questions need answers.  The information needs to be addressed.  <br/>We need help.  All the headlines, topics and stories on how opioids are bad and how people are abusing, misusing, overdosing, becoming addicted or dying from them.  We need to look at the good they do and how they help our disease of chronic pain and the million of Americans who use them for some relief. <br/>The government needs to put the focus on illegal drugs coming into, being manufactured and distributed in this country, illegal fentanyl,  illegal heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and all other ILLEGAL DRUGS.  People who abuse and misuse medication, not prescribed to them, illegal drugs, alcohol, sex, whatever it may be, will always find a way.  Put the focus on that.  Not the legally and medically necessary medications we patients need. We chronic pain disease patients need help, but we are helpless due to the government and government agencies. There is stigma, scrutiny and discrimination against us due to a category of medications we desperately need and benefit from.",

I have anxiety too, but you cannot get help for anxiety anymore if you have pain, same goes for sleep. I consider suicide everyday anymore, my relationship with my 17 year old is going down the tubes and I have told him he needs to move out upon turning 18. I cannot keep doing for someone else when I cannot even get help managing my pain. I am 38 and I feel my days are numbered. I managed my pain over a decade with opiates, they gave me ability to function, and now my life really isn&#39;t worth living. I just need my meds instead I am treated like a junkie and I don&#39;t even drink alcohol let alone anything else!

He has been informed that none of this time is acceptable for him to test for an unlimited tonnage mate&#39;s license. Subsequently he must wait until such time that he has accumulated the full three years of sea time on vessels over 100 tons. This should be reconsidered. I understand that there needs to be unlimited tonnage experience, but there should be some percentage that is offered for this time. The time, experience and learning that is obtained during these periods on smaller inspected passenger vessels is not worthless and should not be treated as such. ",

    "text": " In 2015 there are since year 2000 almost 3 times more students in for-profit colleges. They make up 11% of all students in higher education, up from 3% in 1995.    This from the article &quot;8 Facts That Will Make you Think Twice Before Enrolling in a For-Profit College&quot; by Margaret Mattes at the Century Foundation. She explains:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&quot;For-profit schools using federal aid charge an average of nearly 80 percent more than similar programs at for-profit schools without access to federal aid. The average certificate or associate degree program costs about four times as much at a for-profit college than at a state schoola difference far greater than the amount attributable to public funding. The average cost of a certificate program at a public institution is around $4,000, while it is over a whopping $19,000 at a proprietary one. For associate degree programs, the average cost is $8,313 at a public school and $34,988 at a for-profit.&quot;    Students unwisely responded to false promises, and lost the deal, went into severe debt. The architecture of the entire enterprise was wrong to begin with. The oversight was poor if oversight even existed. Now the onus is on those who were victims. Wrong! I ask you to read the entire article, and consider who really is irresponsible. Additionally, the total household net worth, the sum of all private savings in the U.S., is $92.4 trillion, up 64% since 2008, a fact from the Federal Reserve&#39;s Flow of Funds report. We are a very wealthy nation, and we can afford to tax ourselves to pay for non-profit public colleges with quality vocational arts programs. The annual GDP, sum of all economic output in a year, is $19 trillion in comparison. Public services (water, roads, ports, airports, schools, and all the residual services such as insurance, financial back-stopping, financial regulation and monetary control) belong in the hands of the state, not in the hands of private for-profit entities.

    "text": "June19, 2017<br/><br/>Ms. Seema Verma<br/>Administrator<br/>Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services<br/>Department of Health and Human Services<br/>Attention: CMS-1686-ANPRM<br/>P.O. Box 8016<br/>Baltimore, MD 21244-8016<br/><br/>Dear Ms. Verma:<br/><br/>I am writing in response to CMS&#39; request for comments on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking CMS-1686-ANPRM regarding possible revisions to case-mix methodology for the skilled nursing facility (SNF) prospective payment system (PPS). While I understand that changes are needed to update the current SNF PPS, I am very concerned that patients who need occupational therapy services may not be able to appropriately receive them under the RCS-I proposal set forth in the advanced notice. As an occupational therapy assistant this can be detrimental to our facility. Occupational therapy in the SNF addresses critical areas of participation, mental health, cognition, social supports, and environmental demands. Occupational therapy practitioners also contribute to holistic, person-centered care as a key part of the coordinated care team to plan treatment as well as discharge planning.<br/><br/>I am greatly concerned that the proposed RCS-I does not include any safeguards to ensure that patients will receive the occupational therapy they need. Patients must have access to medically necessary services, especially the most vulnerable and complex patients who risk further decline or injury without such services. <br/><br/>Therapy services provided by qualified therapy practitioners are particularly at risk of being left out of the services provided to patients due to the limited clinical categories included in the OT/PT component of RCS-I. The functional and cognitive criteria may not be as robust as necessary to clearly identify prospective need and costs. RCS-I also may not fully capture mild cognitive impairment, which is encompassed in ADLs and IADLs. RCS-1 must be adjusted, in line with the IMPACT Act, to ensure attention to cognition.<br/><br/>Further there are no safeguards to ensure that a patient who falls into the OT/PT payment component will in fact receive both OT and PT as needed. As it is currently written, there are no checks and balances in place to ensure that the patient receives the services they need. At a minimum, I recommend that the revised payment system include indicators for services provided by each discipline in the discharge assessment as described in the ANPRM. For example, one therapy may be provided in exclusion of the other since the facility will be reimbursed the same regardless of whether they provide OT or PT services. Also, a patient may not realize that they are receiving restorative care when they actually need therapy under an occupational therapy plan of care. <br/><br/>Additionally, as an occupational therapy practitioner and a patient advocate for appropriate care, I am concerned that while a patient may be categorized in a PT/OT classification, they may only receive one therapy at the discretion of the SNF. SNFs must be held accountable for meeting needs and assuring optimal progress and recovery. Even more concerning, the patient may not receive any therapy at all since there are no safeguards in RCS-I to hold SNFs responsible for providing appropriate, authentic therapy.<br/><br/>Also, per reimbursement and other legal requirements including state laws and regulations, an occupational therapy evaluation is required prior to provision of therapy. Once a patient is classified in a clinical category by the SNF staff completing the MDS admission assessment, how will my OT evaluation affect the patient&#39;s payment group category to account for the occupational therapy services that the patient needs but were not apparent in the initial determination? More specifically, as it is currently written, the proposed payment structure does not take into account the clinical perspective of rehabilitation when determining the OT/PT payment since it is based solely on the admission MDS. Below is an example of a patient who could be overlooked and not receive appropriate occupational therapy under RCS-I.<br/>Another concern is that implementing RCS-I too quickly could cause great confusion in SNFs. Other payers, including Medicaid, may not adopt RCS-I quickly, which could lead to SNFs using RUG-IV and RCS-I at the same time. This would be complicated for staff and add to administrative burden. For that reason, I request that CMS complete a feasibility study to examine the impact of this payment system, especially the impact of the OT/PT component, on access to medically necessary therapy services. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on RCS-I in advance of a proposed rulemaking.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Amber Williams, OTA/L<br/><br/>",

In particular, we are seeking comments on the possibility of replacing the SNF PPS\u2019 existing case-mix classification model, the Resource Utilization Groups, Version 4 (RUG-IV), with a new model, the Resident Classification System, Version I (RCS-I).

They stayed with friends for 3 days; per physician&#39;s request.  <br/><br/>On the second day after RAI treatment, I became very ill and vomited on the carpet and bathroom floor before I could make it to toilet or sink.  I asked my husband to make contact with the on-call nuclear medicine physician and there was no answer.  He left several messages for a return call and did not receive one return call!  My treatment was administered by an acclaimed hospital who takes great pride in thyroid cancer treatment!  I was told to isolate for 3 days and throw away all towels and sheets in a sealed plastic garbage bag.    After the 3 days, my children returned home and life went on.  <br/><br/>However, what about the RAI I vomited on the carpet?  Exposure to my husband and children?  What about the RAI disposed of in the plastic garbage bags? I thought RAI had to be contained in lead containers.  How do I know I was at a safe level to be around my family?  I don&#39;t have a Geiger counter!  During my follow-up exam, I asked the physician why I could not get a hold of anyone, and he had nothing to say about it.   There is NOTHING safe about sending people home after RAI treatment!   There is nothing safe about sending people to hotels after RAI treatment!   RAI is handled sparingly and with much more integrity in countries where they know what happens after one is exposed to RAI!  We should take protocol from them!  <br/><br/>This has been an on-going NRC discussion for as long as I have been a thyroid cancer survivor.  I hope I live long enough to see a real difference made in our medical communities in regards to RAI and sending people home or to hotels.

    "text": "Extensive new Animal ID requirements could have significant impacts on our agricultural and food system!   I buy my food from small farmers who would be particularly hard hit by the cost and burdens associated with electronic ID. I do not want to see the farmers who provide healthy, sustainably-farmed food for my family to be burdened by unnecessary and oppressive requirements for the benefit of those who are exporting to other countries. A local food system is vital to our health, economy, and food security, and I urge USDA to prioritize the needs of small farmers.  <br/><br/>When the USDA adopted Animal Disease Traceability (ADT) just a few years ago, it committed to limiting its action to the issue of whether young cattle should be required to be identified when crossing state lines. This new ADT system is a breach of trust, going beyond the original agreement.  I oppose any requirement for electronic ID.<br/><br/>Electronic ID will suck the health out of the blossoming farming revolution, because it will be disproportionately expensive and burdensome for small producers like my family and friends.  <br/><br/>It&#39;s inordinately expensive. The profit margins for most livestock producers are miniscule.  A NAIS-type program means not only buying RFID tags (which are more expensive than the traditional metal or plastic ones), but having the infrastructure to properly place the tags, read the tags, and manage the data.  What a giveaway to the surveillance equipment industry!  And the tags have been shown to cause cancer!  <br/><br/>It doesn&#39;t address animal disease. Traceability does nothing to actually address disease. Sure, it is part of being able to control and limit the spread of disease once it happens, but the real focus needs to be on prevention!  If the government and industry spent even a fraction of the time that they have spent on NAIS on addressing overcrowding in feedlots, poor nutrition, toxic GMO feed, the overuse of drugs, and preventing imports from countries with outbreaks, we would have far healthier animals and less risk of disease in this country!  Plus, the food would be of much better quality for human health.  <br/><br/>This is an evil plot to skim money to boost industry profits on the backs of small and sustainable farmers!  The last time you were pushing electronic ID and tracking was about exports to South Korea and Japan, so big industry exporters could leverage foreign countries to open their borders to their products.  This time it&#39;s exporting to China, which already doesn&#39;t want our feedlot beef that is fattened up using toxic chemicals.  <br/><br/>Furthermore, the surveillance equipment industry lobbyists are behind this, because they stand to make huge undeserved profits from selling tens of millions of electronic tags, and from managing the massive databases that would be part of the system.  Multiple companies and trade organizations stand to make a lot of money from the program-at the expense of the vast majority of farmers and ranchers.<br/><br/>We don&#39;t need every animal to have a cancer-causing electronic tag in its ear, and its information entered in a database. What we need are programs that support independent producers, a vibrant competitive market, and healthy animal management to prevent disease. <br/>",

    "text": "I&#39;m a small farmer who is very concerned about Animal ID proposals because they tend to disproportionately hit small growers, disrupt local food webs before they have a chance to become established, and do nothing to prevent or eliminate livestock disease.<br/><br/>I live in a rural region that&#39;s trying to recover from the great emptying-out of a generation ago. People in their thirties are finally moving back to the land to raise kids and start ag-based businesses, including small pasture-based meat operations. I see firsthand how razor-thin their margins are, with a failed freezer or even a kid&#39;s broken arm meaning the difference between breaking even or needing to take out a loan.  In other words, they do not have the money to spend on expensive RFID ID tags -- to say nothing of the equipment to read them and keep records. Implementing RFID traceback would lierally put them out of business. It would certainly prevent me from even dreaming of raising livestock. (I raise row crops now.)<br/><br/>Scale matters. America shouldn&#39;t be a place where you can only have 1 chicken or 500,000 chickens. You should be able to have 80 or 800, too. Agriculture is the most fundamental of all industries, and it needs to continue to be a trade someone can go into with a borrowed acre, a cup of seeds, and a couple of ewes.  That&#39;s not out of some romantic ideal but out of a practical socioeconomic need for people with few resources to be able to support themselves, and earn a cash income, in rural America. If people can&#39;t operate small and mid-sized farms, we all lose.<br/><br/>That said, if RFID would make a positive difference in food safety, then maybe it should be required even if it annihilated a whole generation of fledgling livestock farms. But it won&#39;t improve food safety. It does nothing to control outbreaks, improve biosecurity, or patch the supply-chain problems that are the root of most foodborne illness.  It is merely an expensive, mandatory, technological add-on that will be absorbed effortlessly by the largest corporations, while handily eliminating their competition.<br/><br/>The social, economic and landscape consequences of burdening small livestock operations with onerous and useless technologies are unacceptable. Please forget all about &quot;improving&quot; animal ID and instead try improving hygiene and biosecurity (including antibiotic use!) in the largest farms -- the ones that account for the vast majority of foodborne illness.",

    "text": "I would like to tell you my story, so when you are training health care providers on pain management and safe use of opioids, you have some real world context.<br/><br/>I have had migraines for 25 years, almost ten of those years have been chronic migraine.  I put myself through graduate school with migraines, earned an MBA with honors (Beta Gamma Sigma) and had extensive plans for my career and personal life.  As of today, I have lost almost everything.  I have lost my ten year relationship, a meaningful career, most of my personal relationships and personal life, and the rest of my health and well-being.  I have tried 74 non-opioid treatments for my migraines, including a horribly extensive and disabling nerve stimulator implant that was ultimately removed due to MRSA.  I have other diseases, such as celiac, where I have had to dramatically change my life and diet, and have been successful, so I am not the kind of person looking for the easy fix.  And I am certainly not a drug addict.  I take my opioids only when I am in pain. Period.  My pain medicines enable me to work, albeit I work for my ex, who allows me a very flexible schedule.  Without medication, there is no way I could work at all.  As it is, I work or I am on the couch.  I don&#39;t really have much of a social life, and I save all my energy for my job.  But one thing I try to do every year is attend Headache on the Hill in Washington DC and Miles for Migraine, two organizations advocating for increases to medical research.  If migraine and other pain disorders had adequate medical research dollars, maybe all of us pain patients would have non-opioid treatments that worked.  I would LOVE to stop taking opioids tomorrow, and I will when something that works comes along.<br/><br/>I was first prescribed opioids twenty years ago - I refilled my prescription a couple times a year.  I have always known that opioids are serious, addicting medicine that should be used with great care.  I made a pact with myself twenty years ago that if I ever used my medication and wasn&#39;t in pain, I would stop using my medication.  When my migraines became chronic, I worked closely with my doctor, tried every treatment available, had a pain contract, did urine testing, whatever was necessary.  When hydrocodone was rescheduled, my injection treatments were taken away (they were always given in a clinic or ER setting, I was never prescribed injections at home).  I had undiagnosed celiac disease, so I wasn&#39;t absorbing my oral medications.  When the injections were taken away, I became disabled.  All of my doctors said they wanted to give me the injections, but could not because of government regulations.  I have never been prescribed more than 100 MME, which is what the CDC guidelines were supposed to be targeting.  Why was my medication decreased if I was well under the 100 MME limit of concern?  Has this lack of treatment saved lives or are more people now dying from illegal opioids?  What I am supposed to think when I hear about legitimate pain patients committing suicide because they are now in too much pain to live?  What is the point to all of this suffering?  Why are doctors being forced into watching their patients suffer?  What is a patient supposed to do when they lose their doctor or their job and have to start all over again demonstrating that we are truly in pain?  When I have to take multiple days off of work to suffer in bed in level 9-10 pain when a small pain injection could help me within minutes, what am I supposed to think?  Why is the government and medical community determined to make me more disabled than I already am? <br/><br/>Pain patients have so much stigma and disability in their lives.  Since we did not create the illegal addiction problem, please stop making our lives more difficult than they already are.  I am begging doctors to start standing up for their patients publicly.  Thank you.",

As a frequent traveler, I can aver that Aztec is the only place I have ever been where middle-aged people wear oxygen dispensing backpacks while shopping at Safeway.  It is the only place I have visited where nearly all of the High School students are afflicted with some respiratory distress or another. It is a place where long time cattle ranchers have given up the business because of toxic and unregulated emissions. Looking at the area from above, or considering the results of NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Lab study on the causes of the concerning Methane Cloud over the Four Corners the reason for the respiratory distress of San Juan County NM becomes obvious.   A 2 year stay on regulations to address these issues is needlessly detrimental to the health and wellbeing of communities in the heart of Oil and Gas country.<br/><br/>For several years the EPA worked diligently with the help of the public and industry stakeholders in crafting sensible regulations that would bring the Oil and Gas Industry into the 21st century.  Now, after a diligent and comprehensive process, at the behest of industry the EPA is considering a stay of the rule which would require Oil and Gas producers to protect our air and that of our children.   Specifically, a stay is proposed on regulations that limit fugitive gas, that oversee pneumatic pumps and that require certified Engineers to sign off on closed vent systems to comply with the Clean Air Act.  I strongly oppose this stay as it is myopic, anachronistic, and a cynical attempt to continue needlessly polluting operations at the expense of human and environmental health. <br/><br/>I oppose a stay on this sensible regulation because I believe that the communities which produce oil and gas deserve to benefit from easily implemented technologies that will have a positive impact on community health.  I oppose a stay on this regulation because Oil and Gas Companies should pay, as a cost of doing business, to comply with needed regulation that protects human health and the natural environment. I oppose a stay on this regulation because it takes the incentive away from industry to innovate and continue to lead the world in next generation technologies.  I oppose this stay because regulation will increase local jobs to ensure compliance.  I oppose this stay because certain states are already requiring a higher degree of emission control and monitoring while industry continues to thrive.<br/>Please consider the fundamental mandate of the EPA, the spirit and intent of the Clean Air Act, the health and well-being of impacted communities, and the natural environment in assessing this proposed stay to very sensible regulation.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Michael Carey<br/>",

    "text": "I&#39;m writing to strongly endorse menu labeling.  Studies have shown even nutritionists can&#39;t accurate estimate calories in restaurant meals and, as someone with a weight problem, I definitely appreciate being able to make choices based on knowing calorie counts of foods.<br/><br/>I am also a public health professional and as such, I know that preventable risk factors such as physical inactivity and poor diet have contributed to the obesity epidemic over time. Local health departments work with a wide range of community partners to create conditions and policies that help people make healthy choices, such as avoiding tobacco use and eating healthier foods. <br/><br/>Delaying the implementation of menu labeling denies Americans the ability to make their own informed choices about how many calories to eat at a time of high rates of nutrition-related health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, which add significant fiscal and public health burdens on the American public, businesses, and federal, state, and local budgets. <br/><br/>Studies show that providing nutrition information at restaurants can help people make lower-calorie choices and encourage restaurants to provide healthier offerings. According to the Food and Drug Administration&#39;s (FDA) regulatory impact analysis, the estimated benefit of menu labeling is $9.2 billion over 20 years: the total cost is $1.2 billion, providing a total savings of $8 billion over 20 years. A Harvard University study found restaurant menu labeling could prevent up to 41,000 cases of childhood obesity and could save over $4.6 billion in healthcare costs over ten years.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Given that the menu labeling final rule was stayed a day before the compliance date, all chain restaurants, supermarkets, convenience stores, and other food service establishments would have had to already have their prepared foods and menu items analyzed, their menus redesigned and updated, and staff trained. Delaying the compliance date is unlikely to result in any cost savings for them. In fact, if the requirements of the regulations are changed, it is likely that chains will incur additional costs. <br/><br/>Many national restaurant chains have labeled for years under state and local menu labeling laws beginning nine years ago with the implementation of the first two menu labeling laws in New York City and Seattle/King County, Washington with leadership from the local health departments in those cities. Food establishments have demonstrated that labeling is feasible in a reasonable space and at a reasonable cost without liability risks. A national poll found that 80% of Americans support calorie labeling at chain supermarkets, the same level of support as for restaurant labeling.<br/><br/>When drafting the menu labeling statute, Congress, advocates, and the restaurant industry all strongly agreed that menu labeling should be broadly applied to all establishments that sell food for immediate consumption. The FDA addressed concerns about covered establishments in the final regulations, taking into account different business practices and operations, including doing business under the same name and offering for sale substantially the same menu items, and carefully considered industry concerns expressed during the comment period. <br/><br/>Under the final rule, calorie information must be posted clearly and conspicuously for self-service foods and foods on display so that customers can use the calorie information at the point of selection.  Posting calories in a location that is not visible to people as they are making food selections would significantly weaken menu labeling, limiting access to and the usefulness of calorie information for consumers. The FDA has already provided considerable flexibility for labeling foods on display. According to the FDA&#39;s final guidance, there are several options for the placement of calories for foods on display. <br/><br/>It is essential for calories to be listed for each item as offered for sale. Without standardization, people will have difficulty using the nutrition information for menu items. Posting the total calories per menu item enables consumers to more easily compare different types of food items and determine how many people will share the item. <br/><br/>In order to protect the public&#39;s health, I strongly urge the FDA to revoke the compliance date extension and move forward with implementing the menu labeling regulations as finalized. Americans need calorie labeling to make informed choices. The final menu labeling regulations provide well-defined nutrition labeling requirements that are applied in a fair manner to all covered establishments and would provide accessible calorie labeling to allow consumers to make their own choices.",

However, once I read the docket, I have formed a better understanding of the situation. This proposed rule is to merely have a plan in place for when the president is there. This proposed rule will allow the community, both off and on land, to know what waterways they must avoid or the procedures to be granted permission to cross into the protected areas. I believe having this proposed rule in pace will be more beneficial to the taxpayers and citizens as long as they are properly informed when the heightened security measures are in place. It is much easier to enforce an established well planned rule than to fly by the seat of your pants at the last minute.",

EPA issued the final ELG rule in 2015 after an extensive rulemaking process, which included numerous technical and scientific studies and hundreds of thousands of public comments, the majority in support of eliminating toxic water pollution from power plants.<br/><br/>Affordable technologies exist today that can eliminate nearly all of this pollution - in fact, many plants are already using it, and the remaining plants must upgrade to these 21st century technologies. The standards finalized in 2015 were already long overdue and any further delay will result in more polluted streams and lakes that are unsafe for fishing and place additional public health risk on communities that rely on drinking water sources downstream of coal fired power plants.<br/><br/>I urge you to not delay any of the compliance deadlines for the final 2015 standards and guidelines for coal -fired power plants, nor propose to weaken any of the pollution limits required in these final standards.

As to additional time, we request a 60-day extension to submit comments, extending the current response deadline of July 31, 2017, to October 1, 2017.<br/><br/>Pure Luxury Transportation, founded in 1991, is a full service worldwide executive ground transportation company committed to perfection and superior customer service. Pure Luxury Transportation is also a member of the California Bus Association. As such, our purpose is to further the common interest in developing a positive business climate for motor coach operators in California, and to ensure that the motor coach industry is represented before State and Federal government on matters such as the aforementioned FMCSA docket. <br/><br/>My company has a strong interest in the FMCSA rulemaking concerning the L&amp;I rule. My company appreciates the Agency&#39;s notice extending the compliance date of the 2015 rule to January 1, 2019, and we are happy to see FMCSA taking the next steps to address the petitions for reconsideration. However, we, along with other members of the motorcoach industry, are confused by the Proposal published on June 16, 2017, and how it relates to revising the regulation. <br/><br/>Therefore, we ask that FMCSA clarify its actions to undertake revisions of the final rule by: 1) publishing a formal notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM); 2) including proposed regulatory text in the new NPRM, for comment; and 3) clarifying in the new NPRM the Agency&#39;s position with regard to the four categories identified as areas for regulatory revision, in the August 31, 2016 notice of intent. If FMCSA takes these steps, we will have a better understanding of how the Agency plans to revise the final rule and can provide appropriate comments, and hopefully not have to challenge it again. <br/><br/>I appreciate your timely consideration of this request in advance of the current July 31 comment deadline, and I look forward to FMCSA resolving the issues with the May 2015 rule. <br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/><br/>Gary Buffo<br/>President/ CEO <br/>Pure Luxury Transportation<br/>4246 Petaluma Blvd.<br/>Petaluma, CA 94952<br/>",

    "text": "I am a small-business owner, operating 4 Dunkin Donut franchises that employ 75 individuals in the state of New Hampshire. I am writing today to request that you amend the Final Rule titled &quot;Food Labeling; Nutrition Labeling of Standard Menu Items in Restaurants and Similar Retail Food Establishment&quot; (&quot;Rule&quot;) issued on Dec. 1, 2014, to provide for more flexible options for restaurateurs across the country. <br/> <br/>As currently written, the rule requires that caloric information be displayed on the menus and menu boards next to the name or price of the item. The calories must be posted in a type face that is the size of either the name or the price, whichever is smaller, and must be in the same color &quot;or at least as conspicuous&quot; as the name used for the item. Other information, including total calories, total fat, calories from fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, fiber, sugars and protein, must be provided in written form upon consumer request and noted as such on menus and menu boards.<br/><br/>This rule creates a one-standard-fits-all model that does not take into consideration the unique nature of the foodservice industry, including the hundreds of combinations of food items that impact the nutritional data. It also does not allow for a business owner like me to cure even minor violations without facing criminal and civil penalties. With today&#39;s demand to always change our offerings and keep up  with the always hanging day to day operations this can be quite difficult. Furthermore rule includes an exemption for operations with fewer than 20 locations, the exemption does not apply to franchisees like me who operate an independent business.<br/><br/>I ask that you reconsider the rule to allow for more flexible posting alternatives. For example, allowing employers to place information on one listing designated as the &quot;menu&quot; or &quot;menu board&quot; will lessen posting errors or a website to post new menu items that guests may access on their phone or other mobile device that it very common for an individual to carry. Additionally, allowing for flexibility in determining which serving sizes are appropriate to be used (single servings, entire product or common unit of division) will limit errors while providing identical information to the consumer. I also ask that you remove the requirement that each franchise location have an employee certify that every food item adheres to the nutrient values as determined by the corporate entity. As a small-business owner, I have neither the time nor the resources to ensure that these qualifications are met. Finally, inserting a 90-day &quot;cure period&quot; for those who act in good faith and are non-compliant due to inadvertent human error would allow small-business owners like me to focus on running my business and growing jobs rather than living in fear of a violation.  Putting the burden on the employer with no chance to rectify a situation and act in good faith is very concerning.<br/><br/>Thank you for delaying implementation of this rule so that FDA and others can fully analyze its impact on small-business owners across the country. I appreciate you considering my suggestions and am happy to provide further input as requested.",

Postponing and rewriting this rule will delay long needed reductions in toxic pollution to drinking water sources for communities and waterways around the country.<br/><br/>Every year, over 2 billion pounds of toxic wastewater is dumped into our waterways by power plants - the largest source of toxic water pollution in our country. This wastewater contains heavy metals and chemicals known to harm human health, like lead, mercury and arsenic. Approximately 23,000 miles of rivers and streams in the United States are contaminated because of this pollution, including many drinking water sources. Many of these dangerous contaminants become more concentrated in animals as they move up the food chain, which means the impacts to the ecosystem go beyond just aquatic animals - they can hurt or kill any animals that eat the contaminated fish -- including humans.<br/><br/>Power plants should not get a free pass to poison our water, food sources and our children. And the public should not have to bear the costs when public drinking water requires expensive treatments because of their dumping. The technology to stop these pollutants from entering waterways is available and affordable.

To not forgive those loans is to damage those students&#39; ability to live full and productive lives as Americans. <br/><br/>I am greatly concerned by the Department&#39;s support of universities that do not actually give students a chance to succeed, and are built on for-profit platforms. These schools go against the spirit of education in this country, a country that was built on the idea that anyone can work hard enough to achieve their dreams. By scamming their students they are profiting off the hopes and dreams and hard work of Americans who deserve better. <br/><br/>The borrower defense and gainful employment rules ensure that taxpayers aren&#39;t subsidizing schools that bury their students in debt for a useless degree, and should be enforced. Please don&#39;t waste time debating these rules and enforce the protections of hard-working Americans. Thank you. ",

Power companies have had two years to bring their plants into compliance with these new updated standards. Furthermore, this is only the latest in a broad effluent reduction that began with the Clean Water Act, and should continue if the water coming out of an industrial plant is as clean or cleaner than the water going in. This should come as no surprise, so why the power companies should be asking for a stay is, to my mind, infantile whining of people who do not wish to spend the necessary time and energy and money to enforce the globally necessary outcome. Once again, do NOT grant a stay on the compliance date. Put it into effect as planned.",
