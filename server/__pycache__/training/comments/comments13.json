This way, it would be easier for both the Consulate and the person applying for the visa at the time of the interview.  This would allow the all the security checks to be processed and cleared before the interview, so the officer at the consulate could determine a final decision during the interview and not having the applicant to wait for a long time.  The process of being waiting for an unframed time now is very frustrating.  Families are being separated and children are really facing a hard time dealing with the separation.  I am a wife whose husband is in Mexico waiting for a response. I am here with my two children and we just don&#39;t know how much longer we are going to be waiting for a response.

    "docAbstract": "NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 43.  In November 2017, NMFS implemented an emergency rule that set the 2017 commercial and recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for red snapper in the South Atlantic at 42,510 fish.  Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.  The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

    "text": "I am opposed to any regulation on bump stocks.<br/><br/>These proposed regulations would declare a bump stock to be a machinegun because it allows the gun to fire more than one shot by a single PULL of the trigger -- that is, by a single volitional function of the finger.<br/><br/>But federal law, at 26 U.S.C. 5845(b), defines a part as a machinegun ONLY if it is designed solely and exclusively to allow the gun to fire more than one shot ... by a single FUNCTION of the trigger.<br/><br/>To state the obvious, a finger is not the same thing as a trigger. And, while a bump stock is in operation, the trigger functions separately every time a round is discharged.<br/><br/>So these regulations are proposing a radical change -- as they effectively define a gun as a machinegun even if the trigger resets for every round that is fired, so long as the finger only pulls the trigger once.<br/><br/>While bump stock devices will now be treated as machineguns under these regulations, they also raise serious questions in regard to AR-15s and other semi-automatic rifles -- as they are now on the brink of being designated as machineguns by the next anti-gun administration.<br/><br/>In the past, one had to fundamentally change the firing mechanism of a semi-automatic firearm to convert it into a fully automatic firearm.<br/><br/>But now according to these regulations, a bump stock is a machinegun -- and it can &quot;readily restore&quot; a semi-auto into a machinegun, simply because the gun owner can effectively fire the weapon continuously with a single pull of the trigger. This would invoke the statutory definition for a rifle, which is classified as a machinegun (26 USC 5845(b)).<br/><br/>It wont matter that a gun which is being bump fired has not been fundamentally altered.  AR-15s will be on the brink of extinction once these regulations go into force.<br/><br/>These regulations dismiss Second Amendment protections, by appealing to the Heller court decision. But the Constitution trumps the Supreme Court -- so when the Second Amendment says that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, any limitation of the right for law-abiding citizens should be treated as unconstitutional.",

Under the current 2017-2022 OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program, lease sales in the Beaufort Sea are prohibited. Initiating the leasing process prior to the finalization and approval of a new 5-year program is reckless and premature. BOEM?s action to solicit industry nominations for new lease areas indicates that a decision to offer leases in the Beaufort Sea has already been made, rendering the public process that allows for stakeholder input meaningless. <br/><br/>The Arctic is one of the most diverse and environmentally significant regions on the planet. The region is home to many important marine animals, including beluga whales, polar bears, seals, walrus, migratory birds, and fish. Offshore drilling in this pristine environment would not only jeopardize sensitive marine ecosystems, but also the communities and species that rely on its continued abundance. There is no proven way to clean up oil spilled in sea ice. Unless and until we can prove that drilling in the Arctic Ocean can be done safely, it is a risk we simply cannot afford to take.<br/><br/>We urge the immediate reconsideration of the irresponsible 2019 Beaufort Sea Lease Sale.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Amy Graf",

    "docAbstract": "NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 43.  In November 2017, NMFS implemented an emergency rule that set the 2017 commercial and recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for red snapper in the South Atlantic at 42,510 fish.  Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.  The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

    "text": "I write to express my opposition to your March 15, 2018, proposal to weaken the critical protections provided by the 2015 coal ash rule. Below I outline how your proposal will leave communities and our environment vulnerable to toxic coal ash contamination and catastrophic spills.<br/><br/>GUTTING OF GROUNDWATER PROTECTION STANDARDS: I oppose your proposal to weaken the groundwater protection standards. Thousands of massive, aging coal ash pits are leaking heavy metals and toxic pollutants into groundwater. Coal ash dumping has led to water contamination and disastrous coal ash spills. Your proposal to allow states and polluters to use &quot;alternative&quot; groundwater protection standards for determining when cleanup is required will only enable states and polluters to hide the truth about contamination.<br/><br/>GUTTING OF GROUNDWATER MONITORING REQUIREMENTS: The public deserves to know if coal ash dumps in their communities are contaminating groundwater.  The groundwater monitoring requirements are vitally important to the more than 15 million households in the U.S. that rely on private wells for drinking water. It&#39;s unconscionable to allow polluters to decide when groundwater monitoring should stop.  <br/><br/>GUTTING OF CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS: Empowering polluters to avoid cleanup will result in ongoing water contamination. Allowing states or the owners of leaking dumps to determine whether cleanup or closure is necessary is dangerous. Coal ash is toxic, and weakening current standards to match those of town dumps endangers all communities that are near coal ash ponds and landfills. And just because a coal ash dump is no longer receiving waste doesn&#39;t mean that it no longer poses a threat to health and the environment. I oppose your proposal to treat coal ash like household garbage and to reduce the 30-year post-closure monitoring period for dumps that are no longer receiving waste.  <br/><br/>GUTTING OF LOCATION RESTRICTIONS: Prohibitions on dumping coal ash in groundwater, wetlands, floodplains, fault zones, seismic zones and unstable areas are commonsense requirements that prevent water contamination. I oppose your proposal to give states and polluters the discretion to ignore crucial and life-saving location prohibitions (and to do so without public notification or oversight), and reject any extension of the October 2018 deadline to comply with these requirements. <br/><br/>GUTTING CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR LEAKING UNLINED DUMPS: I strongly oppose your proposal to give states and polluters the discretion not to close or retrofit dangerous leaking unlined pits. If these leaking dumps are allowed to operate, they will keep polluting our drinking water and waterways and continue to threaten catastrophic spills. <br/><br/>THE EPAS CURRENT RULEMAKING PROCESS IS FLAWED AND LIMITS PUBLIC INPUT: The EPA has failed to consider widespread evidence of overwhelming groundwater contamination before proposing to weaken the coal ash rule. Industry data shows arsenic in groundwater near ash dumps exceeds federal drinking water standards at most plants. Dangerous levels of lead, thallium, selenium or radium are also very common.  Moreover, 45 days is far too short a time for the public to provide meaningful comment. By failing to hold any field hearings in impacted communities, the EPA is silencing the voices of those directly harmed. <br/><br/>I urge you to protect us from coal ash and preserve all of the minimum protections provided by the 2015 coal ash rule. <br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Julie Alley",

    "text": "I write to express my opposition to your March 15, 2018, proposal to weaken the critical protections provided by the 2015 coal ash rule. Below I outline how your proposal will leave communities and our environment vulnerable to toxic coal ash contamination and catastrophic spills.<br/><br/>GUTTING OF GROUNDWATER PROTECTION STANDARDS: I oppose your proposal to weaken the groundwater protection standards. Thousands of massive, aging coal ash pits are leaking heavy metals and toxic pollutants into groundwater. Coal ash dumping has led to water contamination and disastrous coal ash spills. Your proposal to allow states and polluters to use &quot;alternative&quot; groundwater protection standards for determining when cleanup is required will only enable states and polluters to hide the truth about contamination.<br/><br/>GUTTING OF GROUNDWATER MONITORING REQUIREMENTS: The public deserves to know if coal ash dumps in their communities are contaminating groundwater.  The groundwater monitoring requirements are vitally important to the more than 15 million households in the U.S. that rely on private wells for drinking water. It&#39;s unconscionable to allow polluters to decide when groundwater monitoring should stop.  <br/><br/>GUTTING OF CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS: Empowering polluters to avoid cleanup will result in ongoing water contamination. Allowing states or the owners of leaking dumps to determine whether cleanup or closure is necessary is dangerous. Coal ash is toxic, and weakening current standards to match those of town dumps endangers all communities that are near coal ash ponds and landfills. And just because a coal ash dump is no longer receiving waste doesn&#39;t mean that it no longer poses a threat to health and the environment. I oppose your proposal to treat coal ash like household garbage and to reduce the 30-year post-closure monitoring period for dumps that are no longer receiving waste.  <br/><br/>GUTTING OF LOCATION RESTRICTIONS: Prohibitions on dumping coal ash in groundwater, wetlands, floodplains, fault zones, seismic zones and unstable areas are commonsense requirements that prevent water contamination. I oppose your proposal to give states and polluters the discretion to ignore crucial and life-saving location prohibitions (and to do so without public notification or oversight), and reject any extension of the October 2018 deadline to comply with these requirements. <br/><br/>GUTTING CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR LEAKING UNLINED DUMPS: I strongly oppose your proposal to give states and polluters the discretion not to close or retrofit dangerous leaking unlined pits. If these leaking dumps are allowed to operate, they will keep polluting our drinking water and waterways and continue to threaten catastrophic spills. <br/><br/>THE EPAS CURRENT RULEMAKING PROCESS IS FLAWED AND LIMITS PUBLIC INPUT: The EPA has failed to consider widespread evidence of overwhelming groundwater contamination before proposing to weaken the coal ash rule. Industry data shows arsenic in groundwater near ash dumps exceeds federal drinking water standards at most plants. Dangerous levels of lead, thallium, selenium or radium are also very common.  Moreover, 45 days is far too short a time for the public to provide meaningful comment. By failing to hold any field hearings in impacted communities, the EPA is silencing the voices of those directly harmed. <br/><br/>I urge you to protect us from coal ash and preserve all of the minimum protections provided by the 2015 coal ash rule. <br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Karen Shample",

    "text": "I am writing today in regard to the EPA&#39;s proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, as the proposed regulatory change of the CPP is grounded in shaky legal ground and a loose interpretation of facts.<br/> <br/>The proposed change stems from Executive Order 13783, which mandates a review of all federal regulations that &quot;potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources and appropriately suspend... those that unduly burden the development of domestic energy resources beyond the degree necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law&quot;.<br/><br/>First, the proposed rule is ignoring the importance of the CPP to the public interest. Climate change is a real and ongoing phenomenon that is caused by human-induced emissions into the atmosphere, largely from carbon dioxide. The science is settled on this. The large concern is how much it will impact the world&#39;s agricultural system, water reserves, ecosystems, and longevity. The degree of impact is still largely dependent on how much nations and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. To avoid cataclysmic potentials of climate change, we must stop emitting carbon dioxide. The problem is how rapidly. Repealing the CPP would delay this necessary shift to renewable energies to the future, which will not only jeopardize the future public health of the nation, but also the economy of the future when the US is finally, and rapidly, forced to adjust its power sources to renewables. <br/><br/>Second, the reasoning behind this repeal is based on faulty economic logic. The EPA claims that, under the new calculations the current administration has used, the repeal of the CPP will reduce costs of compliance by $33 Billion by 2030. I would like to address several issues with this. First, this cost is minimal compared to the overall scale of the economic growth by the year 2030. Assuming GDP stays at its current level of 18.5 trillion for GDP until 2030, this cost is around one one- hundredth of one percent of the economy. This is not an amount that unduly impedes the economic engine of the US, and thus not a good case to call for a repeal. Second, the cost of climate change is something that will affect all economies well beyond the year 2030, thus such a cost-benefit analysis ignores the geologic time scale the climate change will be impacting. Finally, I believe the cost of the human welfare into dollars and cents is not an effective way to assess the impact climate change will have. While a cost-benefit analysis is always something to consider, I do not believe that the subjective analysis preformed outweighs the physical trauma that repealing the CPP will impose in the future. <br/><br/>Lastly, I would like to comment on the legal grounds of the EPA&#39;s repeal of the CPP. The administrator claims that the Clean Power Plan would be an overreach of the EPA&#39;s regulative authority by &quot;forcing&quot; power utilities to invest in different sources of electricity to reach compliance of the CPP, and thus a repeal of the regulation is necessary. This seems like an arbitrary view of the agency&#39;s authority. With the logic proposed by the administrator, the EPA&#39;s allowance of credit exchanges for wetland mitigation banks or sulfur dioxide emissions could also be considered &quot;outside-the-fence regulation&quot;. These programs are causing utilities to engage in mitigative strategies outside of their own facilities or properties to come into compliance with the EPA&#39;s regulations. If these programs are not considered to be &quot;outside-the-fence&quot;, then neither should the CPP. <br/><br/>I hope that my comments are headed along with the thousands of concerned Americans who are concerned about the facts and logic the proposed repeal relies on, and would also appreciate a tolerable climate by the year 2100. <br/>",

Other estimates suggest that a single little brown bat can consume 4 to 8 g of insects each night during the active season. clearly show how bats have enormous potential to influence the economics of agriculture and forestry. <br/>VALUE OF BATS agriculture industry. is estimated nearly $23 billion per year, but may range from $3.7 billion to $53 billion a year. Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) form enormous summer breeding colonies, mostly in caves and under bridges, in south-central Texas and northern Mexico. Their prey includes several species of adult insects whose larvae are known to be important agricultural pests, including the corn earworm or cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa zea).<br/>VALUE OF BATS;  as beneficial pollinators  Fruit-eating bats are sometimes called the farmers of the tropics because they are incredibly efficient at dispersing seeds.   While some bats provide pest control, nectar-feeding pats act as beneficial pollinators. Giant cacti and agave are just two types of plants that depend on bats for pollination, and in the tropics, over 500 different types of tropical plants are pollinated by bats every year.  <br/>VALUE OF BATS TO FOREST:  Theyre especially essential to regenerating clear-cut forests, which requires seeds to be dropped over large, open spaces . <br/>VALUE OF BATS FOR REDUCED PESTICDES , pest suppression services provided by bats ranges from about $12 to $173/acre (with a most likely scenario of $74/acre) in a cotton-dominated agricultural landscape in south-central Texas.  Means less Pesticides and chemicals on the crops that are not needed to suppress the insects consumed by bats which also reduces impacts of PESTICIDES on ecosystems, which can be substantial. Plus,  reducing the potential for evolved resistance of insects to PESTICIDS ,,,and genetically modified crops,,,,,. , Without bats, crop yields are affected. Pesticide applications go up.  bats can exert top down suppression of forest insects. The researchers noted that bats suppress pest-associated fungal growth and mycotoxin in corn as well as increased crop yield by 1.4 percent, which adds up to a difference of more than $3 an acre. study found that bats save farmers more than $1 billion worldwide  and thats only for corn crops.<br/>BATS VALUE as pest control for cotton production in an eight-county region in south-central Texas. Calculations show an annual value of $741 000 per year, with a range of $121 000$1 725 000, compared to a $4.6$6.4 million per year annual cotton harvest. Bats feed on some of the most damaging crop pests  including the moths of cutworms and armyworms  which helps to protect food crops naturally.

Industry data shows arsenic in groundwater near ash dumps exceeds federal drinking water standards at most plants. Dangerous levels of lead, thallium, selenium or radium are also very common.  Moreover, 45 days is far too short a time for the public to provide meaningful comment. By failing to hold any field hearings in impacted communities, the EPA is silencing the voices of those directly harmed. <br/><br/>I urge you to protect Americans from coal ash and preserve all of the minimum protections provided by the 2015 coal ash rule.<br/><br/>You can do this now. <br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Suzanne Guerra",

The scoping process and draft EIS are intended to determine if the suite of existing measures are the best means of achieving the current management objectives and providing flexibility to adapt to fishing variability in the future, consistent with the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA), and other relevant Federal laws.  NMFS is also announcing the availability of a scoping document describing potential measures for inclusion in a future regulatory amendment.  NMFS will hold scoping meetings to gather public comment on potential management options for area based and weak hook requirements.  The time and location details of the scoping meetings are available in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this notice.  NMFS is requesting comments on this NOI and the management of Atlantic bluefin tuna, which includes management options that are described in the scoping document, and relevant options that would meet the purpose and need for this action."

    "text": "I write to express my opposition to your March 15, 2018, proposal to weaken the critical protections provided by the 2015 coal ash rule. Below I outline how your proposal will leave communities and our environment vulnerable to toxic coal ash contamination and catastrophic spills.<br/><br/>GUTTING OF GROUNDWATER PROTECTION STANDARDS: I oppose your proposal to weaken the groundwater protection standards. Thousands of massive, aging coal ash pits are leaking heavy metals and toxic pollutants into groundwater. Coal ash dumping has led to water contamination and disastrous coal ash spills. Your proposal to allow states and polluters to use &quot;alternative&quot; groundwater protection standards for determining when cleanup is required will only enable states and polluters to hide the truth about contamination.<br/><br/>GUTTING OF GROUNDWATER MONITORING REQUIREMENTS: The public deserves to know if coal ash dumps in their communities are contaminating groundwater.  The groundwater monitoring requirements are vitally important to the more than 15 million households in the U.S. that rely on private wells for drinking water. It&#39;s unconscionable to allow polluters to decide when groundwater monitoring should stop.  <br/><br/>GUTTING OF CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS: Empowering polluters to avoid cleanup will result in ongoing water contamination. Allowing states or the owners of leaking dumps to determine whether cleanup or closure is necessary is dangerous. Coal ash is toxic, and weakening current standards to match those of town dumps endangers all communities that are near coal ash ponds and landfills. And just because a coal ash dump is no longer receiving waste doesn&#39;t mean that it no longer poses a threat to health and the environment. I oppose your proposal to treat coal ash like household garbage and to reduce the 30-year post-closure monitoring period for dumps that are no longer receiving waste.  <br/><br/>GUTTING OF LOCATION RESTRICTIONS: Prohibitions on dumping coal ash in groundwater, wetlands, floodplains, fault zones, seismic zones and unstable areas are commonsense requirements that prevent water contamination. I oppose your proposal to give states and polluters the discretion to ignore crucial and life-saving location prohibitions (and to do so without public notification or oversight), and reject any extension of the October 2018 deadline to comply with these requirements. <br/><br/>GUTTING CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR LEAKING UNLINED DUMPS: I strongly oppose your proposal to give states and polluters the discretion not to close or retrofit dangerous leaking unlined pits. If these leaking dumps are allowed to operate, they will keep polluting our drinking water and waterways and continue to threaten catastrophic spills. <br/><br/>THE EPAS CURRENT RULEMAKING PROCESS IS FLAWED AND LIMITS PUBLIC INPUT: The EPA has failed to consider widespread evidence of overwhelming groundwater contamination before proposing to weaken the coal ash rule. Industry data shows arsenic in groundwater near ash dumps exceeds federal drinking water standards at most plants. Dangerous levels of lead, thallium, selenium or radium are also very common.  Moreover, 45 days is far too short a time for the public to provide meaningful comment. By failing to hold any field hearings in impacted communities, the EPA is silencing the voices of those directly harmed. <br/><br/>I urge you to protect us from coal ash and preserve all of the minimum protections provided by the 2015 coal ash rule.<br/><br/>Lastly, it is sad for this country and it&#39;s only significant environmental protection agency with any effect still allow coal to be used a power source in this age of scientific enlightenment of viable energy alternatives. The very existence of these draconian protrusions in the energy manufacturing pantheon not only allows these plants to perpetuate but gives the power wealthy families of these utterly backwards energy choices the latitude to make laws that overtly and covertly kill any possibility of proven energy alternatives to take root. The cleaner coal argument is false in its foundation- a continuation of coal magnates from decades ago entrenched in the American political scheme. Magnates that hold influence over the very best of protection agencys established and for reasons they don&#39;t even think about on any given day.<br/><br/>Please consider our plea.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Justin Peek <br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Justin Peek",

This comes at the expense of bluefin tuna, marlin, and the recreational fishing industry, which generates hundreds of thousands of jobs and contributes billions to the economy. Many of the options put forth in the Scoping Document do not further fish conservation or stock recovery. <br/><br/>I ask the National Marine Fisheries Service to, instead of bolstering the fishery responsible for closures and gear restrictions, take action to bolster bluefin tuna and marlin fish stocks. At a minimum, the &quot;no action&quot; option should be taken to maintain current closures and restricted areas. Please consider management options that achieve greater conservation benefits for Atlantic bluefin tuna and marlin.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Brett Wolf<br/>Owner of True Blue Bonefish",

Less clean than Gas or hydroelectric plants energy and bad for environment, bad for wildlife, bad for Humans. Uses more earth minerals than any other energy. Only works 17 to 35% of time. <br/><br/>NOT SAFE, The wind turbine requires an astounding amount of toxic rare earth minerals, primarily neodymium and dysprosium, which are key components of the magnets used in modern wind turbines. most common uses is in the generators . Environmental damages, consider that mining one ton of rare earth minerals produces about one ton of radioactive waste, according to the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security. 13,131 MW of wind generating capacity means that between 4.9 million pounds (using MITs estimate) and 6.1 million pounds (using the Bulletin of Atomic Sciences estimate) of rare earths were used in wind turbines installed in 2012. 2 megawatt (MW) wind turbine contains about 800 pounds of toxic rare earths called neodymium and 130 pounds of dysprosium. mined by children in Africa and Chile.. <br/><br/>NOT SAFE, Between 4.9 million and 6.1 million pounds of radioactive waste were created to make these wind turbines. That means the U.S. wind industry may create more radioactive waste in year than our entire nuclear industry produced in spent fuel. few are paying attention to the wind industrys less efficient and less transparent use of radioactive material via rare earth mineral excavation in China. <br/><br/>NOT SAFE, Not only do rare earths create radioactive waste residue, but according to the Chinese Society for Rare Earths, one ton of calcined rare earth ore generates 9,600 to 12,000 cubic meters (339,021 to 423,776 cubic feet) of waste gas containing dust concentrate, hydrofluoric acid, sulfur dioxide, and sulfuric acid, [and] approximately 75 cubic meters (2,649 cubic feet) of acidic wastewater. . <br/><br/>The wind industry is dependent on rare earth minerals imported from China, the procurement of which results in staggering environmental damages. not one step of the rare earth mining process that is not disastrous for the environment. That the destruction is mostly unseen and far-flung does not make it any less damaging. Wind energy poses serious environmental risks availability of REEs appears to be at risk based on a number of factors. Of particular significance, one country (China) controls 98% of current supply (production). Historically, much lower levels of market concentration have harmed manufacturing firms. in 1978 Zaire controlled 48% of the cobalt supply and yet political unrest in Zaire resulted in a disruption to global supply that became known as the Cobalt Crisis REEs have come under global scrutiny due to environmental and social conditions under which they are mined, further increasing their supply risk.<br/><br/>Each Turbine needs 45 tons of steel rebar and 630 cubic yards of concrete, cast iron, turbine contains more than 8,000 different components , 116-ft blades atop a 212-ft tower for a total height of 328 feet. The blades sweep a vertical airspace of just under an acre. Vestas V90 from Denmark has 148-ft blades (sweeping more than 1.5 acres) on a 262-ft tower, totaling 410 feet. The tallest wind turbines in the U.S. have been installed in Texas  the Vestas V90 turbines are 345 feet high, Gamesa G87 from Spain, with 143-ft blades (just under 1.5 acres) on a 256-ft tower, totaling 399 feet. steel tower is anchored in a platform of more than a thousand tons of concrete and steel rebar, 30 to 50 feet across and anywhere from 6 to 30 feet deep. Shafts are sometimes driven down farther to help anchor it. Mountain tops must be blasted to create a level area of at least 3 acres. model, the nacelle alone weighs more than 56 tons, the blade assembly weighs more than 36 tons, and the tower itself weighs about 71 tons  a total weight of 164 tons. The corresponding weights for the Vestas V90 are 75, 40, and 152, total 267 tons; and for the Gamesa G87 72, 42, and 220, total 334 tons. <br/>Health Hazards of Noise and vibrations are generated by these huge monster machines and topped with flashing lights. <br/><br/>Wind turbines are not safe, high-voltage electrical devices with large moving parts, estimated that for every 100 turbines, one blade will break off (see Larwood, 2005). In winter, heavy sheets of ice can build up and then fall or be thrown off. Access to the land around wind turbines is usually restricted, even to the landowner. <br/>Wind require heavy government subsidies to be competitive with normal electricity generators so a Dutch word for Greenie power seems graphic : &quot;subsidieslurpers&quot; (subsidy gobblers). <br/><br/> the 5,700 turbines installed in the United States in 2009 required approximately 36,000 miles of steel rebar and 1.7 million cubic yards of concrete (enough to pave a four-foot-wide, 7,630-mile-long sidewalk).",

That the destruction is mostly unseen and far-flung does not make it any less damaging. Wind energy poses serious environmental risks availability of REEs appears to be at risk based on a number of factors. in 1978 Zaire controlled 48% of the cobalt supply and yet political unrest in Zaire resulted in a disruption to global supply that became known as the Cobalt Crisis REEs have come under global scrutiny due to environmental and social conditions under which they are mined, further increasing their supply risk.<br/><br/>NOT SAFE, Wind turbine requires an astounding amount of toxic rare earth minerals, primarily neodymium and dysprosium, which are key components of the magnets used in modern wind turbines. most common uses is in the generators . Environmental damages, consider that mining one ton of rare earth minerals produces about one ton of radioactive waste, according to the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security. 13,131 MW of wind generating capacity means that between 4.9 million pounds (using MITs estimate) and 6.1 million pounds (using the Bulletin of Atomic Sciences estimate) of rare earths were used in wind turbines installed in 2012. 2 megawatt (MW) wind turbine contains about 800 pounds of toxic rare earths called neodymium and 130 pounds of dysprosium. mined by children in Africa and Chile.. <br/><br/>NOT SAFE, Between 4.9 million and 6.1 million pounds of radioactive waste were created to make these wind turbines. That means the U.S. wind industry may create more radioactive waste in year than our entire nuclear industry produced in spent fuel. few are paying attention to the wind industrys less efficient and less transparent use of radioactive material via rare earth mineral excavation in China. <br/><br/>NOT SAFE, Not only do rare earths create radioactive waste residue, but according to the Chinese Society for Rare Earths, one ton of calcined rare earth ore generates 9,600 to 12,000 cubic meters (339,021 to 423,776 cubic feet) of waste gas containing dust concentrate, hydrofluoric acid, sulfur dioxide, and sulfuric acid, [and] approximately 75 cubic meters (2,649 cubic feet) of acidic wastewater. .<br/><br/>Each Turbine needs 45 tons of steel rebar and 630 cubic yards of concrete, cast iron, turbine contains more than 8,000 different components , 116-ft blades atop a 212-ft tower for a total height of 328 feet. The blades sweep a vertical airspace of just under an acre. Vestas V90 from Denmark has 148-ft blades (sweeping more than 1.5 acres) on a 262-ft tower, totaling 410 feet. The tallest wind turbines in the U.S. have been installed in Texas  the Vestas V90 turbines are 345 feet high, Gamesa G87 from Spain, with 143-ft blades (just under 1.5 acres) on a 256-ft tower, totaling 399 feet. steel tower is anchored in a platform of more than a thousand tons of concrete and steel rebar, 30 to 50 feet across and anywhere from 6 to 30 feet deep. Shafts are sometimes driven down farther to help anchor it. Mountain tops must be blasted to create a level area of at least 3 acres. model, the nacelle alone weighs more than 56 tons, the blade assembly weighs more than 36 tons, and the tower itself weighs about 71 tons  a total weight of 164 tons. The corresponding weights for the Vestas V90 are 75, 40, and 152, total 267 tons; and for the Gamesa G87 72, 42, and 220, total 334 tons. <br/>Health Hazards of Noise and vibrations are generated by these huge monster machines and topped with flashing lights. Wind turbines are not safe, high-voltage electrical devices with large moving parts, estimated that for every 100 turbines, one blade will break off (see Larwood, 2005). In winter, heavy sheets of ice can build up and then fall or be thrown off. Access to the land around wind turbines is usually restricted, even to the landowner. <br/><br/> The 5,700 turbines installed in the United States in 2009 required approximately 36,000 miles of steel rebar and 1.7 million cubic yards of concrete (enough to pave a four-foot-wide, 7,630-mile-long sidewalk).<br/><br/>Wind require heavy government subsidies to be competitive with normal electricity generators so a Dutch word for Greenie power seems graphic : &quot;subsidieslurpers&quot; (subsidy gobblers).<br/>",

    "text": " <br/>As a concerned citizen of Alabama, I respectfully submit the following comments to express my opposition to the proposed rule.<br/><br/>Due to (1) the major threat coal ash poses to public health, (2) the history of unlined and leaking storage ponds in Alabama, and (3) the positive provisions of the 2015 coal ash rule, I oppose the loopholes and flexibilities within this proposed rule. The proposal seeks to roll back the 2015 rule in favor of a scheme that allows power plants to set their own standards and escape accountability. These provisions will harm communities in Alabama and across the country.<br/><br/>Alabama is fraught with cautionary tales about the dangers of coal ash. For decades, the states nine active and inactive power plants have burned coal.  As a result, more than 100 million cubic yards of coal ash exists in Alabama. There are around two dozen coal ash pits; nearly every one is an unlined pond leaking directly into an important river or stream. Coal ash contains carcinogens, toxins, and heavy metals -- all of which have repeatedly contaminated groundwater, private wells, and rivers used for drinking water. The 2018 groundwater monitoring reports showed dangerous contamination surrounding all six coal ash facilities in the state. Additionally, Uniontown, Alabama now stores ash from the 2008 Kingston spill; the town claims serious degradation of health and quality of life thanks to improper storage.<br/><br/>DISCRETIONARY REMEDIATION AND MONITORING: The proposed rule would allow facilities to avoid remediation when contaminated waters are not hydrologically connected to drinking waters, or are polluted by other sources. This scheme allows pollution to go unpunished and fails to protect wildlife and riverine health. Facilities may also evade regular monitoring under certain findings. Knowing how severe contamination is in Alabama, these provisions impose too much unnecessary risk for communities near storage ponds.<br/><br/>WEAKER WATER QUALITY STANDARDS: The current rule requires closure and cleanup when pollutants exceed EPAs water quality standards. The proposal would allow states to work with polluters to set less protective standards. This rollback puts Alabamians at risk by subjecting them to waters in exceedance of what is scientifically and legally safe.<br/><br/>CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS: The proposed rule would allow unlined, leaking ponds to remain open. States and polluters would get to determine whether closure is necessary. Political pressure and economic incentives may jeopardize public safety, causing facilities to stay open despite dangerous pollution.<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION: Certain underrepresented communities in Alabama will be disproportionately affected because of these rollbacks. Due to the complexity of coal ash storage and EPAs accelerated timeline, those communities will largely go unheard.<br/><br/>I oppose the proposed rule, as it will hurt water quality, human health, and riverine ecology. I urge the EPA to protect the environment and public health by withdrawing this proposal.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Eartha McGoldrick ",

The report details Russia&#39;s motives in interfering with U.S. energy markets and influencing domestic energy policy and its manipulation of Americans via social media propaganda. <br/>Russian Attempts to Influence U.S. Domestic Energy Markets by Exploiting Social Media March 1, 2018 . it demonstrates how the Kremlin manipulated various groups in an attempt to carry out its geopolitical agenda, particularly with respect to domestic energy policy. Congress committee began investigating Russian attempts to influence U.S. energy markets in the summer of 2017 intricate money-laundering scheme. Russian-sponsored agents funneled money to U.S. environmental organizations in an attempt to portray energy companies in a negative way and disrupt domestic energy markets. American social media companies produced for the Committee confirmed that Russian agents were exploiting American social media platforms in an effort to disrupt domestic energy markets, suppress research and development of fossil-fuels, and stymie efforts to expand the use of natural gas. Between 2015 and 2017, there were an estimated 9,097 Russian posts or tweets regarding U.S. energy policy or a current energy event, a significant portion of content related to energy or environmental issues. Russia exploited American social media as part of its concerted effort to disrupt U.S. energy markets and influence domestic energy policy. They targeted pipelines, fossil fuels, climate change, and other divisive issues to influence public policy in the U.S.<br/>Russia provides roughly 75 percent of the natural gas imported by countries in Central and Eastern Europe while the countries in Southeast Europe &quot;receive almost all of their natural gas from Russia.&quot; &quot;Russia&#39;s Gazprom has acknowledged for the first time a threat to its dominant position in European gas market from an expected influx of liquefied natural gas (LNG) produced in the United States under [the Trump] administration.<br/>Russia has a significant interest in disrupting U.S. energy markets and influencing domestic energy policy. American energy is booming. Surge of American energy into the global marketplace heightens the Kremlin&#39;s desire to eliminate or mitigate the American energy threat and to do so by influencing social media users, American voters, and public officials. American Gas and Oil represents a direct threat to Russian energy interests. First, an abundance of American supply in the global energy marketplace stands to reduce Russian market share and thus revenues generated from oil and gas activities. Second, by providing supply alternatives for European countries dependent on Russian supply and infrastructure, American energy stands to disrupt the Kremlin&#39;s ability to leverage energy consumption for geopolitical influence. <br/>The United States has recently experienced an energy production boom that stands to &quot;fundamentally reshape the global energy landscape. primarily &quot;attributable to increased production of natural gas and crude oil enabled by the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques,&quot; also referred to as fracking<br/>European officials, and the U.S. intelligence community have all publicly noted that Russia and its government corporations are funding a covert anti-fracking campaign to suppress the widespread adoption of fracking in Europe and the U.S., all in an effort to protect the influence of the Russian oil and gas sector.<br/>Secretary General of NATO, told reporters in 2014, &quot;Russia, as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations, engaged actively with so-called nongovernmental organizationsenvironmental organizations working against shale gasto maintain dependence on imported Russian gas.<br/>On July 7, 2017, Chairman of Energy Subcommittee Chairman sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin requesting that the Treasury Department investigate allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. energy market through covertly funding radical environmental groups opposed to fossil fuels.",

    "text": "The Clean Power Plan should be repealed by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) because a number of scientists and environmental leaders around the world are communicating that in fact climate science is not settled as some leaders have promoted for political reasons.  In addition, a leading environment activist has reported that anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are beneficial to life on earth rather than endangering life on earth.<br/><br/>For example, Patrick Moore, the co-founder of Greenpeace, released a paper in June 2016 entitled, &quot;The Positive Impact of Human CO2 Emissions on the Survival of Life on Earth.&quot;  A key point by Moore is that the earth&#39;s atmospheric CO2 levels were trending below 180 parts per million (ppm) such that the earth&#39;s atmosphere would lack sufficient CO2 to sustain plant life.  An electronic file of Moore&#39;s report is included with these comments.<br/><br/>Moore provided three critical findings: (1) &quot;Human emissions of CO2 have restored a balance to the global carbon cycle, thereby ensuring the long-term continuation of life on Earth.&quot;, (2) &quot;The extremely positive aspect of human CO2 emissions must be weighed against the unproven hypothesis that human CO2 emissions will cause a catastrophic warming of the climate in coming years.&quot;, and (3) &quot;The one-sided political treatment of CO2 as a pollutant that should be radically reduced must be corrected in light of the indisputable scientific evidence that it is essential to life on Earth.&quot;<br/><br/>As a life-long environmental activist and leader, Moore&#39;s findings are profound in that they are counter to the prevailing political wisdom concerning the effects of anthropogenic CO2 emissions as presenting great negative consequences and endangering life on Earth.  The ramifications identified by Moore are that our world would begin to face food shortages and would become increasingly challenged to feed the world&#39;s growing population.  This is especially noteworthy as countries around the world strive to transition large population groups from extreme poverty to middle class quality of life and education.  Moore identifies anthropogenic CO2 as a providing a positive impact in forestalling/preventing a food crisis on earth and allowing people to be lifted out of poverty.<br/><br/>In addition, reports issued by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found, &quot;The current rate of global mean sea level change, starting in the late 19th - early 20th century, is, with medium confidence, unusually high in the context of centennial-scale variations of the last two millennia.&quot;  The IPCC&#39;s definition of &quot;medium confidence&quot; rates findings at a 50% chance of being correct, which also means that this finding is rated at a 50% chance of being wrong.  Surely a 50-50 chance of being right or wrong is not settled science.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the IPCC report provides &quot;very high confidence&quot; findings that actual historical precedent for glacial cycles prior to anthropogenic CO2 emissions have resulted in at least 5 meter sea level rise higher than at present and that rising sea level is to be expected following the Little Ice Age.   Therefore, it would be intellectually incorrect to assign recent rise in sea level rise solely to anthropogenic CO2 emissions since the Little Ice Age ended circa 1750.  <br/><br/>These facts from the IPCC report are important because they identify non-anthropogenic CO2 emission factors predominately responsible for rising sea level that are not being addressed in solution discussions given the incorrect political focus on anthropogenic CO2 emissions as the root cause.  Clarifying the correct root cause(s) is extremely important to ensure that efforts to prevent the estimated damage due to rising sea levels are properly focused on solutions that actually address the true root cause(s).  Failure to do so will allow the estimated damage to occur.  <br/><br/>So, it is vitally important that U.S. and international policies concerning responses to rising sea level properly understand the controlling factors and the beneficial contributions of higher than 180ppm atmospheric CO2 levels to global food production so as to effectively refocus solution efforts more appropriately.  Key steps toward appropriately addressing rising sea levels is to repeal the Clean Power Plan, repeal the EPA&#39;s endangerment finding on CO2,  and to focus efforts and resources on solutions to address rising sea level damage.",

Pre-market review would be cost prohibitive for many manufacturers, effectively eliminating their ability to release special editions and seasonal blends. Such products are a distinctive aspect of the industry and a large part of what consumers like myself are looking for and enjoy.<br/><br/>I oppose a ban on sampling. Product sampling is an integral part of the unique experience at a premium cigar shop. A sampling ban would prohibit consumers like myself from being able to try new products in my shop and at cigar charity events, which drive consumer purchasing. Given the typical price point and celebratory nature of premium cigars, customers are less likely to purchase an unfamiliar product.<br/><br/>I oppose an arbitrary price point for a cigar to be deemed &quot;premium. Premium cigars, those that are, but not limited to, defined as being hand rolled, quality, humidity controlled, cigars, are not what underage children go for. They are not addictive like cigarettes, they are not consumed with anywhere near the regularity of cigarettes, and to confuse their use with cigarette use is problematic. <br/><br/>For thes reasons, it is critical that the FDA consider the difference between premium cigars and other tobacco products when drafting the final regulations. Premium cigars are an adult product, without the habitual use patterns of mass-market tobacco products. Existing state law prohibits the sale of products to minors. <br/><br/>I urge you to exempt premium cigars from the final FDA regulations. Imposing one-size-fits-all regulations on a diverse suite of tobacco products is a step in the wrong direction for the FDA.

References state that woody or other undesirable plants adversely affect the integrity of containment structures and increase the risks of failures and spills.<br/><br/>Neither the proposed rule, or the references cited address structures that enclose non-flowable materials nor do they consider the minimal risk that these structures represent.<br/><br/>Power generators are exploring or implementing methods for CCR compliance. One of these methods is solidification and stabilization of CCRs using the self-cementing capacity of fly ash, or additives such as Portland cement or lime.<br/><br/>Some practices include the removal of CCRs from an impoundment followed by solidification and placement back into the impoundment, or solidification  in place.  Regardless of the method used, the result is a solid product that is not susceptible to liquification and does not impose hydraulic pressure on containment structures. These facilities contain little to no accumulated water.  Precipitation that falls on these structures is managed as runoff and promptly removed.  Thus, no appreciable quantity of water is ever contained within impoundments that contain solidified CCRs.<br/><br/>It known that trees and deep root structures contribute to slope stability and inhibit erosion (Ref: I,ii,iii). These references document reduced slope stability caused by removal of trees from activities that involve tree removal.  They clearly show that trees and their roots enhance slope stability and that their removal results in erosion, slope instability and landslides.<br/><br/>A solidified CCR disposal facility is referenced where trees are intentionally used to enhance slope stability. Thjis is the Matra Plant near Budapest, Hungary.  It contains 25 million cu. yds of solidified CCRs in a tiered impoundment that covers 314 acres at its base and 200 acres on top and is 150 ft. high.  It has been in operation for 20 years and the slopes are planted with trees.  The facility reached its permitted height and was closed in 2015.  Then, the top was developed to support a solar collection facility that generates 18.5 MW.  The solar collection facility alone demonstrates the stability of the entire structure.<br/>This facility has not experienced any slope failures or slope stability issues during its operation.<br/><br/>Photo of Matra Facility included in attached file<br/><br/>The purpose of this comment is to encourage EPA to recognize that:<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Woody plants and trees enhance the stability and erosional resistance of sloped structures that are not subject to hydraulic pressure.<br/><br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>CCRs that have been mixed with solidification agents are placed into impoundments in lifts that are only a few inches deep before solidifying. This is not deep enough to impart hydraulic pressure of any consequence.<br/><br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Rain that falls on impoundments containing solidified CCRs is managed as runoff and is promptly removed thus preventing accumulations of more than a few inches.<br/><br/>We respectfully request that the revised rule be modified to allow the presence of woody plants and trees on the slopes of structures that surround solidified CCRs.<br/><br/>The commenter, Dale Timmons is a Registered Geologist and Hydrogeologist in Oregon and Washington.  Mr. Timmons has extensive experience in rock/soil mechanics, slope stability.  In addition, he has extensive experience with ash/wastewater management, particularly in the field of solidification and stabilization of ash and wastewater originating from coal fired power plants.<br/><br/>References:<br/>  Ziemer, R.R., The role of Vegetation in the Stability of Forested Slopes, Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,<br/><br/>  Slope Stability Reference Guide for National Forests in the United States, Volume I, U.S. Department of Agriculture, EM-7170-13, 1994<br/><br/>  Reid, L.M., Implications of the USGS Analysis of Slope Stability at Sulphur Creek, USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station Redwood Sciences Laboratory.<br/>",

    "docAbstract": "The EPA is publishing a proposed rule addressing specific technical issues on which the Agency agreed to a remand as a result of litigation of the final Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Disposal Rule, published April 17, 2015. Issues covered by this proposal will include, but are not limited to, the height limitation of the vegetative slopes of dikes; the type and magnitude of non-groundwater releases that would require a facility to comply with some or all of the corrective action procedures set forth in the final CCR rule; and adding boron to the list of contaminants in Appendix IV of the final CCR rule that trigger the corrective action requirements under the final rule."

    "docAbstract": "The EPA is taking action to repeal the Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units (EGUs), commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan, as promulgated October 23, 2015. The EPA is also proposing the Affordable Clean Energy rule which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE rule would replace the 2015 Clean Power Plan, which EPA has proposed to repeal because it exceeded EPA's authority."

Low carbohydrate diets have been shown to be effective at losing weight and correcting dyslipidemia, such as high LDL cholesterol and elevated triglycerides. <br/><br/>The standard high-carbohydrate American diet has lead to the majority of Americans to be in a chronic state of hyperglycemia. This has lead to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, even in children, and an epidemic of metabolic syndrome that has shown no sign of abating.<br/><br/>Another American epidemic that is associated with high-carbohydrate diets is Alzheimer&#39;s disease, which is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States and will cost the nation $277 billion in 2018. This could be significantly reduced by recommending low-carbohydrate diets for those with chronic hyperglycemia. <br/><br/>I have attached an annotated guide that I&#39;ve put together which indicates how high levels of carbohydrates cause various forms of metabolic syndrome and mental dysfunction. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to consider this consequential matter.",
