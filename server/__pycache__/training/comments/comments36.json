Unfortunately, our culture has become less graceful, more crass, more narcissistic, with telephone etiquette a casualty of our increasingly selfish behavior. Why give the boors of the world yet another venue in which to practice their objectionable ways?

Lambda cyhalothrin is a critically important pest management tool for U.S. alfalfa farmers. <br/><br/>Several pyrethroid insecticides are registered for use on alfalfa. These include beta-cyfluthrin, gamma-cyfluthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, permethrin, and zeta-cypermethrin. In forage alfalfa these insecticides provide cost effective control of defoliating insects including a wide range of caterpillar pests and several species of weevils. For aphid control on forage alfalfa lambda-cyhalothrin is the pyrthroid that is applied most frequently.<br/><br/>In alfalfa produced for seed, pyrethroids are applied pre- and post-bloom where they provide control of the pests detailed above. However, Lygus bugs are the key direct economic pest in alfalfa produced for seed for which pyrethroids are applied. Bifenthrin is registered in many western states under 24C Special Local Need and is the pyrethroid applied the most for Lygus bug control pre-bloom. Post-bloom bifenthrin, as well as lambda-cyhalothrin, are the two pyrethroids of choice among farmers. <br/><br/>The alfalfa seed industry has supported two IPM specialists in the Pacific Northwest, Dr. Doug Walsh, Washington State University, and Dr. Jim Barbour, University of Idaho. Collectively, they have recently completed a project supported by the USDA-NIFA Alfalfa Seed and Forage Systems Research Program (AFRP) on Lygus bug management in alfalfa produced for seed. Collectively, Walsh and Barbour have proved that alfalfa seed farmers are following IPM recommendations and Lygus bug populations in alfalfa seed fields are not resistant to pyrethroids. Most notably this is true for bifenthrin.<br/><br/>At present, the only viable alternatives to pyrethroids for pre- and post-bloom control of Lygus bugs on alfalfa produced for seed are dimethoate, chlorpyrifos, and sulfoxaflor. In the past endosulfan and carbofuran were insecticides that were effective on Lygus pre- and post-bloom, but regulatory actions eliminated the use of these insecticides for Lygus bug control.<br/><br/>For these reasons NAFA strongly supports the continued access to lambda cyhalothrin by alfalfa forage and alfalfa seed farmers.<br/><br/>If you should have any questions about the information listed above, please don&#39;t hesitate in contacting me. <br/>Thank you for your consideration. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/> <br/>Beth Nelson<br/>President <br/>",

    "text": "I strongly agree with my consultation psychiatry colleagues: I object to the proposal to eliminate consultation codes effective 1/1/2010.  A psychiatric subspecialty (in which my colleagues and myself have specialty qualifications) has been developed to recognize the additional knowledge and skill base required to complete the services that are requisite to performing  in-patient psychiatry consultations.  Consultations are typically requested in complex and difficult cases that necessarily require a comprehensive review of medical records, an in-depth history and examination, along with the collection of collateral information  The consultant prepares a detailed report outlining the findings of the consultation and not infrequently discusses the case in detail with various other medical providers. A separate code with appropriately increased reimbursement rates are needed for this specialized service.  The proposed change to reimbursement as an initial evaluation does not capture nor reflect the added breadth and intensity of services performed in the psychiatric in-patient consultation.  <br/><br/>I agree with the statement that the difficulty in correctly coding consultations has to do with the vague and ill-defined standards as they apply to specialty specific consultations and the fact that there are five different levels of consultation codes. A more reasonable approach to deal with the difficulty in correctly coding for consultations would be to reduce the number of consultation levels to three and to improve the clarity and applicability of the guidelines to actual clinical practice.",

    "text": "I applaud the EEOC&#39;s Proposed Enforcement Guidance on Unlawful Harassment.  I am encouraged to see the scenarios provided as these offer better definition regarding what is and is not considered harassment.  <br/><br/>Additionally, I am very encouraged that the EEOC is recognizing the importance of effective training programs.  Too many organizations rely on &quot;check the box&quot; harassment training, and those programs are ineffective.  As is noted in this guidance, effective training must be ongoing, engaging, and tailored to the organization&#39;s workforce and the specific issues they encounter.  <br/><br/>I am most impressed that the EEOC is encouraging employers to include a focus on civility and bystander intervention training.  I am an HR professional, and I can attest to the positive impact of workplace civility initiatives.  As noted in the report, incivility leads to harassing behavior, but civility training makes way for empathy, an assumption of good will that allows for healthy dialogue, and a common language of expectations.  Even customer service training can achieve harassment prevention results if it focuses on civility and internal as well as external customer service scenarios.  <br/><br/>I understand the concerns that one respondent noted about how to define civil behavior.  While it has been my experience that if you conduct a dialogue with employees about what is and isn&#39;t acceptable behavior, they generally recognize and acknowledge appropriate behaviors; however, current societal trends toward incivility are resulting in confusion for employees and employers alike.  In an era where our political leaders have displayed a shocking lack of civility with no consequences and the NLRB has protected remarks that are discriminatory and dehumanizing in tone, defining civility has become a tremendous challenge, further emphasizing the need to offer workplace training that focuses on empathy and respectful dialogue.<br/><br/>Effective training programs can produce a large return on investment when harassment diminishes, resulting in smaller caseloads for the EEOC, reduced legal expenses for employers, and a healthier workforce overall (which is the ultimate goal).  Unfortunately, I believe most business leaders lack the skills and resources to provide the type of training necessary to ensure that harassing behaviors are eliminated.  Therefore, my recommendation to the EEOC is that the agency offer as much outreach and training support to employers as possible.<br/>",

    "text": "I&#39;m disturbed at the betrayal of a basic American ideal: Innocent until proven guilty.<br/><br/>First off, why should the *respondent* be the one who has to, say, change shifts or even sit at home while an investigation is still going on? By definition, we don&#39;t yet know that s/he&#39;s guilty. If respondent and complainant have to be separated during the investigation, why not do it more equitably -- say, have the respondent only work certain days while the complainant only works others. Or if the complainant can telework but not the respondent, let the complainant telework (or of course vice versa).<br/><br/>Secondly, an inconclusive finding still means the respondent wasn&#39;t proven guilty. So why should s/he necessarily get more scrutiny -- or even a harsher penalty if found guilty of something else in the future?<br/><br/>Finally, this proposed policy puts much more emphasis on catching and punishing harassers than on weeding out false (or otherwise wrongful) harassment complaints...let alone punishing false accusers. It barely gives lip service to investigations themselves...I guess it&#39;s still a but beyond the pale to (openly admit that you) just punish upon accusation. But obviously, the behemoth is all-out for convicting alleged harassers, not so much for avoiding punishing the innocent.<br/><br/>Employers can&#39;t possibly miss the pervasive message: Always err on the side of finding the accused guilty -- and preferably firing them. No surprise that business (and college) decision-makers have told me things like: &quot;If she says it&#39;s harassment, it&#39;s harassment,&quot; and &quot;Harassment is anything the other person perceives as harassing.&quot; <br/><br/>Private businesses might make unfair judgments. But we need our own government to not *force* them to violate due process. And just like when businesses put our health at risk they have to arrange to clean up the hazards, when our own government puts rights like due process at risk it needs to keep those risks at bay.<br/><br/>The EEOC can start by including some basic due process principles and guidelines, and some examples of employers either vindicating the rights of the innocent...or railroading innocent people *and* suffering consequences. For example, the EEOC can remind employers of the dangers of becoming &quot;cat&#39;s paws&quot;: See Staub v. Proctor Hospital, 562 U.S. 411 (2011).<br/><br/>Bottom line: The whole anti-harassment enforcement mechanism needs a *dual* emphasis: Stopping and punishing harassment *and* making sure that it&#39;s only actual harassers -- not folks who just annoyed the wrong person or tripped somebody&#39;s hair trigger sensibilities -- who get punished.<br/>",

    "text": "I am strongly against the use of cell phones on airplanes.  First, it is excessively disruptive if you happen to be seated next to someone who decides to talk over the phone on an entire trip.  Why should I be subjected to that?  Even though it&#39;s true that people can converse on a plane, the amount of conversation is usually minimal.  Many of us rely on plane travel for business and if I have work to do, I can&#39;t possibly think through strategic elements while listening to someone vent about their boss at Burger King or listening to the details of their latest drunk night partying (discretion anyone?).  It is disrupting enough when I have to be involved while on public transportation which is usually a much shorter time. People seem to lose the ability to edit their conversations for a general audience when talking on a cell phone in a public place.  I purposely don&#39;t answer my phone if I am in a situation where a conversation would be disruptive.<br/>Second, is there nowhere to have any peace and quiet anymore?  Studies have shown that constant distractions, noise, and disruption lead to frustration which leads to anger.  We already have enough incidences of &quot;air rage&quot; and the staff working on a plane should not have to act as referees to people bickering about the noise involved in phone conversations.  Just stick to texting!  We have managed to survive a plane ride for years without being on a phone at the same time.  I remember being able to READ and WORK in an airport before they installed TVs everywhere.  How much assisted distraction do we need?  Learn to read and bring a book or magazine.  <br/>Third, why should anyone have to pay extra to be seated in an area of the plane where the noise level is minimal if the airlines were to allocate special sections?  It&#39;s as stupid as smoking on a plane - the smoke affects everyone.  And not all travelers have the resources to spend extra for quiet which should be a basic right - to travel in some comfort (although with the recent seat configurations that is almost over).  And people should not have to purchase expensive noise-cancelling headphones just to have quiet.  Honestly - I have never been able to find any that fit well and they are uncomfortable to wear for any amount of time.  Ear-buds don&#39;t effectively block noise and ear plugs may not as well.<br/>Fourth, safety.  In an emergence, will people be so distracted by their phone calls that they miss important emergency instructions?  I don&#39;t want my exit from a plane blocked by someone fussing with their phone.  Enough said.<br/>It is important to think about overall considerations in a large society.  As we spend more and more time on planes, we should have some basic rights - safety and comfort being most important.  Allowing phones seems like a recipe for disaster by compromising the safety of every passenger and the airplane staff in the case of an emergency or the &quot;air rage&quot; that rude passengers might incite.  And there is comfort - do we really need to be on the phone 24/7 and disrupting everyone around us? Some people actually see a plane ride as an escape and a way to read, relax or sleep.<br/>",

    "text": "When it comes to battery safety, it is a serious concern for the users of electronic cigarettes. The only way for a battery to explode during the use of an electronic cigarette is by causing a hard short within the battery. It can be compared to misuse of a firearm. If the user is uneducated, uninformed, or negligent they may be at risk of critical battery failure resulting in an explosion. Those who use electronic cigarettes in an informed and educated fashion will never see the event of critical battery failure. The condition of the batteries, the resistance of the load on the batteries, and the condition of the device being used all contribute toward battery safety. A few unfortunate souls who have neglected the seriousness of battery safety have blackened the eyes of all electronic cigarette users. I personally have used electronic cigarettes for five years. Battery safety is at the forefront of my usage. I have researched the facts of the volatile chemical reactions in these batteries. Most of my fellow electronic cigarette users know of the risks involved and take the proper precautions to prevent battery failure. Out of the millions of individuals who use vaping as a life saving, and prolonging measure very few unfereducated individuals have been victims of their own battery negligence. The fact is that vaping is a 95% safer alternative to combustible cigarettes. Vaping takes a large portion of profit from pharmaceutical companies that prey on the victims of combustible cigarettes. There is no doubt children should not be using electronic cigarettes. There is no doubt anything with the potential of being harmful in the wrong hands will most likely be harmful. Vaping regulated correctly for current combustible cigarette smokers can and will dramatically improve the their lives. It is a fact that the health of a converted combustible cigarette user will dramatically improve through the use of electronic cigarettes. The use of electronic cigarettes has strengthened me,prolong my life,improved my relationships, and has given me more time with the ones that I love. Let&#39;s not kill a revolutionary health benefits because it takes capital from those with an agenda other than public health.",

I fly fairly often and enjoy the time that it gives me to relax and rest, work quietly for my business, or make use of personal entertainment. An aircraft cabin is already a noisy environment. The addition of people talking on mobile devices above this din, will exacerbate the noisy situation. <br/><br/>While I do have noise cancelling headphones, if the person next to me is speaking in a loud voice, I can still hear them. Most people also tend to speak louder when on a mobile device. This is mostly due to the impression that they need to speak at high volume to overcome any other ambient sound they are hearing.  <br/><br/>I am requesting that the policy of allowing voice mobile device usage prior to the door closing at the beginning of a flight, and upon reaching the tarmac at the end of a flight is enough time for voice communications. I fear that failure to have such rules in place will lead to more &quot;air rage&quot;, which could endanger safety of the pilots, flight attendants, and other passengers.<br/><br/>Respectfully Submitted,<br/>Richard C.

    "text": "Docket No. FDA-2015-N-1765<br/><br/> <br/><br/>As an employee in the indoor tanning industry, I strongly oppose the FDAs proposal to ban tanning by minors and to require customers to sign a risk acknowledgement form every six months. Our customers enjoy tanning for a variety of reasons, and for the reasons outlined below, no further government regulation is needed.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>First, the decision of whether a minor should tan, be that outdoors in the sun or indoors at a tanning salon (that enforces limited tan times and other safety precautions), is best left to parents, not the federal government. Most states already require parental consent for minors to tan indoors, ensuring the parent has input and approval.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>In addition, we have many teenage clients who are referred to indoor tanning by their doctor or dermatologist to treat skin conditions. Why should these clients be required to obtain these services at a dermatology office which is much more expensive than at an indoor tanning salon?  <br/><br/> <br/><br/>If minors are prohibited from using indoor tanning salons, they will instead use sunbeds at home, in an unregulated and unsupervised environment, and likely tan more aggressively outdoors. These alternatives would lead to an increase in sunburn and injury, compared to tanning at our salons which enforce tan time limits and other safety precautions. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Next, requiring adults to sign a risk acknowledgement certification every six months in order to use a sunbed is absurd. Our customers are already required to acknowledge risk before their first session; requiring this to be done every six months would be an administrative nightmare and tremendous burden to our salon employees, without serving any valid public purpose. There is no other product or service in the country, including the purchase of alcohol, tobacco and red meat, that requires consumers to sign such a form. It would be unfair to require such a form in our business and not for the hundreds of products and services which present many more dangers than UV exposure.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>For all of these reasons, I am strongly opposed to these proposed additional regulations. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>",

If you could continue you allow captive breeding/selling but require &quot;proof of origin&quot; documentation then that would help to satisfy the breeders/sellers/hobbyists while mostly protecting the species from importation and wild collection.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Nick",

    "text": "While the overall guidance is very helpful to EEO practitioners, there are a number of areas of concern:<br/><br/>1. On page 45, the Commission should adopt the holding of a number of courts who agree that an employer may avoid liability by proving that the employer exercised reasonable care.  An employer has no control over how an employee responds and therefore should not have to demonstrate an employee acted unreasonably.<br/>2. On page 38, Example 20, the Commission needs to clarify that an employer cannot be held liable for anything an employee posts on social media off-duty, while using his or her own electronic device(s).  Instead, it is the subsequent discriminatory behavior during working hours that is at issue.<br/>3. On page 13, it appears the Commission is adopting the position that one act of discrimination renders all subsequent harassment as automatically discriminatory.  Instead, the Commission should clarify that the fact that an individual engaged in an act of discrimination does not mean that any other acts are discriminatory.  Each act of harassment must be evaluated to determine whether discrimination was a motivation.  <br/>4. On page 20, the Commission should adopt the position that a complaint demonstrate psychological or physical harm in order to proceed.  To do otherwise subjects employers to fraudulent claims that are indefensible.  <br/>5. On page 27 and 29, the Commission should adopt the position that &quot;unwelcomeness&quot; is a necessary element of the analysis.  The changing nature of the workplace is well documented.  The Commission admits that &quot;a complainant&#39;s subjective perception can change over time.&quot;  The Commission cannot, therefore, expect that employers be &quot;mind-readers&quot;.  Instead, the burden should remain on the complainant to demonstrate that the conduct, despite his or her participation, was in fact unwelcome.  <br/>6. On page 29, absent evidence to the contrary, the Commission should adopt the position that any delay in filing a complaint is evidence that the conduct was not, in fact, severe.  Instead, the Commission, during its investigation, should require an adequate justification for the delay.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>",

    "text": "Docket No. FDA-2015-N-1765<br/> <br/>As an employee in the indoor tanning industry, I strongly oppose the FDAs proposal to ban tanning by minors and to require customers to sign a risk acknowledgement<br/> form every six months. Our customers enjoy tanning for a variety of reasons, and for the reasons outlined below, no further government regulation is needed.<br/> <br/>First, the decision of whether a minor should tan, be that outdoors in the sun or indoors at a tanning salon (that enforces limited tan times and other<br/> safety precautions), is best left to parents, not the federal government. Most states already require parental consent for minors to tan indoors, ensuring the parent has input and approval.<br/> <br/>In addition, we have many teenage clients who are referred to indoor tanning by their doctor or dermatologist to treat skin conditions. Why should these clients be<br/> required to obtain these services at a dermatology office which is much more expensive than at an indoor tanning salon? <br/><br/> <br/>If minors are prohibited from using indoor tanning salons, they will instead use sunbeds at home, in an unregulated and unsupervised environment, and likely tan more<br/> aggressively outdoors. These alternatives would lead to an increase in sunburn and injury, compared to tanning at our salons which enforce tan time limits and other safety precautions.<br/><br/> <br/>Next, requiring adults to sign a risk acknowledgement certification every six months in order to use a sunbed is absurd. Our customers<br/> are already required to acknowledge risk before their first session; requiring this to be done every six months would be an administrative nightmare and tremendous burden to our salon employees, without serving any valid public purpose. There is no other product<br/> or service in the country, including the purchase of alcohol, tobacco and red meat, that requires consumers to sign such a form. It would be unfair to require such a form in our business and not for the hundreds of products and services which present many<br/> more dangers than UV exposure.<br/> <br/>For all of these reasons, I am strongly opposed to these proposed additional regulations.<br/><br/> <br/>",

Bifenthrin is a critically important pest management tool for U.S. alfalfa farmers. <br/><br/>Several pyrethroid insecticides are registered for use on alfalfa. These include beta-cyfluthrin, gamma-cyfluthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, permethrin, and zeta-cypermethrin. In forage alfalfa these insecticides provide cost effective control of defoliating insects including a wide range of caterpillar pests and several species of weevils. For aphid control on forage alfalfa lambda-cyhalothrin is the pyrthroid that is applied most frequently.<br/><br/>In alfalfa produced for seed, pyrethroids are applied pre- and post-bloom where they provide control of the pests detailed above. However, Lygus bugs are the key direct economic pest in alfalfa produced for seed for which pyrethroids are applied. Bifenthrin is registered in many western states under 24C Special Local Need and is the pyrethroid applied the most for Lygus bug control pre-bloom. Post-bloom bifenthrin, as well as lambda-cyhalothrin, are the two pyrethroids of choice among farmers. <br/><br/>The alfalfa seed industry has supported two IPM specialists in the Pacific Northwest, Dr. Doug Walsh, Washington State University, and Dr. Jim Barbour, University of Idaho. Collectively, they have recently completed a project supported by the USDA-NIFA Alfalfa Seed and Forage Systems Research Program (AFRP) on Lygus bug management in alfalfa produced for seed. Collectively, Walsh and Barbour have proved that alfalfa seed farmers are following IPM recommendations and Lygus bug populations in alfalfa seed fields are not resistant to pyrethroids. Most notably this is true for bifenthrin.<br/><br/>At present, the only viable alternatives to pyrethroids for pre- and post-bloom control of Lygus bugs on alfalfa produced for seed are dimethoate, chlorpyrifos, and sulfoxaflor. In the past endosulfan and carbofuran were insecticides that were effective on Lygus pre- and post-bloom, but regulatory actions eliminated the use of these insecticides for Lygus bug control.<br/><br/>For these reasons NAFA strongly supports the continued access to bifenthrin by alfalfa forage and alfalfa seed farmers.<br/><br/>If you should have any questions about the information listed above, please don&#39;t hesitate in contacting me. <br/>Thank you for your consideration. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/> <br/>Beth Nelson<br/>President <br/>",

My cardiologist, as well as Internal Medical physicians have given me no restrictions to continue to drive. There is no statistical data provided that supports the position taken by FMCSR that individuals with different defibrillators are likely to pass out while driving vehicles. In fact, the purpose of a defibrillator is to regulate the heartbeat normally. This is medically supported in information. Thus, since safety is not in question, it appears to be FMCSR appears to be advocating disability discrimination. In Violation of the Americans with disability act, ADA, FMCSR offers no evidence nor statistical data that supports the blanketed assertion defibrillators are likely to cause a driver to be unable to operate a CMV. In fact, the American College of Cardiology states the following and more at http://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2014/07/18/11/37/when-is-it-safe-to-resume-driving-after-icd-implantation) &quot;a scientific statement by AHA/NASPE (15) recommended 6 months of driving restriction for patients who receive ICDs for secondary prophylaxis. On the other hand, the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), through a consensus statement(16) now recommends 3 months of restrictions follow ICD implantation, which represents a change from their previous recommendation of 6 months. Although studies in the last decade have estimated a lower risk for driving accidents and some even recommended no restriction, (14) for now a 6 month period of driving restriction remains the most current recommendation in the U.S guidelines. Additionally, it should be noted that if a patient refuses an ICD for secondary prophylaxis, apart from warning them of the possibility of a repeat arrhythmic event, a similar period of restriction from driving would be warranted. See more at: http://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2014/07/18/11/37/when-is-it-safe-to-resume-driving-after-icd-implantation#sthash.ALY2vyRW.dpuf. A defibrillator is designed to regulate the heartbeat normally. This is medically supported in information. Before taking away a property right (licenses) FMCSR should be required to produce evidence of the reason for denial merely because a driver has taken efforts to regulate the heartbeat. Since FMCSR safety concerns statement is unsupported by medical evidence the position appears to be FMCSR advocating disability discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. ",

It is estimated that indoor tanning causes upwards of 400,000 cases of skin cancer in the U.S. each year.  In fact, using indoor tanning beds before age 35 can increase your risk of melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer - by 59% and the risk increases with each use. <br/><br/>I also support the FDA&#39;s proposed risk acknowledgement form that adults would have to sign before using tanning beds and booths.  Quite a bit of misinformation exists on indoor tanning and some people think they are safe and beneficial.  The FDA&#39;s efforts will help correct this misinformation and educate adults about the risks associated with indoor tanning. <br/><br/>Restricting teens&#39; access to indoor tanning and educating all users about the dangers of tanning devices are critical steps to preventing skin cancer.  Together with the FDA&#39;s final rule reclassifying sunlamp products and the proposed rule updating sunlamp performance standards, this proposed rule will make a significant impact in reducing the incidence of skin cancer in the U.S.  I urge the FDA to finalize this proposed rule.<br/><br/>TEENS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO USE TANNING BEDS",
