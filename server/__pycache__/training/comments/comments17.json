    "text": "&quot;For the reasons set forth below, I request that the FMCSA amend the agricultural exemptions of 49 CFR, Part 390.<br/><br/>Horse show industry participants and other equine enthusiests are not commercial truck drivers, but the ELD rules turn every pickup truck pulling a horse trailer more than 150 air-miles from the ranch into a &quot;commercial motor vehicle&quot; or &quot; motor carrier.&quot; Participants in most American Quarter Horse equine disciplines are &quot;hands-on&quot; ranchers that pack-up the family and tow their beloved animals across various show, trail and /or rodeo circuits. Some do not see home for weeks at a time. Anchoring distance thresholds to their ranch or farm is impractical. Forcing them to hire commercial animal haulers to take their animals across state lines for specialized veterinary care or exhibition is unconstitutional and just unfair. <br/><br/>Livestock shows advance the art and economy of livestock breeding. Financial and zoning constraints most often force participants to assemble at remote facilities near livestock populations. For many, the venues lie outside the distance threshold. The ELD mandate&#39;s Hours of Service (HOS) rules are likewise impractical, because performance horses and other livestock, when loaded onto trailers, are vulnerable to changes in temperature, humidity, precipitation and biohazards. They need to get to the destination to stabilize. The expensive addition of a second commercially-licensed driver is an impractical option for a shrinking industry languishing on a shoe-string budget. In the absence of a second driver, unloading the animals repeatedly into expensive overnight boarding facilities (if even available) exposes the animals to communicable stall diseases and other biohazards that decimate livestock populations. The only alternative if the facilities are full is to sleep on the road or risk a substantial fine. <br/><br/>By making the truck/trailer combinations a commercial motor vehicle, and the owner a motor carrier, the FMCSA is subjecting ranchers to the compliance expense of installing the ELD device ($650), obtaining a commercial driver&#39;s license with annual health certification by a physician ($750), paying state surcharges to re-register each of their pickups as a commercial vehicle ($800); obtaining commercial vehicle insurance at a minimum of $1 million per occurrence ($1,800) to comply with state surety rules (i.e. CA DMV-67) or the FMCSA&#39;s MCS-90 rule. <br/><br/>This is overkill, plain and simple, because ranchers do not make a living moving goods for others over the road. They will not know how to comply, nor will they be able to absorb the expenses for each truck and driver. The FMCSA will essentially destroy an already-shrinking industry for no safety improvement whatsoever.<br/><br/>Please amend 49 CFR, Part 390, to bring horse show, and all other equine participants within the agricultural exemption of 49 CFR 395.1(s). We suggest the following amendments:<br/>49 CFR 390.5 Definitions:<br/>Add the following subsection to the definition of Farm vehicle driver:<br/>&quot;(f) An owner or exhibitor of livestock at a show or other competition more than150 air miles from their farm, for prizes or other consideration, is a farmer who is a not a for-hire motor carrier.&quot; <br/>&quot;(g) The transport driver of livestock more than150 air miles from their farm or location where veterinary services are received is a farmer who is a not a for-hire motor carrier.&quot;<br/>Add the following subdivision to the definition of Covered farm vehicle-<br/>&quot;; or (3) a commercial motor vehicle operated by a farmer transporting livestock to a show, exhibition, or competition for potential prizes or other consideration; or for the purpose of obtaining veterinary services more than150 air miles from their farm.&quot;<br/><br/>We thank the FMCSA for its consideration.&quot;<br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>Cindy Faith<br/>Equine owner<br/><br/> ",

In 2011, the DOL issued new regulations that reinforced the FLSA and over 40 years of custom and practice by the DOL and state agencies, affirming that tips are always the property of the employee (29 C.F.R.  531.52).<br/><br/>If adopted, this regulation would force a vulnerable workforce further into poverty, economic instability, and vulnerability to harassment and assault. Also, it smacks of more misogyny from Trump, since two out of three tipped workers are women.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to withdraw this proposed rule.<br/><br/>Timothy Shanahan<br/>TCSHAN@AOL.COM<br/>10470 Falcon Avenue<br/>Fountain Valley, California 92708",

    "text": "I&#39;m a primary care pediatrician and researcher at The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania. <br/><br/>I submit this official comment because the public needs more accurate and unbiased information about the potential harms of the IQOS and similar heat-not-burn tobacco products before they can be approved. Advertisements claim this product releases no smoke because the tobacco leaves are heated rather than burned, with no tobacco combustion. Claims and distracting wording, however, are no substitute for science. The authors of a recent report have shown that these tobacco products release cancer-causing chemicals. <br/><br/>Because of the high public health stakes and potential for unintended consequences, sound scientific evidence should drive decision-making regarding these products. Tobacco, when used as intended, causes disease, disability, and death. It is the only consumer product regulated by the FDA to fall in this category. Rather than the typical standard of approving safe and effective products, the FDAs regulatory approach to tobacco products is based on a public health standard. This standard, specified in the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, Public Law 11131 (2009), section 906(d), applies to the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and nonusers of the tobacco product and accounts for (1) the increased or decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using such products and (2) the increased or decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start using such products. In July 2017, the FDA articulated a new harm control approach to tobacco regulation, with emphasis placed on noncombustible tobacco products because they may be less dangerous than cigarettes. Thus, it is critical that regulation of heat-not-burn tobacco products are based on a dispassionate evaluation of the evidence base, not on industry statements or purported science. <br/><br/>Accordingly, all new tobacco products should be independently evaluated on their potential to entice tobacco nonusers, especially children and adolescents, and on health-related outcomes for current tobacco users, including health harms and conventional cigarette quit rates, before approving their use and marketing them to consumers.<br/><br/>The comments above are detailed further in a commentary piece published in a peer-reviewed journal, Pediatrics (See attached). <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Brian Jenssen, MD, MSHP ",

    "text": "Wildfires are the toxic carbon polluters of emissions in air and water, Not oil or gas or Not agriculture, Not Mining, or Not farms, or Not industry, or Not cars. Humans and wildlife need the Local, State, Federal leaders to re think wildfire issues, Fight wildfires before they start; California Environmental activist must allow forest workers to reduce the fuel by cutting old growth and thin the brushes and dead trees. Many forests have had fires of unprecedented intensity and extent, and this situation is the result of forest management practices that have permitted decades of deadwood (fuels) to accumulate. Forests are over grown with dead trees in tinder-dry conditions more susceptible to intense fires. Must shifting fire policies from suppression to recognition that reducing fire fuel is an integral component of the landscape. Wildfire needs to be part of any Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) 2012 act which only cover 28 states but not California, Why ? since the act was to address air pollution from states that send pollution across state lines and affects air quality in other states. Per the CDC web site : Wildfire smoke can harm you in multiple ways. Smoke can irritate your respiratory system, and worsen chronic heart and lung diseases. Wildfire smoke is a mix of gases and fine particles from burning vegetation, building materials, and other materials. Fires can significantly increased toxic co ozone gas , and particulate levels during fire events. Analyses of observations to further probe the magnitude of ozone, ozone precursor, and particulate matter enhancements due to fires. Since the lifetime of CO is long, even the magnitude of the observed enhancement ratios of black carbon and NOy are consistent with loss of less than one-half of the emitted black carbon and nitrogen oxides (i.e., very efficient long-distance transport of the fire emissions. For nitrogen oxides, it implies a potential for large-scale impacts on tropospheric ozone, since most of NOy is believed to be peroxyacetyl nitrate, PAN52,53, which thermally decomposes. <br/>If we are to protect wildlife and Humans, we must reconsider Wildfire Science has toxic chemical to the Ozone. California Wildfires are the result of decades of fire suppression, coupled with unprecedented fuel buildups due to a lack of forest management activity. Forests in the United States store an estimated 43,126 Tg carbon in live and dead biomass and soil organic matter. These catastrophic fires destroy valuable timber resources but also degrade many of the other uses of healthy forests. Because of the highly flammable nature of the understory vegetation as well as the canopy fuels, forest type represents a major portion of the area burned in a region. Due to the large amount of fuel stored in the organic soils of many forest stand types, forest floor fuel consumption can be very high. <br/> Typically the amount of carbon dioxide carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) released from fires can be estimated. By separating carbon pools and combustion type, these fundamental variables are accounted for within the model parameter set. <br/>The following equations are used. where: A = area burned (hectares, ha) Ca = carbon density of the aboveground component (assumed to be 0.5 of biomass; t ha-1), Cg = carbon density of the organic material found in the ground-layer, which is composed of the litter and duff layers (t ha-1), a and g = proportions of the aboveground vegetation and ground-layer organic carbon, respectively, consumed in the burn, Efg = emission factor for each of three gas species, CO2, CO, and CH4 (in units of gas released per unit of carbon consumed) The analysis using (2) is carried out for each gas independently. The f and s subscripts on the emission factor terms in (2) refer to blazing and smoldering combustion, respectively. The first step in calculating total stand fuel consumption is to determine surface fuel consumption, represented by the sum of fuel consumed in organic soil (or duff), surface litter, dead and downed coarse woody debris (logs), and dead and downed medium woody debris (branches). Each of these stand components has a separate fuel consumption algorithm. Surface fire intensity is calculated by applying the total surface fuel consumption and fire rate of spread to intensity equation. CO is a predictor of other fire emissions products (regression r2 values were: 0.84, 0.98, 0.87 for CH4, NMHC, and PM2.5 respectively). The CH4 regression shows the characteristically high r2 value for these gases that has been observed for most prescribed a wildland fires measured in the contiguous United States. The r2 value of 0.98 indicates that variation in CO concentration highly predicts NMHC concentration. Can help in interpretation of atmospheric measurements of pollutants.<br/><br/>",

    "text": "The FMCSA would serve the industry and motoring public much better if they would quit demonizing the professional driver and start listening to us instead of listening to lobbying organizations like the ATA who only represent corporations who provide goods and services to the trucking industry.  As a driver with over 30 years of experience it&#39;s my informed opinion that ELDs are a bad idea to start with.  If a driver needs an electronic baby sitter while he&#39;s at work then he needs to find something else to do for a living.    If a driver needs an electronic device to tell home when to stop, go, eat, take a break or sleep he needs to find another more structured line of work.  So far, the roll out of this regulation has been equivalent to the roll out of obamacare.   It&#39;s  a shame that there&#39;s such a low acceptable standard for the roll out of new regulations especially when we the people who actually work in the industry are paying the price for it.  There are so many other safety related issues that need to be addressed before implementing another form of corporate welfare.   But what have we seen from ELDs so far?  Far more trucks parked on the shoulder of highways, more truck stops charging for parking, more accidents,  more frustration, more anxiety, drivers not taking breaks until it&#39;s mandatory,  more stops by DOT cops just to figure out how different ELDs operate, more drivers being forced into bad situations,  less patience,  and lower wages.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve missed a lot of issues but this is only the obvious.   As far as personal conveyance,  a driver should be able to use his assigned vehicle whether unladen or laden for food, fuel, rest, repairs, entertainment,  medical needs, to move the truck to a safe place, to go home, and other activities as the drivers sees fit, whether it advances the load or not.  Many times these are most important functions to driver welfare and safety and such decisions need to be left to the discretion of the driver.  It&#39;s time the FMCSA starts looking to the drivers for solutions instead of look8ng to unions, lobbyists for special interests, and uninformed bureaucrats. ",

I have filed noise complaints routinely with the Port of Seattle. My understanding is those comments are forwarded on to the FAA. Whats unclear is what happens with the complaints. There could be some valuable insights, but those certainly werent used in the last Part 150 as far as I could tell.<br/>So, regarding the proposed change, in theory it sounds good. But the mystery is whether these proposed changes would actually do any good. An unknown also is whether the new process for aggregating complaints will lead to a dumbing down  of the data, making the data even less usable for analysis.  Indeed, I wonder if this is a part of the process to shove Nexgen through. By making it hard to assess and analyze complaints, it may be easier to say look, there are no problems because theres no complaint data that indicates theres a problem.<br/>I have a suggestion. Lets have an open process where citizens concerned about noise can submit a variety of noise complaint forms and processes for follow up to those noise forms. Then, post them all, with an opportunity for people to vote and comment on the various options. <br/>I have read through comments others have submitted. Some are very hard to understand, but some have some great insights. I want to highlight in particular comments just submitted by Steve Edmiston. He wrote: <br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>The Federal Register summary and supplemental information states:<br/>The purpose of the FAA Noise Portal is to allow the FAA to more efficiently and effectively respond to and address noise complaints or inquiries in a clear, consistent and repeatable manner that is responsive to the public and applies the best use of FAA resources.<br/>This statement demonstrates how the creation of the portal places the cart before the horse. The issue to be addressed is what the FAA defines as efficiently and effectively responding to complaints in a clear, consistent and repeatable manner that is responsive to the public. Developing standards and practices around what is an adequate FAA response is the real issue; creating a portal may or may not serve this objective. The ultimate problem is simple: if the FAA does not intend to take actual noise-reduction action in response to complaints over excess noise (i.e., if it will only be sending a form response that references a prior Part 150 study, for example), then the portal quite fairly seems to be a way for the FAA to avoid actually addressing the substance of the problems. <br/>Please work on creating and defining new and real engagement and real improvements for communities impacted by noise, first. Noise is not an annoyance. All new studies of aircraft noise from around the globe are finding associations between aircraft noise and sleep loss, hypertension and heart ailments, and the cumulative noise and emissions from airports are a deadly combination. Please dont use a process  a portal  as a substitute for seeking solutions that are, in your words, responsive to the public.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>I believe he makes an excellent point. Figure out what youre going to do with the data, then lets figure out the collection procedure and data fields that will most help citizens.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Stuart Jenner <br/>",
