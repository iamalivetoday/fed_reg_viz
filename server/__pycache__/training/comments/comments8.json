    "text": "On behalf of the Missouri Nurses Association, we urge withdrawal of the proposed federal rules to the Title X family planning program.  The Missouri Nurses Association, a constituent member of the American Nurses Association, has been in existence for over one hundred years, and is the only full-service professional organization representing Missouri&#39;s 100,000-plus registered nurses.  Our mission is to protect and enhance registered professional nursing practice in all environments to assure quality, affordable and accessible health care for people in Missouri.  Key program areas of the association include legislation and governmental affairs, accreditation and provision of continuing nursing education, professional development and supporting nursing practice and research.<br/><br/>Title X is an innovative and highly successful program that has provided quality contraception, cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings, and medically accurate education and counseling to over 4 million individuals across the country each year for nearly 50 years. Title X is a vital part of the health care safety net that serves those who are low-income, uninsured, and underserved.  As a member of the health care community who serves the needs of all Missourians, these changes would drastically affect our state.<br/><br/>These rules are dually harmful, negatively impacting both the Title X provider network, as well as the delivery of timely, accurate health information to Title X patients. We are extremely troubled by the current proposed changes to the Title X program, specifically undermining the standards of care by permitting Title X projects to refuse to provide the broad range of contraceptive methods that have been a core part of Title-X funded services since the programs inception.  We also take umbrage with threatening patient confidentiality, particularly for minors, in ways that could cause many patients to avoid seeking care in Title X settings.<br/><br/>The consequences of the proposed rule change would be swift and dramatic. Unintended pregnancies (which are at an all-time low) and STDs (which are already on the rise) could see significant increases. The change from non-directional, non-judgmental counseling would harm the patient/provider relationship, perhaps steering people away from Title X health care altogether. The repercussions this could cause to low-income persons and families may be irreversible.  <br/><br/>The health care safety net is already strained in our state, especially since Missouri has yet to expand Medicaid. The safety net cannot absorb additional patients if qualified providers are intentionally removed from the network.  These proposed changes would add more demand, while also ensuring less supply  an equation that does not work. It will cause the safety net to break.  Considering the current rural and urban health care adequacy and safety net challenges in our state, we cannot afford to adopt these changes to Title X in Missouri.  Again, we respectfully ask withdrawal of these proposed rule changes.   <br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/> <br/>Heidi N. Lucas<br/>State Director<br/>Missouri Nurses Association <br/>",

    "text": "Dear Secretary Azar, <br/><br/>The New York City Councils Progressive Caucus submits this letter in opposition to the recently released Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would enact a domestic gag rule and block women and families in New York City from accessing critical health care they depend on. The proposed rule would effectively block doctors, nurses, hospitals, community health centers, and any other provider in the Title X program from referring or counseling their patients on safe and legal access to abortion care and would impose new rules designed to make it impossible for thousands of New Yorkers to access the full range of their sexual and reproductive health care options. <br/><br/>The nature of this rule is unprecedented and dramatically shifts the priorities of the Title X Family Planning program. The Title X program is the nations only federal funded grant program dedicated to providing sexual and reproductive health services to low-income and uninsured individuals and serves 4 million people each year. The program dictates that health care providers cannot withhold information from patients regarding their pregnancy options. This proposed rule removes that requirement. By blocking individuals from receiving the full scope of their health care options and forcing providers to essentially lie to their patients, you deny individuals who depend on Title X funded services the critical care they need. The rule would also require Title X funded facilities to physically and financially separate Title X project activities from any abortion-related activities. This includes separation of accounting records, examination rooms and facilities, and electronic and paper-based personnel records. The existing separation requirements in the Title X program are more than sufficient and no additional requirements are necessary. We ask that HHS evaluate the ways in which this provision will affect how health care is delivered, especially during a time where the country is moving towards providing care in a more holistic, coordinated way. In New York City, we have worked to ensure individuals have access to care in a multifaceted way by developing health care delivery models that depend on partnerships and often co-location within facilities. These draconian provisions are not only dangerous, they are unnecessary and undermine the progress made in health care delivery.  <br/><br/>In New York City, about 150,000 individuals receive services from Title X organizations each year. Approximately 91% of these individuals are women, 60% have incomes below the federal poverty line, and 32% lack health insurance. Through Title X funding, New Yorkers have access to pregnancy testing and options counseling, gynecological care, HIV and STI testing, cancer screenings, contraception counseling, educational resources, and other critical health care services. There are 22 Title X funded organizations in New York City that operate over 50 health care centers throughout the five boroughs. Of those 22 organizations, 10 are a part of NYC Health and Hospitals, the public health care system millions of New Yorkers depend on. If a Title X funded organization decides to forgo funds in order to continue to provide the full scope of medically accurate health information to their patients, there is an increased possibility of that center closing due to reduced funding . This will leave thousands of New Yorkers without access to health care providers in their communities they trust and depend on. We ask that HHS analyze the capacity of Federally Qualified Health Centers to potentially absorb these patients of these closed health centers and maintain the same level of quality care they previously enjoyed.   <br/><br/>We ask that HHS consider the unique impact this rule will have on New York City and other densely populated cities around the country who often experience high rates of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies, especially amongst youth. Title X funding has been instrumental in addressing these rates by funding organizations that provide medically accurate and age appropriate health and education services. If enacted, this rule will dramatically impact how health care is provided in New York and could lead to higher incidences of STI  and HIV/AIDS infections, unintended pregnancies, breast and cervical cancers. This is particularly dangerous for women and communities of color who have historically been denied equitable health care and depend on Title X funded services for unbiased care. Loss of Title X services may exacerbate disparities for already medically underserved communities.<br/><br/>We ask that HHS fully evaluate the burden this rule poses to the thousands of New Yorkers who depend on unbiased care the Title X program provides. We also ask that HHS recognize the urgency of this matter and the danger this rule poses to the millions of Americans that rely on Title X funded services. <br/> <br/>New York City Councils Progressive Caucus<br/>",

    "text": "Dear Secretary Azar,<br/><br/>I am writing to strongly oppose the Proposed Rule released by the Department of Health and Human Services entitled Compliance With Statutory Program Integrity Requirements (HHS-OS-2018-0008). The Proposed Rule would make radical changes to the Title X federal family planning program that could significantly impede access to time-sensitive and essential health care for the millions of low-income individuals that are served by the program each year. Californias Title X program is the largest and most comprehensive Title X system in the nation that serves over 1,000,000 patients at over 350 health centers throughout the state. Title X funding saves California approximately $1.3 billion annually in costs related to unintended pregnancy. <br/><br/>As a nurse, I oppose the Proposed Rule for the following reasons:<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Patients need and deserve comprehensive information to make informed decisions about their health in a timely manner in order to achieve their reproductive goals and optimal health outcomes. If enacted, the Proposed Rule will force Title X grantees to not only withhold accurate information about abortion, but to also steer patients to providers that may not offer the treatment they need. It will also force many qualified providers to discontinue participation in the program and will result in gaps in care in regions throughout California and the country.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Title X patients must have access to comprehensive, patient-centered family planning care. The Proposed Rule allows entities to receive Title X funding even if they only provide a single method of contraception, rather than a broad range of birth control methods. Studies show that women who are able to use the method of their choice are more likely to use that method correctly and consistently, and in turn, greatly reduce their risk for unintended pregnancy. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Teens must have access to Title X providers that they can trust to provide quality, teen-friendly care in their local communities. The Proposed Rule requires Title X providers to collect and document personal and private information that could harm the relationship between doctors and patients and discourage patients  particularly teens - from obtaining essential family planning and related services. This will likely lead to increased rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs among adolescents and increased government costs.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Separation requirements must not deny Title X patients timely access to qualified providers. The extreme physical separation requirements included in the Proposed Rule will eliminate qualified providers from the Title X program. This could greatly reduce access to care. If all qualified family planning providers that also provide abortion services were to be eliminated from the Title X family planning program in California, 19 California counties would be left without a Title X-funded health center and many local health systems would find it difficult to absorb the patients left behind as a result.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Limited Title X resources must be reserved for low-income individuals in need of publicly supported family planning services. Congress established the Title X program to create a pathway for low-income and uninsured individuals to access family planning care. The Proposed Rule seeks to allow women to receive family planning services under the Title X program if their employer refuses to cover contraceptive care based on religious or moral objections, regardless of their income. Redefining low income to include this population will divert scarce resources away from serving the low-income patients at the heart of Title Xs purpose. <br/><br/>For these reasons and more, I urge you to rescind the Proposed Rule and maintain the Title X program as Congress intended, to expand access to low-income individuals in need of essential family planning services that promote public health and save taxpayer dollars.<br/><br/>J.

    "text": "I am writing to respectfully encourage you not to move forward with this proposed rule (RIN 1024-AE38). It would repeal a scientifically sound rule from 2015 prohibiting the use of some of the cruelest hunting tactics against predators on national preserves in Alaska. Such tactics include killing mother bears and cubs at den sites with the aid of artificial light, baiting brown and black bears, killing wolves and coyotes with pups during their denning season, killing swimming caribou or killing caribou from a motorboat, and using dogs to hunt black bears.&lt;p&gt;Allowing the use of brutal hunting tactics on highly vulnerable wildlife, such as denning mothers and cubs, is not only unconscionable, but also unlawful. Congress provided a clear directive to the National Park Service to &#39;provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation&#39; for the &#39;benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations&#39; (16 U.S.C. 3101(a)). These extreme hunting methods, which are neither used nor endorsed by the majority of sport hunters, violate this directive.&lt;p&gt;These barbaric, scientifically baseless, and unnecessary tactics decimate predators on public lands and undermine protection of natural diversity solely to boost numbers of prey species and cater to trophy hunters. Predators play a critically important role in an ecosystem, ensuring both diversity and proper ecosystem function. Brutal hunting methods such as baiting, hounding, killing young animals, and killing animals at their den sites should have no place on national preserve lands.&lt;p&gt;The 2015 NPS rule is consistent with federal law and the best available science, was subject to public review and comment, and outlaws only the most extreme hunting tactics in Alaska. I strongly encourage NPS to reject this deeply troubling proposal, and urge the agency to keep the 2015 prohibitions in place.",

I am writing to oppose changes that would weaken safety regulations enacted in 2016 and compromise worker safety and increase the risk of a catastrophic oil spill.<br/><br/>Endangering our oceans and coastal communities in the interest of industry profits would be a terrible betrayal of public trust.",

This rule would prevent that. Abortion is not family planning. This rule would draw a bright line between abortion and family planning, as was clearly intended in the law. <br/><br/>In addition, Live Action&#39;s recent report, Aiding Abusers, showed how Planned Parenthood facilities across the country -- including those that receive Title X funds -- have been deliberately failing to report suspected child sexual abuse and rape for decades. This is despite the fact that the Title X program has repeatedly made clear the expectation that recipients follow all state and local law to report such abuses. <br/><br/>Rather than reporting suspected abuse to authorities, Planned Parenthood has repeatedly looked the other way, performed abortions on victims as young as 12 years old, and then returned those victims to their abusers. Planned Parenthoods repeated failure to report such incidents has allowed abusers to continue abusing their victims, often for years.<br/><br/>This reputation has led to Planned Parenthood becoming a place where sexual abusers and sex traffickers take their victims to cover up their crimes. Why are we funding this with our tax dollars?<br/><br/>Title X funding should be redirected to more worthy and accountable health centers, such as local health departments and nonprofit rural and community health care centers.<br/><br/>I strongly urge adoption of the rule.",

    "text": "I write in strong support of the proposed Protect Life Rule.<br/><br/>We have been told for years that taxpayer funds don&#39;t pay for abortions, yet they help pay for abortion facilities, equipment, and staff salaries. This rule would prevent that. Abortion is not family planning, it is instead the mutual destruction of the family via discouragement of lasting and committing monogamous heterosexual unions, the results of which are pregnancies, and the denial of the basic human fundamental right to life, an inheritance that is inalienable as it does not derive from human powers.  Its deprivation has long been noted and corrected as murder in all instances where it has been unjustly deprived.  What our nation engages in currently is the denial of that right by due process, and the added heinous actions of lying to mothers concerning the nature of their human children and the denial of fathers to be fathers for their children, though it was only through the actions of the father that the mother was granted her elevated aforementioned status as such. <br/><br/>This rule would draw a bright line between abortion and family planning, as was clearly intended in the law. <br/><br/>In addition, Live Action&#39;s recent report, Aiding Abusers, showed how Planned Parenthood facilities across the country -- including those that receive Title X funds -- have been deliberately failing to report suspected child sexual abuse and rape for decades. This is despite the fact that the Title X program has repeatedly made clear the expectation that recipients follow all state and local law to report such abuses. <br/><br/>It should be no surprise that when such an erroneous and fundamental denial of life occurs, the so-called public servants of that denial also engage in ludicrous and wicked practices to cover the shame of their programs and services.<br/><br/>Rather than reporting suspected abuse to authorities, Planned Parenthood has repeatedly looked the other way, performed abortions on victims as young as 12 years old, and then returned those victims to their abusers. Planned Parenthoods repeated failure to report such incidents has allowed abusers to continue abusing their victims, often for years.<br/><br/>This reputation has led to Planned Parenthood becoming a place where sexual abusers and sex traffickers take their victims to cover up their crimes. Why are we funding this with our tax dollars?  <br/><br/>Why is the First Amendment and the very ideals detailed in the Declaration of Independence being violated, as millions upon millions of Americans, who willingly put forth funds and activism against the abortion industry in whatever ways they see legally and morally fit, must then combat their own funds that are unjustly used from their taxes to support such a contentious and heinous act of human deprivation?  Is not the first freedom of a human being, should such a being be allowed to live by others more fortunate to have been honored with that inalienable right, to be adequately allowed self-governance as purports to be supported in every liberal society?  Perhaps the United States of America in its present iteration, after overcoming several barriers to this goal, now is content to soil itself with the stench of epic murder as it engages in this practice, the convenience being that when the enslaved person, the native, and the forcibly detained immigrant could cry aloud Am I not a Man/Woman? the unborn child from these parents and more is torn to bits while her or his vocal chords have not sufficiently developed, and none is the wiser but all are made bloodied nonetheless.  <br/><br/>We are sensible enough to fear violating humanity before our Creator to punish those who wish to murder their fellow citizens who are able to scream.  And we are now unjust enough to allow those whose voices can be smothered the most to be executed without trial, even for the crimes of the parent, and to deceive the evidence of our bloodied visages with attempts to label such an action mercy and justice.  Would that we had been so enlightened, there would have been no Frederick Douglass and countless others who have quickened the hearts of millions of US Americans to the fear of their Creator on behalf of their fellow countrymen being murdered and wronged with all federal acceptance.  <br/><br/>Title X funding should be redirected to the individual States for their citizens to decide what are the worthy and accountable health centers, such as local health departments and nonprofit rural and community health care centers.<br/><br/>I strongly urge adoption and full implementation of this rule, by the mercies of our Creator.",

This rule would prevent that. Abortion is not family planning. This rule would draw a bright line between abortion and family planning, as was clearly intended in the law. <br/><br/>In addition, Live Action&#39;s recent report, Aiding Abusers, showed how Planned Parenthood facilities across the country -- including those that receive Title X funds -- have been deliberately failing to report suspected child sexual abuse and rape for decades. This is despite the fact that the Title X program has repeatedly made clear the expectation that recipients follow all state and local law to report such abuses. <br/><br/>Rather than reporting suspected abuse to authorities, Planned Parenthood has repeatedly looked the other way, performed abortions on victims as young as 12 years old, and then returned those victims to their abusers. Planned Parenthoods repeated failure to report such incidents has allowed abusers to continue abusing their victims, often for years.<br/><br/>This reputation has led to Planned Parenthood becoming a place where sexual abusers and sex traffickers take their victims to cover up their crimes. Why are we funding this with our tax dollars?<br/><br/>Title X funding should be redirected to more worthy and accountable health centers, such as local health departments and nonprofit rural and community health care centers.<br/><br/>I strongly urge adoption of the rule.",

    "text": "Dear Secretary Azar, Senior Advisor Huber, and Deputy Assistant Secretary Foley:<br/><br/>As someone who values access to the full range of reproductive health care options, I am writing to oppose the Trump administrations proposed gag rule on health care providers that participate in Title X. The proposed rule would interfere with the patient-provider relationship and deny Title X patients information they need to stay healthy. It is clearly designed to make it impossible for reproductive health-focused providers, including Planned Parenthood health centers and independent clinics, to continue to serve people through the program. The proposed rule would undermine Title Xs goals of providing comprehensive reproductive health services to people with low incomes. Furthermore, the proposed rule disregards the likely costs it will impose on patients, providers, and on society, and would exacerbate existing health disparities.<br/><br/>Title X family planning clinics like Planned Parenthood are critical safety net providers of needed preventive health services, including contraception, cancer screenings, STI detection and treatment, HIV education, and more. These changes will compromise the success of the Title X program and result in patients losing access to high-quality care. Forty-one percent of Title X patients rely on Planned Parenthood for their care; they are an essential safety net provider. Blocking people from getting full and accurate information about all of their options from providers like Planned Parenthood is wrong.<br/><br/>All patients, regardless of their race, of their income, or where they live, deserve the best medical care and information available. For decades, the Title X program has helped people with low incomes have access to basic, preventive reproductive health care. The gag rule would undermine medical ethics and the patient-provider relationship, and doctors could no longer refer their patients to high quality abortion providers, even if their patients ask how to access abortion care. This rule would make it impossible for patients to get birth control or preventive care from trusted providers, with the rules changing the Title X programs current guarantees of full and complete information about pregnancy options.<br/><br/>Patients deserve facts and accurate information about all of their health care options. I urge you to oppose finalization of these rules.",

    "text": "As someone who objects to my tax dollars subsidizing the abortion industry, I express support for the proposed rule issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on June 1, 2018 to separate abortion practices from the Title X family planning program. This rule is necessary to ensure that taxpayer dollars are no longer entangled in the abortion industry. The President Clinton regulations allowed the Title X family planning program to become a slush fund for abortion organizations. Pro-life organizations have been shut out of the program because they are unwilling to violate their conscience by applying for funds for a program that requires them to referral for abortion. The Clinton regulations must be changed, and I support the regulation removing the abortion referral requirement and replacing it with a restriction on abortion referrals.<br/><br/>Abortion is not family planning. When Congress first authorized the Title X program, and it made clear that abortion should be separate from the family planning program. Title X funds should be completely physically and financially separate from all abortion-related activities, and Title X recipients should no longer be forced to provide abortion referrals or risk defunding.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule requirement that Title X clinics abide by state reporting laws for rape and abuse in order to put a stop to the exploiting of young women and girls, many of whom are brought to Title X clinics for contraception and abortion by their abusers. The proposed rule would ensure that these girls will be protected and their abusers brought to justice.<br/><br/>The majority of American voters do not want their money entwined with the abortion industry. I support this proposed rule that will finally disentangle Title X money from the abortion industry.",

    "text": "I am writing to respectfully encourage you not to move forward with this proposed rule (RIN 1024-AE38). It would repeal a scientifically sound rule from 2015 prohibiting the use of some of the cruelest hunting tactics against predators on national preserves in Alaska. Such tactics include killing mother bears and cubs at den sites with the aid of artificial light, baiting brown and black bears, killing wolves and coyotes with pups during their denning season, killing swimming caribou or killing caribou from a motorboat, and using dogs to hunt black bears.&lt;p&gt;Allowing the use of brutal hunting tactics on highly vulnerable wildlife, such as denning mothers and cubs, is not only unconscionable, but also unlawful. Congress provided a clear directive to the National Park Service to &#39;provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation&#39; for the &#39;benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations&#39; (16 U.S.C. 3101(a)). These extreme hunting methods, which are neither used nor endorsed by the majority of sport hunters, violate this directive.&lt;p&gt;These barbaric, scientifically baseless, and unnecessary tactics decimate predators on public lands and undermine protection of natural diversity solely to boost numbers of prey species and cater to trophy hunters. Predators play a critically important role in an ecosystem, ensuring both diversity and proper ecosystem function. Brutal hunting methods such as baiting, hounding, killing young animals, and killing animals at their den sites should have no place on national preserve lands.&lt;p&gt;The 2015 NPS rule is consistent with federal law and the best available science, was subject to public review and comment, and outlaws only the most extreme hunting tactics in Alaska. I strongly encourage NPS to reject this deeply troubling proposal, and urge the agency to keep the 2015 prohibitions in place.",

    "text": "To Whom it May Concern,<br/><br/>Today I write in strong support of the proposed rule titled: Compliance With Statutory Program Integrity Requirements (HHS-OS-2018-0008), also known as the Protect Life Rule.<br/><br/>The proposed rule seeks to reinstate Reagan-era prohibitions on Title X funding for abortion centers. Similar regulations were upheld by the Supreme Court in 1991 in Rust v. Sullivan (500 U.S. 173).<br/><br/>Abortion is not family planning. This rule would draw a bright line between abortion and family planning, as was clearly intended in the statute.<br/><br/>Currently 266 Planned Parenthood abortion centers are also federal Title X locations. Planned Parenthood is the nations largest abortion business and receives $50-$60 million a year from Title X. They should not be entitled to treat Title X as their personal slush fund. Research released by the Charlotte Lozier Institute in 2018 shows Planned Parenthood has inflated the U.S. abortion rate, controlling more than 35% of the abortion industry and resulting in more than three million extra abortions that could have been avoided.<br/><br/>American taxpayers do not want to be complicit in abortions through their taxpayer dollars. According to a January 2018 Marist poll, six in ten Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion. Money is fungible and tax dollars should be invested in comprehensive health care alternatives, not used as a slush fund to prop up the abortion industry.<br/><br/>It&#39;s important to note that the proposed rule will not reduce family planning funding by a single dollar. This rule would simply direct taxpayer funds to family planning providers who stay out of the abortion business. Women and girls are best served at alternative health care centers including community and rural health care centers that outnumber Planned Parenthood abortion facilities by more than 20 to 1 nationwide.<br/><br/>I strongly urge adoption of the rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Angelica Barragan<br/>Florida",

Health centers that receive Title X funding provide important services including contraception, well-woman exams, cancer screenings, and pregnancy counseling. Access to this care is essential for women&#39;s health, and should never be politicized. Under this proposed change, 40% of Title X patients may lose access to critical primary and preventive care services, and all women seeking care at Title X funded health centers risk losing access to services and information necessary to make informed decisions about own health. Politicians have no place in the exam room, nor should they restrict the information my health care provider can tell me, or make it more difficult for me to access the care I need.
