The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people.

    "text": "Dear Secretary Ross:  I strongly urge you to uphold the designations made by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

By restoring fisheries, protecting against the dangers of offshore oil drilling, and providing a buffer against climate change, marine sanctuaries are critical to the entire nations economy, health, and security. <br/><br/>Since President Nixon established the National Marine Sanctuary Program, bipartisan support from communities, Congress, and presidents has been critical to designate and expand marine sanctuaries. An attack on any marine sanctuary is an attack on the very fabric of American democracy. Please stand with the communities who advocated for marine protections and the people who support national marine sanctuaries and monuments.    ",

Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

Science has shown that National Marine Protected Areas, such as Papahnaumokukea and the Pacific Remote Islands, help to maintain balanced marine ecosystems and preserve fish and wildlife populations. Monument waters protect ecosystems for 7,000 species, many of which are currently endangered. There is strong scientific evidence that Marine Protected Areas are good for the long term stability of ecosystems, US fisheries, and subsequently are good for the US economy and US food security. Please consider the scientific evidence when making your policy decision. Please also consider the fact that the American public is overwhelmingly in support of these protections.",

    "text": "Dear Secretary Ross:  I strongly urge you to uphold the designations made by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

    "text": "Dear Secretary Ross:  I strongly urge you to uphold the designations made by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

As a retired scientist who enjoys nature and the outdoors, I believe it is essential that we preserve such areas as the Channel Islands Marine National Sanctuary as part of our heritage for our children and grandchildren to enjoy, and to preserve the resources protected by this National Monument for future generations.   The size necessary to protect these important resources has been determined by extensive scientific input.  Furthermore, this Sanctuary is a very modest size!<br/><br/>One important function of this sanctuary is the protection of deep sea corals and other foundational species from anthropogenic disturbances such as bottom trawling and mining extractions. Furthermore, the islands of Channel Islands Marine National Sanctuary are an important tourist attraction and directly and indirectly provide much business to this coastal area.   It is vital to protect this important resource from despoilment and loss so that we may benefit from research carried out there and hopefully future generations can continue to enjoy the same diversity of life that we do.  There is no valid reason to reduce the size of this Sanctuary or decrease its level of protection.<br/><br/>Please oppose any effort to reduce protection on the Channel Islands Marine National Sanctuary.<br/><br/>",

They are an indispensable economic driver for coastal and ocean communities, generating $8 billion annually through commercial fishing, tourism, and recreation activities within protected areas. By restoring fisheries, protecting against the dangers of offshore oil drilling, and providing a buffer against climate change, marine sanctuaries are critical to the entire nations economy, health, and security. <br/><br/>Since President Nixon established the National Marine Sanctuary Program, bipartisan support from communities, Congress, and presidents has been critical to designate and expand marine sanctuaries. An attack on any marine sanctuary is an attack on the very fabric of American democracy. Please stand with the communities who advocated for marine protections and the people who support national marine sanctuaries and monuments.    ",

If we ignore this and begin drilling for energy and mineral exploration, this will jeopardize these national monuments and sanctuaries. It would be irresponsible to allow this to happen and I believe the Trump administration is making a huge mistake by rolling back these protection orders. I feel the focus should be on more renewable resources that the United States should be exploring, rather than devastating our oceans with underwater drilling and exploration. I urge you to stop this and think about the future of our oceans and earth.<br/><br/>The country&#39;s marine national monuments and sanctuaries, home to a tremendous diversity and richness of ocean life, are of significant scientific, historic, and cultural value. Designated under the Antiquities Act, these National Monuments and sanctuaries constitute the first generation of blue parks bestowed on our nation.<br/> <br/>An attempt to roll back protections in order to allow energy and mineral exploration or commercial fishing in any one of these monuments and sanctuaries imperils our country&#39;s cultural and scientific legacy and natural heritage. We strongly urge you to maintain the current protections for all marine national monuments and sanctuaries. <br/><br/>Our diverse U.S. marine monuments and sanctuaries protect a rich array of ocean species and their habitats, including deep sea ecosystems considered to support some of the rarest and unique ecological communities in the world. These habitats in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts are home to sperm whales, Atlantic puffins, and lush deep sea coral gardens, including one of the planet&#39;s oldest organisms, black corals. Other species may contain chemical compounds of biomedical importance. The Pacific monuments protect hundreds of seamounts (underwater mountains), which are hotspots of biodiversity, and places like the Marianas Trench are home to hydrothermal vents, active volcanoes, and the deepest trench on the planet. These sensitive ecosystems are some of the least explored in the world.  Maintaining these monuments and sanctuaries&#39; boundaries allows for the continued discovery of new deep sea species in addition to providing nursery and spawning habitats for commercially valuable fish while also protecting thousands of threatened species.  <br/><br/>I am confident that your review pursuant to President Trump&#39;s Executive Order will find that each marine national monument and sanctuary was established with broad public support and adequate consultation with Federal, State, and tribal governments.  <br/><br/>I write to add my voice and show the strong public desire that monuments and sanctuaries not be altered or eliminated, and that the U.S. maintain all of the current protections for these diverse marine ecosystems.

Thus, GSP saving 6% for Thai goods enhance competiveness among imported product in the U.S.<br/>For Thai petrochemical industry, we export petrochemicals product about 5 million tons per year. (For SCG chemicals, mainly export products to USA are Polypropylene and PVC compound) The benefits of GSP affect to our customer in USA as a result of 6% lower cost for plastics material. So, there are substantial reasons to describe how GSP contribute to our business and market opportunity. <br/>Firstly, petrochemical and plastic industries able to contribute to economic growth for developing countries due to they are one of mainly portion of GDP growth.

Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

They are an indispensable economic driver for coastal and ocean communities, generating $8 billion annually through commercial fishing, tourism, and recreation activities within protected areas. By restoring fisheries, protecting against the dangers of offshore oil drilling, and providing a buffer against climate change, marine sanctuaries are critical to the entire nations economy, health, and security. <br/><br/>Since President Nixon established the National Marine Sanctuary Program, bipartisan support from communities, Congress, and presidents has been critical to designate and expand marine sanctuaries. An attack on any marine sanctuary is an attack on the very fabric of American democracy. Please stand with the communities who advocated for marine protections and the people who support national marine sanctuaries and monuments.    ",

These values must be considered in any review of the monuments.it seems that the questions asked and considered focus on extractive resources, rather than those values for which the monuments were designed to protect for future generations, or the potential (and current) economic value of recreation and tourism. <br/><br/>I am familiar with many, but not all of the monuments under review, and those resources far outweigh whatever gains might be made by exploiting them for short-term gain. These are magnificent landscapes, worthy of protection, and far more valuable--both economically AND biolocally--in their current state . For example, since the Grand Staircase Escalante NM was established, tourism in the area has increased significantly, benefitting the local community far more than whatever extraction of non-renewable resources might have offered. The same is true for the Grand Canyon Parashant NM, Gold Butte, and Bears Ears. <br/>Leave them as they are. Man can only mar them, and they are far more valuably to this generation and those to come, if maintained in their current condition. <br/>",

Designated under the Antiquities Act, these National Monuments and sanctuaries constitute the first generation of blue parks bestowed on our nation.<br/> <br/>An attempt to roll back protections in order to allow energy and mineral exploration or commercial fishing in any one of these monuments and sanctuaries imperils our country&#39;s cultural and scientific legacy and natural heritage. We strongly urge you to maintain the current protections for all marine national monuments and sanctuaries. <br/><br/>Our diverse U.S. marine monuments and sanctuaries protect a rich array of ocean species and their habitats, including deep sea ecosystems considered to support some of the rarest and unique ecological communities in the world. These habitats in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts are home to sperm whales, Atlantic puffins, and lush deep sea coral gardens, including one of the planet&#39;s oldest organisms, black corals. Other species may contain chemical compounds of biomedical importance. The Pacific monuments protect hundreds of seamounts (underwater mountains), which are hotspots of biodiversity, and places like the Marianas Trench are home to hydrothermal vents, active volcanoes, and the deepest trench on the planet. These sensitive ecosystems are some of the least explored in the world.  Maintaining these monuments and sanctuaries&#39; boundaries allows for the continued discovery of new deep sea species in addition to providing nursery and spawning habitats for commercially valuable fish while also protecting thousands of threatened species.  <br/><br/>I am confident that your review pursuant to President Trump&#39;s Executive Order will find that each marine national monument and sanctuary was established with broad public support and adequate consultation with Federal, State, and tribal governments.  <br/><br/>I write to add my voice and show the strong public desire that monuments and sanctuaries not be altered or eliminated, and that the U.S. maintain all of the current protections for these diverse marine ecosystems. These unique places benefit all Americans, including future generations. <br/><br/>I urge you to support the following list of marine national monuments and sanctuaries and recommend the boundaries and protections remain as they are today.

The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people.

Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people.

    "text": "Dear Secretary Ross:  I strongly urge you to uphold the designations made by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study.

    "text": "Dear Wilbur Ross,<br/><br/>The country&#39;s marine national monuments and sanctuaries, home to a tremendous diversity and richness of ocean life, are of significant scientific, historic, and cultural value. Designated under the Antiquities Act, these National Monuments and sanctuaries constitute the first generation of blue parks bestowed on our nation.<br/> <br/>An attempt to roll back protections in order to allow energy and mineral exploration or commercial fishing in any one of these monuments and sanctuaries imperils our country&#39;s cultural and scientific legacy and natural heritage. We strongly urge you to maintain the current protections for all marine national monuments and sanctuaries. <br/><br/>Our diverse U.S. marine monuments and sanctuaries protect a rich array of ocean species and their habitats, including deep sea ecosystems considered to support some of the rarest and unique ecological communities in the world. These habitats in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts are home to sperm whales, Atlantic puffins, and lush deep sea coral gardens, including one of the planet&#39;s oldest organisms, black corals. Other species may contain chemical compounds of biomedical importance. The Pacific monuments protect hundreds of seamounts (underwater mountains), which are hotspots of biodiversity, and places like the Marianas Trench are home to hydrothermal vents, active volcanoes, and the deepest trench on the planet. These sensitive ecosystems are some of the least explored in the world.  Maintaining these monuments and sanctuaries&#39; boundaries allows for the continued discovery of new deep sea species in addition to providing nursery and spawning habitats for commercially valuable fish while also protecting thousands of threatened species.  <br/><br/>I am confident that your review pursuant to President Trump&#39;s Executive Order will find that each marine national monument and sanctuary was established with broad public support and adequate consultation with Federal, State, and tribal governments.  <br/><br/>I write to add my voice and show the strong public desire that monuments and sanctuaries not be altered or eliminated, and that the U.S. maintain all of the current protections for these diverse marine ecosystems. These unique places benefit all Americans, including future generations. <br/><br/>I urge you to support the following list of marine national monuments and sanctuaries and recommend the boundaries and protections remain as they are today.

For one, the rich array of sea life in these regions supports both tourism as well as commercial fishing enterprises. For another, the environmental risks to these areas should be weighed against the desires and interests of the states with which they are associated. If it&#39;s not in their interest to open these areas to offshore drilling, then honor that. And finally, I believe this is sending the wrong message to future generations and to our allies alike; that we are happy to sacrifice the long term health of our environment for a promise of short term gain. <br/><br/>Please honor a 45 year precedent and do not roll back the protections established by the previous two administrations.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Jason",

I have had the opportunity to visit The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and have viewed both the Channel Islands and the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuaries many times with the latter being almost daily. The expansions of each Marine Sanctuary required years of community input and public collaboration in efforts to increase science-based protections. These protections help to drive our economy through education, employment, recreation and tourism. National marine monuments and sanctuaries provide nursery and spawning habitats for commercially valuable fish while also protecting thousands of threatened species. Lastly, as a public school teacher, I personally know the value of the expansion of the Marine Sanctuaries and the positive affects and motivation they have on students. Their faces light up with inspiration and inquiry when they are exposed to these Marine Sanctuaries and they walk away with the knowledge at the necessary stewardship for maintaining their local environment.

Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe.

The same can be said for other marine sanctuaries. These reserves were put into place to protect our waters from short-sighted overexploitation, which puts our fisheries and coastal economies at risk. <br/><br/>Science has shown that National Marine Protected Areas, such as Papahnaumokukea and the Pacific Remote Islands, help to maintain balanced marine ecosystems and preserve fish and wildlife populations. This in turn feeds back into healthy fisheries and productive coastal economies. <br/><br/>Monument waters protect ecosystems for 7,000 species, many of which are currently endangered. There is strong scientific evidence that Marine Protected Areas are good for the long term stability of ecosystems, US fisheries, and subsequently are good for the US economy and US food security.

Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people.
