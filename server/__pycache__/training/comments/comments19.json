Access to outdoors means just that--access to the outdoors. I am writing today to express my strong opposition to the proposed withdrawal of the Organic Livestock and Poultry Practices final rule. I urge you to reconsider this baseless move to weaken the USDA Organic seal. This action is an assault on organic farmers, businesses, and consumers everywhere. <br/><br/>I rely on a strong USDA Organic seal to know that what I am purchasing is backed by a standard that I can trust. I am willing to put my money where my mouth is, but I expect products bearing the USDA Organic seal to meet rigorous standards.<br/><br/>It&#39;s important to me to know that the same strong standard applies to all organic products regardless of where I buy them. I understand that organic farmers and businesses of all types and sizes overwhelmingly support the final rule, and I find it outrageous that you are making this move to withdraw the rule against their recommendation. The withdrawal endorses a few businesses that deny animals access the outdoors and ignores the millions of consumers who rightly equate animals going outside with the organic label.<br/><br/>I want to support the organic farmers and businesses who share my values, but you are putting that in jeopardy. I urge you to please implement the final rule.",

Although the &quot;organic&quot; label evokes an image of high-level animal welfare, current standards are alarmingly vague or nonexistent. The organics industry is in favor of the rule, with the Organic Trade Association fighting for implementation. The USDA is being led around by a handful of Big Ag corporations and ignoring consumers, farmers, and over 60 million animals. <br/><br/>These standards and certification are entirely within the USDA&#39;s jurisdiction.

    "text": "The  Oceans are actually Cooling , Another bombshell to hit the global warming alarmists and their speculative climate modeling came in Geophysical Research Letters which found that over 20% of the heat gained in the oceans since the mid-1950s was lost in just two years. NASA satellite tropospheric temperature data reveals that the Southern Hemisphere has NOT WARMED in the past 25 years contrary to &quot;global warming theory&quot; and modeling. This new Southern Hemisphere data raises the specter that the use of the word &quot;global&quot; in &quot;global warming&quot; may not be accurate. A more apt moniker for the past 25 years may be &quot;Northern Hemisphere&quot; warming. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the January through June Alaska statewide average temperature was &quot;0.55F (0.30C)  COOLER than the 1971-2000 average. Climatologist noted that the sudden cooling of the oceans &quot;certainly indicates that the multi-decadal global climate models have serious issues with their ability to accurately simulate the response of the climate system to human- and natural-climate forcings.  There have been recent findings in peer-reviewed literature over the last few years showing that the Antarctic is getting colder and the ice is growing and a new study in Geophysical Research Letters found that the sun was responsible for 50% of 20th century warming. Academy of Sciences, predicted long term global cooling may be on the horizon due to a projected decrease in the sun&#39;s output. 60 prominent scientists who question the basis for climate alarmism, clearly explains the current state of scientific knowledge. One of the ways alarmists have pounded this mantra of &quot;consensus&quot; on global warming into our pop culture is through the use of computer models which project future calamity. But the science is simply not there to place so much faith in scary computer model scenarios which extrapolate the current and projected buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and conclude that the planet faces certain doom. Research Center  said that highly publicized climate models showing a disappearing Arctic were nothing more than &quot;science fiction.&quot; The history of the modern environmental movement is chock full of predictions of doom that never came true. We have all heard the dire predictions about the threat of overpopulation, resource scarcity, mass starvation, and the projected death of our oceans. None of these predictions came true, yet it never stopped the doomsayers from continuing to predict a dire environmental future. on the constant doom saying of the global warming alarmists and their media allies. winter in many parts of the U.S. have further put a damper on the constant doom saying of the global warming alarmists and their media allies. the claim that droughts would be more frequent, severe and wide ranging during global warming, has now being exposed as fallacious. A new paper in Geophysical Research Letters authored by Konstantinos Andreadis and Dennis Lettenmaier finds droughts in the U.S. becoming &quot;shorter, less frequent and cover a small portion of the country over the last century scientist and colleagues showed that the interior of Greenland is gaining ice mass.  Also, according to Research Institute, despite all of the media hype, the Arctic was warmer in the 1930&#39;s than today. Media&#39;s unfounded hype, polar bears are not facing a crisis, according to biologist Dr. Mitchell Taylor from the Arctic government of Nunavut. &quot;Of the 13 populations zones of polar bears in Canada, 11 are stable or increasing in number. They are not going extinct, or even appear to be affected at present. New data debunking climate alarmism mounts, the mainstream media chooses to ignore it and instead focus on the dire predictions of the sky-is falling climate scare reports.   the use of &quot;extreme scenarios is a tactic to drive the public&#39;s attention to the false information. global warming alarmists may have significantly overplayed their hand in the climate debate. A  poll found that most Americans do not attribute the cause of any recent severe weather events to global warming, and the portion of Americans who believe that climate change is due to natural variability has increased over 50% in the last five years.",

Greif argued that &quot;the POLITICS of global warming produces the possibility of left-wing FANTASIES of a state of emergency in which we wouldn&#39;t have to go through normal politics in order to get things done.

The banning of a bump stock is the same failed ideology.  You cannot legislate or put a rule on morality.

Congress might make a law which is bad, and the Supreme Court might rule that the bad law is good, but the Executive Branch (that&#39;s you) get to make the decisions about enforcement.  The choice about whether and how to enforce an unconstitutional law is yours.<br/><br/>You might also bring up the militia clause of the 2nd Amendment, which is primarily a justification clause which very concisely summarizes why the operative clause was written -- i.e. to ensure that the people are always well-equipped with milita-style weaponry, so that they can be better prepared for militia activity when called upon.  (I&#39;m sure you already know that &quot;well-regulated&quot; has nothing to do with rules and regulations.  It means &quot;properly functioning&quot; and a militia can only function properly when it has the weapons necessary to do its job.)  In light of the fact that one of the jobs of a militia is to repel invading armies, any weapon which would be useful to that task is therefore protected by the 2nd Amendment, regardless of what Congress or the Supreme Court says on the subject.  A machine gun is certainly appropriate and protected by the 2nd, but since unconstitutional laws are already entrenched, that is no longer an issue.<br/><br/>The issue on the table is what to do about bump stocks.  I say they are the next best thing, and they are exactly the sort of thing that the 2nd Amendment is designed to protect.  The average citizen might be content to have a semi-automatic for hunting, etc., but the 2nd Amendment is not about hunting.

Bump firing does not require any modification of the firearm. Bump firing does not increase the rate of fire of a civilian legal firearm to that of a Class III automatic weapon. It may mimic a higher rate of fire, but it does so utilizing unreliable means.<br/><br/>The action of bump firing does not in any way alter the firearm from its stock configuration or list of standard components. The &quot;bump-stocks&quot; only allow for an ergonomic improvement to the user during the practice of bump firing. They are not meant to increase accuracy. Nor do they increase the rate of fire of a weapon to or beyond what bump-firing without the specialized stock would account for. To consider a reclassification, or outright ban, of devices with such limited impact upon the function of a firearm opens a very expansive gray area within firearm law. It would be a mistake for the ATF to tread into this gray area without significant public input and an act of congress. <br/><br/>Please do NOT expand or reclassify ergonomic accessories as rate-increasing devices.

If California were a country, it would have ranked as the tenth largest user of natural gas worldwide. Natural gas is regarded as the cleanest burning fossil fuel and therefore should be preferred over other sources, so why is it not championed by environmental groups? Instead , they had significant and detrimental impacts on the U.S. gas and oil economy as a whole, and consumers and workers specifically. <br/>In an industrialized and globally competitive world, energy use represents a very real and fixed cost of doing business and more fundamentally, of life. Consumers and businesses have moderated and may continue to moderate their energy use marginally, but in the end, they require energy for survival. More simply, energy is not a luxury; it is a necessity.<br/>The Congressional Joint Economic Committee found that, &quot;environmental laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s, and their subsequent regulations, encouraged utilities to use clean burning natural gas. during this time 90 percent of new power plants were gas-fired in large part as a result of government environmental policies. Some states&#39; percentage of natural gas-dependent electricity was closer to 100 percent, and many of those states were starving for more natural gas. For example all of California&#39;s power plants from 1998-2005 had been natural gas-fired facilities. The U.S. have abundant natural gas resources with trillions of cubic feet , and finding more by the month. America is not running out of natural gas, and it is not running out of places to look for natural gas. America is running out of places where companies were allowed to look for gas. California&#39;s Energy Commission in 2005 report concluded that natural gas has allowed power plant developers &quot;to meet local air quality regulations that implement the federal Clean Air Act.&quot; then the Environmental activist turned against this clean energy, makes no since.<br/>Natural gas has been regarded as the ideal fossil fuel for multiple uses- from electricity generation to manufacturing, in part because of its efficiency, in part because of its relative cleanliness, and in part because of its relatively low delivered cost. For many years, natural gas was a wise and easy choice; America is blessed with an abundant supply and gas burns cleaner and is considered by some to be more environmentally preferable to other fuels. That abundant supply translated to low prices, and those low prices helped fuel a strong and vibrant economy. Most people probably do not realize the importance that natural gas plays in their daily lives. Natural gas is a principal feedstock to several industries including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, the pulp and paper, steel, and fertilizer industries. The most dramatic finding was that U.S. federal laws and policies in Obama administration with regulatory burden had contributed in large measure to the nation&#39;s natural gas crisis. Federal environmental policies have prevented a sufficient and corresponding increase in supply of natural gas. These conflicting federal policies have created an artificial barrier for the market.<br/>After quite literally placing middle income taxpayers on the brink of going out of business the government current is acknowledging the unfortunate fact -we are indeed experiencing an energy regulation crisis from the past administration.<br/>",

The EPA is also proposing the Affordable Clean Energy rule which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE rule would replace the 2015 Clean Power Plan, which EPA has proposed to repeal because it exceeded EPA's authority."

    "text": "The Type 1 Diabetes Defense Foundation (&quot;T1DF&quot;) welcomes the opportunity to submit comments on the Food and Drug Administration&#39;s (&quot;FDA&#39;s&quot;) Draft Guidance. Effective implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (&quot;BPCI Act&quot;) is of importance to the individuals T1DF represents, and we greatly appreciate the FDA&#39;s efforts to provide clarity on the interplay between the new drug approval pathways under the BPCI Act and the existing approval pathways under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&quot;FD&amp;C Act&quot;). <br/><br/>As detailed below and in the attached filed, we do have concerns about (1) the agency&#39;s arbitrary reduction of the scope of &quot;biological products,&quot; as defined in the Public Health Service Act (&quot;PHS Act&quot;) and as amended by the BPCI Act, to a class solely based on the number of amino acids; (2) the resulting misclassification of glucagon as a molecule governed by the FD&amp;C Act instead of the PHS Act; and (3) the bifurcation of approval pathways for analogous biological products, e.g. analog glucagon and analog insulin. To cure the above mentioned deficiencies, T1DF requests the following changes: <br/><br/>1. This Draft Guidance should be withdrawn in its entirety.<br/><br/>2. The definition of a biological product under 42 U.S.C. 262(i)(1), as amended by section 351(i)(1) of the PHS Act, should be clarified to include smaller molecules (less than 40 amino acids) produced via biosynthesis.  <br/>The FDA should delete from its website and documents (see footnote 1) all references to analog glucagon and analog insulin as not being biological products. <br/><br/>3. The FDA should issue a Draft Guidance clarifying the classification of small biosynthesized molecules, including analog glucagon, as biological products analogous to protein under 42 U.S.C. 262(i)(1), as amended by section 351(i)(1) of the PHS Act.<br/><br/>4. The FDA should re-issue a Draft Guidance addressing abbreviated new drug application pathways for small biosynthesized molecules under both the FD&amp;C Act (legacy pathways until 2020) and PHS Act (biosimilar pathways). <br/><br/>5. The FDA should immediately investigate Eli Lilly&#39;s delay to market of Locemia Solutions intranasal glucagon spray, should make the results of its investigation public, as this is a matter of public safety  and interest, and convene a new Patient Engagement Advisory Committee meeting where T1DF offers to articulate the public need for an intranasal glucagon product, particularly in the face of ongoing access barriers to injected emergency glucagon in K-12 school settings.<br/><br/>The Draft Guidance is presented as &quot;assist[ing] potential applicants in determining when an application for a synthetic peptide drug product (synthetic peptide) that refers to a previously approved peptide drug product of recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA ) origin (peptide of rDNA origin)  should be submitted as an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act).&quot; But instead this Draft Guidance seems to assist potential applicants in understanding that the FDA reclassification of analog glucagon precludes the submission of an ANDA under section 505(j) of the FD&amp;C Act, as is stated in the Draft Guidance&#39;s footnote 12. <br/><br/>It is T1DF&#39;s opinion that the 5 peptides subject to this Draft Guidance, glucagon, liraglutide, nesiritide, teriparatide, and teduglutide should not be subject to regulation under the FD&amp;C Act. Instead, they should be regulated under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), as they meet the statutory definition of analogous biological product. <br/><br/>Section 351 of the PHS Act provides authority for the FDA to establish regulatory requirements for marketing biological products. The PHS Act gives precedence to consideration of production technology over molecule size when defining &quot;biological products.&quot; The FDA has similarly emphasized production technologyand related difference in impurity profiles and thus safety approval standards and protocols. <br/><br/>Consistent with these interpretation standards, the 5 peptides covered by this Draft Guidance should be deemed analogous products to biosynthesized protein and should thus be defined as &quot;biological products&quot; within the meaning of  section 351(i)(1) of the PHS Act. <br/><br/>It is thus T1DF&#39;s opinion that an application for a biosynthetic peptide drug product (synthetic peptide) that refers to a previously approved peptide drug product of recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) origin (peptide of rDNA origin) produce via biosynthesis should be submitted as a 351(k) application under the PSH Act rather than as an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) under &quot;section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act),&quot; as suggested by this Draft Guidance. This Draft Guidance should be withdrawn.<br/><br/>T1DF full comment and requested changes attached (T1DF Comment - FDA Docket ID FDA-2017-D-5670 - Glucagon.pdf).",

    "text": "October 24, 2017<br/><br/>The Honorable Dr. Scott Gottlieb <br/>Administrator<br/>Food and Drug Administration <br/>1717 Pennsylvania Ave NW #1025 <br/>Washington, DC 20006 <br/><br/>Dear Administrator Gottlieb, <br/><br/>We are pleased to respond to the Food and Drug Administration&#39;s request for comments on docket number FDA-2017-D-3001, Modified Risk Tobacco Product Applications for IQOS System.<br/><br/>As mothers, we believe this issue is critical to all women, particularly mothers who smoke in the home and around their children. Data shows that women are the primary caretakers of children. Therefore, helping women quit is key to improving not only their health, but also the health of their children. <br/><br/>We understand that children&#39;s health and safety is a priority for the FDA, particularly when it comes to exposure to cigarettes. As mothers, we appreciate the work the agency is doing to better educate teenagers about the negative health consequences of smoking. But the agency can and should do more to help mothers quit.<br/><br/>Sadly, for women, quitting is difficult. Multiple studies show that women have a more trouble than men quitting traditional, combustible cigarettes. Much of the difference is biology. Researchers at the University of Montreal found that women&#39;s menstruation cycle can hamper their attempt to quit traditional cigarettes. Other studies have shown women have much more severe symptoms of withdrawal and are more likely to smoke when facing stress.<br/><br/>When it comes to smoking cessation products, most involve simply replacing inhaled nicotine with a patch or gum. Yet, a study published in the April issue of Archives of General Psychiatry found that those nicotine replacement products don&#39;t always work for women. This is significant because, currently, the FDA only approves these nicotine replacement therapies to help people quit smoking. Clearly, women need additional options, such as products that help replace other cravings and behaviorslike the taste and smell of traditional cigarettes and the hand-to-mouth habits associated with smoking. <br/><br/>FDA needs to recognize the gender differences between men and women and they need to understand that providing women more choices in the marketplace isn&#39;t just a women&#39;s health issue, it&#39;s a children&#39;s health issue too. As such, we urge the FDA to expand the product choices in the marketplace and approve innovative products, like the IQOS e-cigarette.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Stacie Rumenap<br/>President, Stop Child Predators and mother of three<br/><br/>Julie Gunlock<br/>Writer and mother of three<br/>",
