    "text": "I would like to come out against the new rules on payday loans that the CFPB is talking about. I use these loans, and it is important to me that they stay available as I need them. The cost of providing for my family is always increasing. When I can&#39;t afford the costs of feeding my family in between paychecks, I get a pay-day advance. These loans are simple to take out, convenient, and allow me the financial flexibility I need.<br/> <br/>I really don&#39;t like the government putting a cap on how often I use a cash advance as long as I pay them back.  I think this rule could create a lot of problems for people if we cannot get a loan when they need one.<br/> <br/>Clearly the proposed rules on pay day advances are too strict and need to be changed because these loans help so many Americans every day.",

The Countys Internet websites are an important component in providing the public  residents, visitors and businesses  with both information and access to services. To ensure that website visitors with disabilities can access and use the services provided through our websites, the County has an active project to upgrade its current primary and ancillary websites by moving to a new digital platform. The goal is to provide new opportunities for all public engagement. This will be accomplished with a well-defined timeline based on purpose, needs, existing staff and budget. Inclusion and access for individuals with disabilities is paramount in this process. <br/><br/>However, a review of the proposed rule changes reveals two overarching concerns related to constituent services, keeping current with technology, and remaining in compliance with the ADA. First, to address additional requirements generated by the rule changes, the County may have to extend its timeline or pay staff overtime complete the expanded tasks. The other option  a budget buster  would be to hire a web developer and a content management specialist/writer, to put the specific changes into place. Second, an unintended consequence of the rule changes may be a reduction of web content because it may be too costly or too technologically complex to provide services on no longer supported digital platforms. In other words, as technology advances, some website services or information may be discontinued because it may not be practical to manage or maintain old and new platforms for all users. <br/><br/>Monmouth Countys websites are a warehouse of information for residents and it is our intention to continue to make information about programs and services available to all our stakeholders. Thank you for this opportunity to comment. ",

    "text": "Cash loans have worked for me, and I hope the new CFPB rule doesn&#39;t keep me from getting them when I need the money. Many people rely on these loans at times and I don&#39;t know where we would without them. My car has been having a lot of problems recently.  After taking it to the mechanic, the bill was more expensive than I could afford.  I pulled out a payday loan to help me make the payments I needed to and keep my head above water.<br/> <br/>I use my cell phone to communicate with my family and friends, but the bill can sometimes be higher than usual.  Whenever that happens, I have used a payday advance to pay for my bill and avoid late charges or losing service.<br/> <br/>The issue with limiting the number of days that I can use a cash loan is that I can&#39;t predict how long assistance is necessary. The new CFPB rules put me at risk for not receiving enough money when I need it most. This rule would force people like me who depend on cash advances to use less reputable loan options.   It is important to keep all loan options open.<br/> <br/>I encourage you to see these loans as good alternatives and not restrict their use with this rule.",

It is wrong to make it more difficult to get credit. I love my kids but they can be expensive.  There are some months it can be a challenge to pay all my bills.  Cash advances have helped me make sure I can afford to take care of my family and our bills without any problems.<br/> <br/>The CFPB&#39;s new rule that limits the number of days I can have a loan is awful because it seems like the government is trying to limit the only access I have to credit.

How do they know what&#39;s going to happen to me over that year? What if I have an emergency and need some financial help, but am not able to get a loan because of these limits?

I turned to a payday loan to help me pay for some important utility bills.  I knew that I did not want to bounce a check or pay an overdraft fee so the best thing for me to do was to take out the loan and pay it back next pay period.  This worked great for me and saved me more money in the end.<br/> <br/>There shouldn&#39;t be a limit on the number of days I can use a loan. At times, I rely on a payday loan to get myself to my next paycheck. I shouldn&#39;t have to worry that I might not be able to get a loan next time I really need it.<br/> <br/>Please make changes to your rule because a payday loan can make a positive impact on someone&#39;s life.",

There are months that I have trouble paying for it if we go over, so when I need the extra cash I take out a pay day loan.  It helps keep my finances in order and also allows my family to stay in contact.<br/> <br/>Having good insurance coverage can be expensive, but it is something that is very important to me and that I always make sure I have. When I have been in situations when it&#39;s felt like I need a little more time to get my insurance payment made, I have turned to payday loans.<br/> <br/>I do not understand why the CFPB would pass a law to limit the number of cash advances I can get. Without these loans, I will have to borrow money from unsafe sources like online lenders. I do not like this idea because it&#39;s not as safe.<br/> <br/>By restricting payday lenders, the government is only limiting my financial choices.  I hope to continue to use pay day loans in the future and think you should change your rule.<br/> <br/>",

This rule would only hurt us. One of the best solutions to avoiding late utility fees is to be able to pay some bills with a pay day loan. I don&#39;t use it very often but I was glad I did when a problem came up that I wasn&#39;t expecting.  It comes in handy when a long hot summer or a brutal winter increases my power bill.

    "text": "Dear Ms. Bond, <br/>Inbar Group is an Accessibility Consulting Firm based in Israel. We specialize in Internet and Digital Content consulting with a team of experts in the field of Internet Accessibility, most of whom are persons with disabilities. We provide consulting services as well employee training services for organizations and web development companies. Our main focus is to assist such organizations and companies in upgrading their existing website or building a new website to meet the standards outlined in WCAG 2.0.  <br/>The Israeli statutes and regulations regarding accessibility for digital content are applied to both the private and public sector. These statutes and regulations require that new websites meet the standards outlined in WCAG 2.0, level AA as of October 2015. As such, any existing sites must comply with these requirements no later than October 2017 (this date is a recent postponement from the original deadline). <br/>Our team acquired knowledge and experience in the past two years both in the private and in the public sector. Our knowledge and experience is vast as a result of our prestigious clientele including government agencies, local municipalities &amp; international organizations. It is important to note, we are involved in the regulatory and bureaucratic processes in the field, in Israel.<br/>We are interested in bringing to the Department of Justice&#39;s attention one significant issue of concern in the industry. It has become popular to use embedded buttons that are meant to automatically adapt websites to meet the standards of accessibility. This doesn&#39;t refer to buttons which allow you to increase the font size or enhance the contrast on the screen. Rather, this is a system that creates layers of code that enable the entire site to be accessible. For example, you may choose the option of navigating the entire site by using your keyboard. This choice is available on the options menu of the accessibility button system; the system then creates a navigation layer that is essentially accessible according to the standards of the WCAG 2.0. These buttons are marketed as &quot;magical solutions&quot; that enable website owners not to execute any changes in the structure, the code or the design of the website and they save on the cost of the web development. <br/>The problem with this type of solution is that it doesn&#39;t meet the requirement of the WCAG 2.0; that is, that the solution must be implemented within the website&#39;s code. As such, this solution will always be limited in its abilities and will not be compatible with assisting technologies utilized by persons with disabilities. Note, the requirements set forth by the Standard allows for a complete synergy between the website&#39;s code and the assistance technologies. Third party solutions cause trouble for this process.<br/>We found the following issues associated with these buttons:<br/>1. Programs are unable to read the changes set forth by these buttons. This is because the button is transparent for these programs. Therefore, they do not &quot;see&quot; the button and continue to read the original code of the website.<br/>2. The seeing impaired and persons with cognitive disabilities do not understand what changes were made or how they were implemented to the website and they do not know how to activate them. Moreover, because the button is located in one of the corners of the screen, a large portion of this population cannot even see that a button exists. <br/>3. Some browsers ignore the changes created by the button because there are &quot;unnatural&quot; activities on the screen. <br/>4. A person with a number of different disabilities does not get a proper solution. This is because the button divides the disabilities according to dichotomous categories and according to the type of disability. On the other hand, the Standard integrates a number of requirements in order to allow for a wider range of persons with disabilities to browse the website. <br/>5. &quot;Covering&quot; the external technology on the website does not meet the requirements set forth by the Standard. Specifically, that the website needs to meet the needs of persons with disabilities naturally. In other words, it is essential to integrate them within the website. <br/>6. When a person with disabilities uses assistance technologies or any accessibility adaptations built-in programs that he uses (for example, high contrast in the operating system or in the browsers). The button conflicts with the adaptation that the system creates, and, as such, the results only harm and limits the use of the website. <br/>We present the above information to you as experts in the field of internet accessibility as well as persons with disabilities. At this time, when the rules and regulations are not finalized yet in the United States, this issue must be examined; in addition, we strongly recommend that you refrain from settling for these types of solutions.  <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity,<br/>Nadav Bernstein, CEO<br/>Inbar Group - Accessibility<br/>",

They are a simple and convenient credit option for when things come up that I don&#39;t expect.<br/> <br/>I disagree with this new rule from the CFPB telling me how often I can borrow money from a payday lender. If I&#39;m in a bind and need to take out a loan, I should not be restricted by the government.  These rules will only hurt people that depend on cash advances from time to time.<br/> <br/>I urge you to make changes to your proposal for cash advances.

    "text": "Many of these rules are necessary and should be implemented. But in nearly all the proposed rules there is an emphasis<br/>on the payday loan recipient&#39;s providing evidence that he/she will be able to repay the loan in a timely manner. In theory this makes sense, but if the loan comes with the enormous interest rates that payday lenders charge with the obvious consequences which plunge the borrowers deeper in debt. What should happen is competitive loan entities such as Red Dough and community credit institutions which have been created in the St. Louis region and which are expanding their operations. The structure and terms of loans through these agencies are far more beneficial to potential payday loan customers.This still does not answer the problem of eligibility (ability to pay off the original loan) which will likely necessitate other measures, .e.g.. higher minimum wages, a no interest payday loan institution as well as a longer period for repayment.<br/>Stiff regulations  for the borrowers would have to be created to avoid fraud and failure to repay loans, but such alternative<br/>sources would force private lenders to alter their programs or leave the market. In short, as should have been instituted<br/>in the Affordable Care Act, a public option with which private health insurance companies would have to compete.The same<br/>needs to occur in the reform of payday loans.",

With a cash advance, I was able to stock up on food and supplies without having to ask my friends and family for money.<br/> <br/>If there is a mandatory waiting time in between cash advances, there is always going to be the chance that I will have unpredictable expenses that I need to pay for, but won&#39;t be able to due to the waiting period.

But cash advances can help ease the burden, particularly when prices at the supermarket continue to be on the rise with higher energy costs.<br/> <br/>Last month my phone bill was through the roof because of data charges. I had no idea they would charge me as much as they did. In order to pay my bill, I was able to rely on a pay day loan for help and it was the only reason I still have a phone.<br/> <br/>The proposed cooling off by the CFPB will only be restricting for those that depend on payday advances to make ends meet.  People like me often don&#39;t have a lot of options and this would restrict our access to a loan.<br/> <br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my comment. I hope I was able to convince you not to finalize the rule that would change everything about cash advance loans.",

I like using these loans because they are easy to understand and have helped me out of tough situations in the past. I think it is unfair for the government to come in and make it harder for me to borrow money. Home repair costs always catch me by surprise. I use payday loans to help me cover the expenses. For me these loans are ideal for home repairs because they can be taken out in no time and they are easy to pay back after I get my next paycheck.<br/> <br/>The government should not be in the business of capping the number of cash loans I can get. If I pay back all my loans, then I think I should be able to get them when I need them. This is a bad law that will cause a lot of issues.<br/> <br/>I hope you understand how much these loans have helped me in the past.  Please do not take away my ability to use them in the future.",

The Bureau also solicits comment on whether proposed 1041.6(c) and the provisions of proposed 1041.6 more generally would adequately protect against the potential for lenders to make covered loans of different lengths (e.g., a covered short-term loan immediately followed by a 46-day covered longer-term balloon payment loan) in order to avoid operation of the presumptions and prohibitions in proposed 1041.6, and whether the Bureau should impose any additional lending limits to address this concern. <br/>Also, the Bureau seeks amplification on whether to enact a requirement similar to that under proposed 1041.6(h) that would apply where the lender or its affiliate are making, in close proximity, covered short-term loans and covered longer-term balloon-payment loans with a duration of 90 days or fewer. Further, the Bureau requests comment on whether additional provisions or commentary examples should be added to propose 1041.19, which would prohibit lender actions taken with the intent of evading the proposed rule, to address such concerns.<br/><br/>I am including the Wyoming law as an attachment.

As long as I pay everything back on time, the government shouldn&#39;t take away my ability to get a loan.<br/> <br/>A cash loan can make a huge impact for someone so I urge you to reconsider your rule and not take this option away from those of us that need a little help.",

When I got my car it was a proud day, so now I do everything I can to keep it running well. If something goes wrong I try to get it fixed as soon as possible, but whenever I don&#39;t have the money in my budget for the repairs, a pay-day loan helps me make sure my car stays running right.<br/> <br/>My power bill skyrocketed for no reason that I could tell, so I ran and took out a pay day loan to help me pay it that month. I hate how much it goes up sometimes, but thankfully I can take out a loan quickly.<br/> <br/>The new CFPB rule limiting the number of days I can have a loan is wrong.  The government should not be trying to make it more difficult for me to get a payday loan.  This rule will surely create more problems than it will solve.<br/> <br/>By restricting pay day lenders, the CFPB is only limiting my financial choices.  I hope to continue to use these loans in the future and think you should change your rule.",

    "docAbstract": "The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is proposing to amend Regulation P, which requires, among other things, that financial institutions provide an annual notice describing their privacy policies and practices to their customers. The amendment would implement a December 2015 statutory amendment to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act providing an exception to this annual notice requirement for financial institutions that meet certain conditions."
