    "text": "Today&#39;s vehicles emit only about 1% of the pollution than they did in the 1960s, and new innovations continue to improve those engines&#39; efficiency and cleanliness.<br/><br/>And as for that electric car: The energy doesn&#39;t come from nowhere. Cars are charged from the nation&#39;s electrical grid, which means that they&#39;re only as &quot;clean&quot; as America&#39;s mix of power sources. Those are getting cleaner, but we still generate power mainly by burning fossil fuels: natural gas is our biggest source of electricity, and is projected to increase. And coal, while still declining, will remain the second largest source of electricity for some time. (Third is nuclear power, which doesn&#39;t generate emissions but has other byproducts that worry some environmentalists.) Even with large increases in wind and solar generation, the EIA projects that the nation&#39;s electric generating mix will be just 30% renewable by 2030. Based on that forecast, if the EIA&#39;s projected number of electric vehicles were replaced with new internal combustion vehicles, air pollution would actually decreaseand this holds true even if you include the emissions from oil refineries that manufacture gasoline.<br/><br/>There is the concern of nickel mining for the batteries. A 2009 study published in PLOS One concluded that the global warming potential of mining and processing nickel was the eighth highest of 63 metals over the previous year. Not to mention the other harmful chemicals emmited into the air though the process. <br/><br/>Lithium is a tedious process too that requires evaporation pools which release hydrochloric acid and other harmful chemicals into the air, creating a impact on the groundwater around the plants, affecting both humans and the environment around them. 100,000 gallons of fresh water is required to make one tonne of lithium for batteries. There have been plenty of accidents where those pools have leaked into local waterways, affecting those ecosystems even over 100 miles from the facility. There is also a lot of waste leftover after the final product is completed, and very little of it is being recycled.<br/><br/>Cobalt is another essential metal for batteries, and is only found in the Democratic Republic of Congo and central Africa. The people there are the ones who mine it because it&#39;s the only source of income. Many of them work by hand. They don&#39;t use power tools. They don&#39;t wear face masks and often no gloves. There are huge health risks for those people .<br/><br/>If that&#39;s not enough, have you ever asked yourself : &quot;where do all these batteries go after they are no longer used?&quot; As I said before very little of it gets recycled, so they end up in landfills, leak out and impact our impact all around the world outside of where the batteries go from start to landfill.<br/><br/>Basically, the need for emissions testing doesn&#39;t really seem necessary, and could be used to fund the county&#39;s infrastructure instead. Any cars of concern are mainly from other counties or states that drive through the county.",

Members of our LQBTQ+ community are all part of protected classes and the federal government has NO business discriminating against them or any other members of protected classes. The utter disregard for the law by our current administration is beyond repulsive. Please dont add to the toxicity of our country by enabling the discriminatory plans of people like Donald Trump and Mike Pence who believe that their opinions are the only ones people should have. That is not how America works. We were founded on principles of freedom and other peoples ideals should not be forced upon us.",

That is morally wrong. If you are threatened by another persons identity, that is on YOU, to say nothing of the fact that LGBTQ folks do not choose who they are, or who they love any more than right wing Christians do. Giving religious parties the right and ability to discriminate others basically says that their rights to hatred and fear are more important than someone elses right to simply be who they are. If someone wants to discriminate they can..and they can pay their OWN damn bills - without my money!!!",

I urge you to keep the federal Roadless Rule intact and current protections in place for national forests in Alaska. <br/><br/>In addition, I strongly object to your plans to reduce and remove protections from our national forests roadless areas. The Roadless Rule is one of the smartest and most popular land management policies the Federal Government has ever adopted. Not only does it preserve some of Americas best fish and wildlife habitat, but it also saves untold millions of taxpayer dollars that might otherwise be spent to subsidize money-losing timber sales. The value of the Roadless Rule in preventing environmentally damaging and economically wasteful road-building and logging is particularly relevant in the Tongass, where logging costs vastly exceed timber revenues and require unconscionable taxpayer subsidies. <br/><br/>Regards, <br/>kurt willow",

No one should be denied benefits from taxpayers because of someone else&#39;s religious beliefs. It&#39;s quite literally part of the foundation of this country. <br/><br/>Beyond that, if your faith is telling you to deny or withhold, I&#39;d point you to Matthew 25:40-45.<br/><br/>Please, do the right thing.",
