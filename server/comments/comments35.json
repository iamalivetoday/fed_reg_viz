    "docAbstract": "EPA is proposing to add natural gas processing (NGP) facilities (also known as natural gas liquid extraction facilities) to the scope of the industrial sectors covered by the reporting requirements of section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) commonly known as the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (PPA), 42 U.S.C. section 13106. Adding these facilities would meaningfully increase the information available to the public on releases and other waste management of listed chemicals from the natural gas processing sector and further the purposes of section 313 of EPCRA. EPA estimates that at least 282 NGP facilities in the United States would meet the TRI employee threshold (10 full-time employees or equivalent) and manufacture, process, or otherwise use (threshold activities) at least one TRI-listed chemical in excess of applicable threshold quantities. NGP facilities in the U.S. manufacture, process, or otherwise use more than 21 different TRI-listed chemicals, including n-hexane, hydrogen sulfide, toluene, benzene, xylene, and methanol. EPA expects that TRI reporting by United States NGP facilities would provide significant release and waste management data on these chemicals to the public."

What they are asking is whether or not we adulterate our honey with sugar syrups.  If we had an item like &quot;added sugar&quot; on the label it would mislead them into thinking that our honey was adulterated.  We would prefer a term like &quot;total sugar&quot; to represent the sugar in our pure honey product.

Therefore, labels will need to include the same amount of grams of sugar under each category e.g. &quot;17 grams of Total Sugar&quot; and &quot;17 grams of Added Sugars.&quot; This will confuse food consumers.<br/>If this label is implemented at the commercial beekeeping level it will begin the misinformation to food consumers that sugar is added to honey. Eventually, it will create confusion across the honey industry and mislead the consumer about a natural product.<br/>As stated in 21 US Code 342 (b)(4), &quot;A food shall be deemed to be adulterated... if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to...make it appear better or of greater value than it is.&quot; <br/><br/>If consumers are informed through the Nutrition Facts label that honey contains &quot;Added Sugars&quot; then consumers may be led to believe that honey is adulterated, by the regulatory definition, with sugars added to develop or enhance its sweetness.<br/>I realize that honey is added to foods in preparation or manufacturing and in that case it is clearly an added sugar in those foods and would therefore be labeled as &quot;Added Sugars&quot; on the Nutrition Facts label. However, pure honey, itself, does not contain added sugars.<br/>I share the desire for clear, understandable nutrition information to aid consumer choice and promote public health without confusion or misbranding around pure honey. <br/>As a beekeeper I encourage the FDA to consider listing the naturally occurring sugar content of 100% pure honey as a &quot;Total Sugar&quot; and not &quot;Added Sugars.&quot; <br/>",

It is estimated that indoor tanning causes upwards of 400,000 cases of skin cancer in the U.S. each year.  In fact, using indoor tanning beds before age 35 can increase your risk of melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer - by 59% and the risk increases with each use. <br/><br/>I also support the FDA&#39;s proposed risk acknowledgement form that adults would have to sign before using tanning beds and booths.  Quite a bit of misinformation exists on indoor tanning and some people think they are safe and beneficial.  The FDA&#39;s efforts will help correct this misinformation and educate adults about the risks associated with indoor tanning. <br/><br/>Restricting teens&#39; access to indoor tanning and educating all users about the dangers of tanning devices are critical steps to preventing skin cancer.  Together with the FDA&#39;s final rule reclassifying sunlamp products and the proposed rule updating sunlamp performance standards, this proposed rule will make a significant impact in reducing the incidence of skin cancer in the U.S.  I urge the FDA to finalize this proposed rule.",

The tanning salon industry already has many safety precautions in place to protect myself as well as my family members; requiring protective eyewear, tanning limits etc.<br/>I am a user of indoor tanning beds and am well aware of the risks. I do not appreciate that the federal government feels the need to take anymore of my civil liberties by putting restrictions on my pursuit of happiness. <br/>I live in a climate that tends to be cold and dark in the winter and I utilize indoor tanning for my personal well being. There are many studies that have shown UV rays be they fake or real do provide positive health benefits. For me personally, tanning during the long winter months DOES increase my energy and mood.   <br/>I think the government has much better things to worry about, spend money on, as well as spend time making laws about other than my use of indoor tanning beds. <br/><br/>I urge you to please stay out of my personal business. Please, let me take care of MY BODY the way I choose. To utilize indoor tanning as often as I can is MY CHOICE to make not the government&#39;s to take away.<br/>Whats next? Regulations on how many cans of Coke or Pepsi I can purchase and drink per day. There are studies that show sitting in front of computers all day is unhealthy. Eating too much bacon is bad for you. Just getting in my car to drive to work could maybe end in disaster. <br/><br/>Please, I appeal to your common sense that humans around the world are capable of make their own choices and decisions regarding their body and what to do with them and how to take care of them.

    "text": "I am a hobby beekeeper, and also a physician, specializing in diabetes.  I believe that America&#39;s over consumption of sugar is contributing to a crisis of metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes.  Giving consumers a mechanism to see what foods have added sugars, allowing them to be distinguished from natural sugars is a great idea.  However, I am disturbed to hear that pure honey could require such an &quot;added sugar&quot; label.  This reflects a lack of understanding of what honey is and how it is produced.  Unadulterated honey has no added sugar.  The sugar in honey comes directly from the nectar that our bees collect.  The bees partially digest the sugars in the nectar and concentrate it in their hives, producing honey.   The only processing required is to separate the honey from the combs.  Once that is done, the honey can be used raw or heated, but nothing is added. Raw honey may have benefits of improving tolerance to local pollens for pollen allergy sufferers.   Honey producers are not only making their living &quot;growing&quot; honey, but they are providing valuable pollinators in the midst of a pollinator crisis.   At the same time, they are struggling to protect their market from adulterated products that are not pure honey.  Putting &quot;added sugar&quot; on the label of pure honey is not only not accurate, it will confuse consumers, and make it more difficult for them to recognize and purchase pure honey.  Please reconsider requiring an added sugar label for honey.",

    "text": "Dear FDA (most consider you our government, but you are human beings and people with good intentions)<br/>I&#39;m a small sideline beekeeper in northeast Florida.  As a consumer the labeling of sugar in honey is somewhat confusing.  We know it is about 84 percent total (natural) sugars,a few minerals, amino acids, vitamins, yeasts, and water.  It has an acidic pH,and resists natural degradation when sealed from moisture. It can be stored for periods longer than human&#39;s natural lives, and is collected by an insect that lives about 6 weeks on average.  Changing the law with respect to the disclosure of Total and Added sugars of Honey does not on the surface properly inform the public, unless you believe it is more than twice as dangerous a product.  Due to the nature of honey starting its life as nectar (sucrose sugar) from a flower, what does the impact of further labeling Honey with the same amount of added sugars on the label reveal to the consumer?  It has a doubling inference and I do not believe that is the correct form of disclosure, or the intended message of our labeling laws.  As a consumer I do not want a label that is overstated or misleading, that would make me believe that I am consuming something detrimental to my health.  And as a result I would not purchase the product or consume the product.   As a businessman, the implication of added sugar to a product leads me to believe there is adulteration.  There are too many beekeepers who protect their product from the concept of adulteration that will be materially impacted by this reclassification.  So as both a consumer and a beekeeper I would ask and urge you to exempt pure Honey, from the requirement of an Added Sugars disclosure in the proposed label law changes.  I do not believe your intent is to misinform the public, or correct something at a later date that can be resolved prior to the law (FDA 2016-D-4414-0002) taking effect.  There are over four thousand registered beekeepers in Florida.  I would hope all will comment on the proposed changes you are recommending, but know only a few have the time to keep up to date with changing laws until they are required to comply.  I would hope that by the time this letter is read you are already convinced that pure Honey is a unique product and have already made the decision to eliminate the disclosure requirement.  I believe the FDA is the watch dog of the food chain, and that you are making progress by proactively informing the public to improve food safety and personal health.  I also believe you have the public&#39;s best interest in mind when you create new laws.  Thank you for your consideration as to my request.<br/>Respectfully, Don Peppers, Beekeeper<br/>",

    "text": "This &quot;added sugars&quot; rule, if applied to products like honey, will be completely misleading to consumers. I am not a beekeeper nor do I sell honey. But I buy honey and I do read labels. If I lead a label that says &quot;added sugars&quot; to honey, I will assume that this means that sugar has been added to the honey, which, by its very nature, already contains sugar. In fact, no sugar has been &quot;added&quot; to a jar of natural honey because there&#39;s only natural honey, no additional sugar, in the jar. No consumer in the world will realize that the &quot;added sugars&quot; label is supposed to mean is: &quot;how much sugar am I adding to my diet if I purchase this honey or other natural sugar-containing product?&quot; Why is the FDA choosing to adopt this weird interpretation of what should be plain language? If I buy a jar of natural honey, that no one has added corn syrup to, it contains sugar; no sugar has been added to it. Please change this rule, FDA! The &quot;added sugars&quot; label should only apply to products where sugar is actually added, by the manufacturer or producer, to the already-existing product. I depend on you to make my life as a consumer easier, not more difficult. Thank you. <br/> ",

The organic sector applauds AMSs work on the proposed rule, appreciates the challenges that come with designing a check-off program for an entire multi-commodity sector, andlooks forward to a final rule andindustryvote so we can move forwardtoward creation of an organic check-off in an expedient manner.<br/><br/>The check-off model provides a tried and true vehicle for the organic sector to invest our own dollars in our collective continued growth  at no cost to the taxpayer. An organic check-off program would generate money for the organic sector to educate consumers about what organic is and its benefits; distinguish organic from other claims; undertake research to solve problems like invasive pests and weed control; bring new farmers into organic through information and technical assistance; and reduce the supply crunch by transitioning farmland to organic production. Moreover, the creation of an organic check-off would enable the organic sector to access public dollars that are only available to those who generate matching funds  a significant resource that as of yet the organic sector has been unable to access.<br/><br/>The proposed rule is very reform-minded and unlike any other check-off that has preceded it.This proposal resolves what has not worked in other check-offs and emphasizes what works  representing the diversity and creative thinking that has always been a hallmark of the organic sector.<br/><br/>Organic operations like mine want to use the check-off mechanism to help ourselves respond to research, education, promotion, and information challenges. The time is right for this  and were excitedto move toward a final rule andindustryvoteand acting collectively to ensure a strong future.<br/><br/>I thank the Agricultural Marketing Service for the opportunity tocomment, andI urgeUSDA to move to anindustryvote as soon as possible.",

It is estimated that indoor tanning causes upwards of 400,000 cases of skin cancer in the U.S. each year.  In fact, using indoor tanning beds before age 35 can increase your risk of melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer - by 59% and the risk increases with each use. <br/><br/>I also support the FDA&#39;s proposed risk acknowledgement form that adults would have to sign before using tanning beds and booths.  Quite a bit of misinformation exists on indoor tanning and some people think they are safe and beneficial.  The FDA&#39;s efforts will help correct this misinformation and educate adults about the risks associated with indoor tanning. <br/><br/>Restricting teens&#39; access to indoor tanning and educating all users about the dangers of tanning devices are critical steps to preventing skin cancer.  Together with the FDA&#39;s final rule reclassifying sunlamp products and the proposed rule updating sunlamp performance standards, this proposed rule will make a significant impact in reducing the incidence of skin cancer in the U.S.  I urge the FDA to finalize this proposed rule.",

    "text": "RE: Docket No. FDA-2015-N-1765] General and Plastic Surgery Devices: Restricted Sale, Distribution, and Use of Sunlamp Products<br/><br/>I am the Executive Director and founder of Childrens Melanoma Prevention Foundation (CMPF).  It is a non-profit educational foundation, established in 2003, to teach children and their caretakers safe and proven methods of sun protection and skin cancer prevention. Our aim is to reduce the incidence and impact of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, on families and society.  Each year, CMPF reaches over 100,000 children locally and thousands of health professionals nationally with our SunAWARE message.  CMPF partnered with other stakeholders to successfully advocate for an indoor tanning ban for minors in Massachusetts this year. <br/><br/>As an oncology and dermatology nurse, I have been extremely concerned about children exposing themselves to concentrated doses of UV radiation, a proven human carcinogen, to achieve skin darkening for cosmetic reasons.  I recently published an article entitled, Skin Cancer a Growing Health Problem for Children.    In this review article, I examined the National Cancer Institutes Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and found that melanoma was not only on the rise but was actually the 4th most common cancer in children.  Most importantly, I found that 72% of pediatric melanoma cases occurred in the girls between the ages of 15 to 19 years old.  Most people think that pediatric cancers develop due to a genetic predisposition or inherent risk factors.  However, this distribution of melanoma cases in young girls clearly indicates that risk for this population is acquired rather than inherited. A history of indoor tanning is a known acquired risk factor for melanoma and children must be protected from this harmful practice. <br/><br/>A recent study published by Lazovich et al found that younger women who had tanned indoors experienced a 2.3- to 6-fold increased likelihood of developing melanoma. This correlation between tanning and melanoma was particularly evident among women diagnosed with melanoma in their 20s.    Our foundation is very concerned about these case controlled studies but also concerned by anecdotal stories that we hear in the <br/>classroom.  Some students report indoor tanning more that once a day and many students report using no eye protection.  One 16-year-old girl said that she had opened her eyes in the tanning bed to see what I was not supposed to see.  Another teenage boy told us that he was severely burned when the operator, his classmate, allowed him to extend his session in the super bed to twenty minutes. I believe that the only way to protect children from the hazards of indoor tanning is to issue a national ban.<br/><br/>This year, Massachusetts became the 12th state to ban minors from indoor tanning.  Our ban will go into effect just in time for prom season on May 5, 2016.  In addition,  it will be difficult for most children in Massachusetts to indoor tan before the prom because our surrounding states also have restrictions. We need a nationwide ban to protect all children from this proven human carcinogen and to reduce their risk for developing skin cancer. Every child and adolescent in the U.S., regardless of the state in which he or she resides, deserves to be protected from UV radiation from sunlamps.  We believe that state-by-state efforts may be inadequate and CMPF fully supports the FDAs efforts to protect all Americans with this proposed rule restricting indoor tanning for minors. <br/><br/>We commend the FDA for issuing a proposed rule to restrict the use of indoor tanning equipment for minors. We believe that this proposed rule is a critical step in promoting the Surgeon Generals fourth goal in his 2014 Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer.  This goal to reduce harm caused by indoor tanning is one step in preventing skin cancer in America.  We strongly urge the FDA to finalize the proposed rule and protect all children in America from the harmful effects of indoor tanning.<br/><br/>",

See following as I fear and agree that to label honey sugars with the terminology &quot;added sugar&quot; will be detrimental to honey sales:<br/><br/>We recognize that honey is a source of sugar added to foods; however, there is nothing added to pure honey itself.<br/>Listing the sugar content in honey as &quot;Added Sugars&quot; on the nutrition facts label implies adulteration of honey in its natural form.  <br/>As stated in 21 US Code 342 (b)(4), &quot;A food shall be deemed to be adulterated... if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to...make it appear better or of greater value than it is.&quot;  <br/>If consumers are informed through the Nutrition Facts label that honey contains &quot;Added Sugars&quot; then consumers may be led to believe that honey is adulterated, by the regulatory definition, with sugars added to develop or enhance its sweetness. <br/>Consumers will be misled to believe that honey is sweetened by adding an external sugar source rather than the naturally occurring sugars inherent in honey.<br/>There is a risk of consumer confusion if the nutrition facts label notes &quot;Added Sugars&quot; but a separate area on the label notes &quot;naturally occurring sugar.&quot; By definition, something added cannot also be naturally occurring.  Our research shows that this will cause consumer confusion that hinders their ability to make informed food choices.<br/>We realize that honey is added to foods in preparation or manufacturing and in that case it is clearly an added sugar in those foods and would therefore be labeled as &quot;Added Sugars&quot; on the Nutrition Facts label.  However, pure honey, itself, does not contain added sugars.<br/>We share the desire for clear, understandable nutrition information to aid consumer choice.<br/>Our desire, as is the FDA&#39;s, is to inform consumer food choices to promote public health without confusion or misbranding around pure honey <br/>To that end, we are asking that the FDA consider listing the naturally occurring sugar content of 100% pure honey as a &quot;Total Sugar&quot; and not &quot;Added Sugars.&quot; ",

Why wouldn&#39;t we want that sort of doubling of an national economic benefit? Or go with Medicare for all? I thought national economics was Trump&#39;s uniting theme? You can always make additional private health insurance optional to those who want to pay for it. But look out for all of us, active, retired, disabled, etc. not just those lucking enough to have a job that pays for benefits. And seriously, the rich do not need one more set of tax cuts nor do insurance CEO&#39;s need their own special tax cut bribe. Eisenhauer pointed out that only when the rich are taxed to a significant degree, and the wealth run through programs benefiting the lower classes, do they actually make new investments in domestic production, pay living wages, and grow America in a way that lifts us all. Even Reagan&#39;s tax cuts didn&#39;t take the richest levels under 50%. With the only the rich getting the majority of benefits of economic boom, it&#39;s clear a real change is needed. Health care is just one leg of a 3 legged stool to restore the true possibility of security and prosperity to the lower and middle classes. Restoring pension programs is another key leg. Raising minimum wage is the 3rd leg. Or go do what your ---- masters have dictated to you and betray 350,000,000 real Americans.

    "text": "Docket No. FDA-2015-N-1765<br/>As an employee in the indoor tanning industry, I strongly oppose the FDAs proposal to ban tanning by minors and to require customers to sign a risk acknowledgement form every six months. Our customers enjoy tanning for a variety of reasons, and for the reasons outlined below, no further government regulation is needed.<br/>First, the decision of whether a minor should tan, be that outdoors in the sun or indoors at a tanning salon (that enforces limited tan times and other safety precautions), is best left to parents, not the federal government. Most states already require parental consent for minors to tan indoors, ensuring the parent has input and approval.<br/>In addition, we have many teenage clients who are referred to indoor tanning by their doctor or dermatologist to treat skin conditions. Why should these clients be required to obtain these services at a dermatology office which is much more expensive than at an indoor tanning salon? <br/>If minors are prohibited from using indoor tanning salons, they will instead use sunbeds at home, in an unregulated and unsupervised environment, and likely tan more aggressively outdoors. These alternatives would lead to an increase in sunburn and injury, compared to tanning at our salons which enforce tan time limits and other safety precautions.<br/>Next, requiring adults to sign a risk acknowledgement certification every six months in order to use a sunbed is absurd. Our customers are already required to acknowledge risk before their first session; requiring this to be done every six months would be an administrative nightmare and tremendous burden to our salon employees, without serving any valid public purpose. There is no other product or service in the country, including the purchase of alcohol, tobacco and red meat, that requires consumers to sign such a form. It would be unfair to require such a form in our business and not for the hundreds of products and services which present many more dangers than UV exposure.<br/>For all of these reasons, I am strongly opposed to these proposed additional regulations.<br/>",

I have read that adding the line, &quot;added sugars,&quot; to the labeling requirements is intended to differentiate between healthy and &quot;empty&quot; calories, and I agree that this is a good thing to communicate. If this was the differentiation that I as a consumer would see, I would be 100% for it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the label information, as currently written, does not communicate this. It communicates to the consumer that the beekeeping and honey industry is adding sugars to our honey, when in fact it is a pure and whole food that has not been altered in any way. As there have been numerous accounts recently of adulterated honey entering the US market, and selling adulterated honey is illegal, forcing beekeepers to say that they have added sugars to their honey (making it adulterated), when they have not, will be bad for both consumers and beekeepers. The end result will be further confusion from the nutrition label, rather than clarification.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.",

The organic sector applauds AMSs work on the proposed rule, appreciates the challenges that come with designing a check-off program for an entire multi-commodity sector, andlooks forward to a final rule andindustryvote so we can move forwardtoward creation of an organic check-off in an expedient manner.<br/><br/>The check-off model provides a tried and true vehicle for the organic sector to invest our own dollars in our collective continued growth  at no cost to the taxpayer. An organic check-off program would generate money for the organic sector to educate consumers about what organic is and its benefits; distinguish organic from other claims; undertake research to solve problems like invasive pests and weed control; bring new farmers into organic through information and technical assistance; and reduce the supply crunch by transitioning farmland to organic production. Moreover, the creation of an organic check-off would enable the organic sector to access public dollars that are only available to those who generate matching funds  a significant resource that as of yet the organic sector has been unable to access.<br/><br/>The proposed rule is very reform-minded and unlike any other check-off that has preceded it.This proposal resolves what has not worked in other check-offs and emphasizes what works  representing the diversity and creative thinking that has always been a hallmark of the organic sector.<br/><br/>Organic operations like mine want to use the check-off mechanism to help ourselves respond to research, education, promotion, and information challenges. The time is right for this  and were excitedto move toward a final rule andindustryvoteand acting collectively to ensure a strong future.<br/><br/>I thank the Agricultural Marketing Service for the opportunity tocomment, andI urgeUSDA to move to anindustryvote as soon as possible.",

    "text": "Based on my understanding of the updated rule I read I was very disappointed to see the rules for coordination of care with other health care providers, the sharing information in provision of integrated care and sharing information with health information exchanges was not streamlined - the regulations not reduced or changed for ease in these areas.  We continue to need specific permission from the patient to share this very critical medical information.  Withholding the information from coordination, from health information exchanges, and from the integrated care model causes care for the individual to be compromised.  The rules, from my perspective (someone who has worked with organizations servicing patients for over 30 years) continues to stigmatize the illness of addiction and continues to stigmatize addiction treatment.  Please consider eliminating the rules that require  authorization form the patient to share their treatment information with the providers who are providing treatment and care for the individual - we are providing treatment for the whole individual, not the individual minus the addiction.  This sort of restriction of information sometimes puts the patient at risk, they (the patient) choose not to share their addiction information so their providers or other aspects of their care are not aware of the treatment for addiction or their addiction and are then unable to include that variable in the treatment plan, sometime resulting in contra indicated treatments for the patient.",

    "text": "I concur with the proposed definition of dietary fiber and having it be labeled as fiber intact, isolated, and having beneficial health outcomes with them. I believe this will draw consumers to intake more dietary fiber, which is needed because the general population only intakes about half of the recommended amount of dietary fiber. Furthermore, I concur with mandating added sugars on the label. This is also important for the general population to see how many added sugars they intake. The general population intakes more than the recommended 10% of daily calories for sugars. Having added sugar on the label may also suggest to consumers that sugar naturally in the food is better than having added sugars. In this way, I think the general population may see how processed foods have a lot of added sugars like table sugar (by seeing how many grams)and intake less added sugars. However, I think there should be a percent of DRV implemented into the nutrition panel since the FDA recommends no more than 10% of daily calories from sugar. This would be a benefit to the general population for health. Lastly, the added sugar should only be zero if there is less than 0.5 gram of added sugars instead of only less than one gram.",

The reason is one often does not know the person who is sitting next to them and so 1) confidential information could be released by the person on the phone subjecting them to identify theft or blackmail and 2) the party not on the phone has no where to escape and thus the personal space is being violated. The sanctity of the small aircraft space should be upheld. When the plane is on the ground that is fine for using the phones. Passengers who want to rest, read, relax will be held hostage to those who want to talk, possibly not even realizing if their voice is loud. This can cause uncivil interactions with other patrons and put undue stress upon the flight crew as well. Just as smoking was once allowed and is now banned, using mobile wireless devices should continue in the same vein for the health and well-being of all people aboard the plane. Thank you.",

Reg. 8,004 (Jan. 23, 2017)<br/><br/>Reducing cancer-producing NNN is the easiest thing I have ever done; Ive done it thousands of times.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Paraphrasing Mark Twain<br/><br/>We already have the prolonged federally unauthorized experimental paradigm and exegesis of light cigarettes, which clearly and convincingly testify to the fact that less nicotine in cigarettes translates into a higher risk for developing nicotine dependence and cancer. Light cigarettes are more zealously drawn upon, more deeply inhaled, retained in the lungs longer, and more often smoked down to the filter; in addition, more light cigarettes are smoked to achieve a comparable but temporary nicotine-induced focused, calm, and wellbeing cognitive result when compared to regular cigarettes, with the corresponding tobacco companies substantially increasing their revenue accordingly. It took a publication like The Clinical Management of Nicotine Dependence (1991) to serve as the legal substrate to the litany of lawsuits that followed.<br/><br/>Similarly, limiting NNN (N-nitrosonornicotine) in smokeless tobacco products is highly likely to further increase the incidence of nicotine dependence and cancer, while rallying the sales of light smokeless tobacco, thereby making smokeless tobacco product manufactures an even greater fortune. <br/><br/>It is just a matter of time before some addiction or healthy lifestyle guru publishes a comprehensive textbook on the clinical management of smokeless tobacco products (or the equivalent), and the smokeless tobacco product companies will not have the very deep pockets and the compellingly vast international following that helped tobacco companies survive and prosper. <br/><br/>The FDA might consider scrapping this NNN Docket to sculpt a newer one to include but not be limited to: 1) warning labels on all smokeless tobacco products; 2) new quit smokeless tobacco public service announcements and ads, channeled into the already existing quit smoking infrastructure; 3) mandatory health insurance, life insurance, Social Security, and disability urine NNN screens, with corresponding premium hikes or benefit depletions based on positive NNN results; 4) 30% food stamp (SNAP) allocations toward fresh fruit and 30% toward fresh vegetables to help prevent cancer born of systemic oxidative stress caused by NNN; and 5) suggestions to smokeless tobacco product manufacturers that they tool up for an alternative product production, such as beginning to annex themselves with pharmaceutical companies to help develop new inhaler delivery systems for certain established pharmaceutical products.<br/><br/>The money state and federal governments might lose from taxes of smokeless tobacco products and industries may be gained from pertinently stepping up insurance premiums, stepping down benefits, shortening hospital and long-term care stays, and prolonging productivity and spending.<br/><br/>This Docket should be scrapped in its entirety and resubmitted in a form that benefits all sides of the trade.<br/><br/>If you require additional information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me by email.<br/><br/>Respectfully submitted,<br/>James A.
