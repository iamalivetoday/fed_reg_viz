The proposal generally would require that, before making a covered loan, a lender must reasonably determine that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal also would impose certain restrictions on making covered loans when a consumer has or recently had certain an outstanding covered loan.

The proposal also would identify it as an unfair and abusive practice to attempt to withdraw payment from a consumer\u2019s account for a\ncovered loan after two consecutive payment attempts have failed. The proposal would require lenders to provide certain notices to the consumer before attempting to withdraw payment for a\ncovered loan from the consumer\u2019s account.

    "text": "After reading your new rules on payday loans, I hope you do not go through with them.  These loans have helped me in the past and are the best choice for me. I use my phone for work every day so if I couldn&#39;t pay my phone bill, I would not have any income.  Sometimes my bill is a little higher than I have budgeted for and I need a little help.  I know I can rely on a payday loan if I&#39;m strapped for cash so I can keep using my phone.<br/> <br/>I like to be able to use payday loans when I need one. A rule that would require me to wait a certain amount of time in between loans would greatly affect my ability to pay bills. It makes no sense to have this kind of rule for people that pay back their loans. If I had to wait for a loan, I&#39;d have nowhere else to turn.<br/> <br/>I hope you understand that these types of loans make a real difference.  You should keep them available for the many people that depend on them.<br/> <br/>",

This only help the big trucking companies ( they have a lot more trucks and can move loads at slower speeds ) this will more than likely put all small and independent companies out of business. Maybe this is the plan all along, let the little guy die and the big companies thrive.",

For example, &quot;Although the critical reason is an important part of the description of events leading up to the crash, it is not intended to be interpreted as the cause of the crash nor as the assignment of the fault to the driver, vehicle, or environment.&quot; Singh, S. (2015, February). Critical reasons for crashes investigated in the National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey. (Traffic Safety Facts CrashStats. Report No. DOT HS 812 115). The question remains: why are drivers, fully licensed by the state as competent, put in situations in which they can make fatal errors?<br/><br/>Furthermore, studies by the RAND corporation have concluded that HAVs &quot;would have to be driven hundreds of millions of miles and sometimes hundreds of billions of miles to demonstrate their reliability in terms of fatalities and injuries.&quot; (Driving to Safety, http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1478.html , accessed Nov. 8, 2016) The authors of this particular study suggest that a test fleet of 100 cars driving 24 hours a day would have to drive for 400 to 500 years to draw any conclusions. <br/><br/>Proven strategies, such as traffic calming and passive pedestrian protection, exist. Government should spend its time focusing on a Vision Zero that works. <br/><br/>Tools and Resources<br/>Neither the Department of Transportation, state agencies, or local governments have been given the resources to develop and deploy the kinds of Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-infrastructure systems necessary to realize the full benefits of these new machines. As planned in 1991, and executed as a demonstration project in 1997, an integrated, government-led system of technological infrastructure was on the path to success. Unfortunately, the corporate interests involved - insurance companies, auto companies - spent most of their time worrying about costs and especially torts. So, the money for research and development eventually dried up.<br/> <br/>Corporate Leads the Way<br/>Today, corporations pushing HAVs are so much better capitalized then the agencies supposed to support them that the system will not be optimal. Put simply, if the government cannot afford to paint the lines on the road, HAVs will have trouble staying in their lanes. Also, corporations have fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders and need the support of capital markets. They are therefore opting for proprietary software. Distributed, open-source software has proven to be more transparent and robust. The government built ARPANET and later the Internet. DARPA funded major research into autonomy.<br/><br/>The American people built the Interstate Highway System because they believed it would improve commerce and safety. It would lead to a better life. That spirit should guide the federal government&#39;s stance on HAVs, V2V, and V2I development.<br/><br/>About me<br/>I have been studying and writing about roads, cars, and auto safety for more than 30 years. My work has appeared online, in the popular press, and academic journals.

I have noticed little to no side effects when taking kratom, only decreased pain and anxiety, and a better overall mood and outlook on life. I also have noticed no withdrawals when use is not needed.

    "text": "Docket No. FDA-1998-N0880<br/><br/>Sunlamp Products: Proposed Amendment to Performance Standard<br/><br/>As the owner of a professional tanning facility, I am submitting these comments in conjunction with material provided by the American Suntanning Association. I am concerned that, based on my experience, many of these proposals as written will not reduce sunburn incidence nor optimize exposure levels for my clients. Specifically:<br/><br/>FDA 21CFR 1040.20(d)(1)(iv) introduces an entirely new approach for a Manufacturer-Recommended Exposure Schedule. I have several concerns with this:<br/><br/>(1) FDA&#39;s proposed &quot;Manufacturer-Recommended Exposure Schedule&quot; needs revision. This system is supposed to provide a recommend framework leading to an absolute maximum time (the Maximum Timer Interval) to incrementally expose a tanner gradually. I could not in good faith recommend the series of intervals FDA proposes to my clients, which call for 3-4 minute increases from one session to the next - larger incremental increases than what I would ever routinely allow a client and for which FDA has no data in an actual salon tanning unit.<br/><br/>(2) Eliminating skin types from the schedule is a mistake. FDA asserts, &quot;Skin Type III and IV can attain a tan with UV doses that are similar to what is needed for Skin Type II&quot; based on a small study done with non-salon equipment in FDA&#39;s lab (Miller et al, 2012). While FDA&#39;s effort appears to be in good faith, based on my professional experience with thousands of tanning clients, FDA&#39;s conclusion is false. FDA did not even test Type IV tanners in its study. What&#39;s more, teaching clients their Fitzpatrick Skin Type is critical in my business to teach clients how to prevent sunburn both in the salon and outdoors. For clients with Skin Type II it may take several sessions before they see any results (which FDA expressed it wants clients to understand, per proposed 1040.20(5)(D)5). Taking this tool away will hurt my ability to teach Skin Type II sunbed clients how to prevent sunburn.<br/><br/>(3) Tanning courses and session frequency recommendations need revision. FDA&#39;s introduction of a &quot;tanning course&quot; (&quot;the period of time over which a tan is developed&quot; which FDA says is typically 3-4 weeks) and the suggestion that two sessions weekly should be a maximum fails to take into account why and how most indoor tanning clients visit salons and how professional salons teach and achieve sunburn prevention.<br/><br/>(a) A client who establishes a tan and then maintains it would not be engaging in a new &quot;course.&quot; Almost no client starts, stops and starts tanning as a &quot;course&quot; six times in a year. Most tan about three sessions a week for four weeks, and then maintain their tan with differing frequency based on their skin type.<br/><br/>(b) Limiting a client to two sessions weekly will result in clients visiting more than one salon to get 3-4 sessions weekly or simply purchasing home tanning units, which FDA knows are associated with greater sunburn risk, both of which would increase variables between exposures and increase sunburn. It will also lead to clients requesting longer exposure times to compensate for having fewer visits, which is counterproductive to teaching gradual exposure and sunburn prevention.<br/><br/>(c) Instead of recommending 48 hours between sessions on the label, I suggest this recommendation: &quot;Allow 24-48 hours between sessions to prevent sunburn.&quot; That gives the sunbed user and a salon operator the information they need to properly space sessions to prevent sunburn.<br/><br/>(d) Recommending a maximum of 48-50 sessions (15kJ) per year isn&#39;t warranted. There is no real metric for how you have established this. The government does not limit bacon or tobacco consumption for those who choose to consume those products - both of which present larger risks than sunbeds. I suggest the following: A statement on the exposure schedule that says, &quot;Limit Your Total Exposure. UV overexposure is linked to skin cancer.&quot;<br/><br/>(4) FDA should not require salons to recertify equipment currently in the marketplace to comply with the new Performance Standard. This would be more costly than FDA estimates and would likely shutter my business.<br/><br/>Without the changes I have suggested, the combined economic impact of FDA&#39;s proposals as written would not prevent sunburn nor reduce exposure, but would eliminate more than 40 percent of my salon&#39;s total revenue and would not educate clients in an effective fashion. Combined with FDA Rule FDA-2015-N01765, these rules would eliminate 47-50 percent of my salon&#39;s revenue - which would close my business.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Nicholas Goldamer",

    "text": "Docket No. FDA-2015-N-1765<br/><br/>As an employee at a professional suntanning salon, I would like to encourage FDA to work with the American Suntanning Association to revise its proposed regulations. These proposed rules will lead to an increase in sunburn and skin damage if implemented as written. The American Suntanning Association has requested, constructively, to work with FDA to fix these issues. Specifically:<br/><br/>- FDA-1998-N-0880 introduces an entirely new approach for sunbed exposure schedules. This new system eliminates the world standard skin typing system that we use to help prevent clients from overexposure. Further, I could not in good faith recommend the new series of intervals FDA proposes for my clients, which call for 3-4 minute increases from one session to the next - larger incremental increases than I would routinely allow many of my clients and for which FDA has no data in an actual salon tanning unit.<br/><br/>- FDA-1998-0880 arbitrarily limits my clients to 48 tanning sessions a year and just two sessions weekly. There is no science to support this blanket proposal. More importantly, there is no precedent for the federal government limiting consumer choice for any legal product - fast food hamburgers, bacon or even tobacco, all of which are on the World Health Organization&#39;s List of Carcinogens.<br/><br/>- FDA-2015-N-1765 would require my clients to sign a consent form every six months instead of simply once. Requiring this to be done every six months would be an administrative nightmare, without serving any valid public purpose. There is no other product or service in the country, including the purchase of alcohol, tobacco and red meat that requires consumers to sign such a form. It would be unfair to require this for our business and not for the hundreds of products and services that present many more dangers than UV exposure.<br/><br/>- FDA-2015-N-1765 also imposes a federal ban on UV tanning for those under age 18. If minors are prohibited from using indoor tanning salons, they will instead use sunbeds at home, in an unregulated and unsupervised environment, and likely tan more aggressively outdoors. These alternatives would lead to an increase in sunburn and injury, compared to tanning at our salons that enforce tan time limits and other safety precautions.<br/><br/>Please allow the American Suntanning Association and industry suppliers to work with you to improve your proposals.<br/><br/>",

Paying for my power bill can be a struggle sometimes, but it&#39;s a necessity that my family can&#39;t live without. I try to make sure I pay the bill on time so I don&#39;t have to pay more in late fees.  When I know my budget is going to come up short, I take out a payday loan to help me keep the lights on.<br/> <br/>The internet is a basic human right and I&#39;ve used a pay day loan in the past to pay my bill when it was too expensive.  I couldn&#39;t imagine what I would do without one of these loans to keep me connected to the internet.<br/> <br/>This new proposed rule that would limit me from getting a cash advance until I have waited a certain amount of time is terrible. I use cash advances for emergencies, and if I have an emergency during the waiting period, where am I going to turn for money? If this new rule goes into effect, I will have to get a loan from an international online lender, and I&#39;d rather just get a cash advance from someone I know.<br/> <br/>Thanks for reading what I have to say.  I am sure that there are many other people that feel the same as I do and I hope you change this rule.",

You never know what could happen in life.<br/> <br/>The government is always trying to create more red tape, especially for ordinary people like me who can&#39;t fight back.  These new cash advance rules are going to make applying for a loan harder and more difficult to qualify.  I am worried that I won&#39;t be able to use them anymore in the future and that could result in some bills being paid late.<br/> <br/>When I was going through a tough time, payday loans gave me a helping hand.

Cash advance loans helped me in my time of need, and I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to use them again.<br/> <br/>One of the best solutions to avoiding late utility fees is to be able to pay some bills with a pay day loan. I don&#39;t use it very often but I was glad I did when a problem came up that I wasn&#39;t expecting.  It comes in handy when a long hot summer or a brutal winter increases my power bill.

These services are easy to use and vital for people like me.<br/> <br/>There are months when my phone bill is very expensive. If that happens, I take out a cash advance to pay for it all because they are affordable and can be taken out quickly. It is so much better to use these loans rather than trying to wait for my next paycheck.<br/> <br/>I completely disagree with any new rule that will stop me taking out a payday loan whenever I need one. I think this will only make things harder when I need a loan and I don&#39;t need more to worry about.

When that happens, I get a cash advance to help me pay for everything without having to worry that much.<br/> <br/>I wish power bills didn&#39;t exist, but unfortunately they do, and if you don&#39;t pay them, you lose your power. To prevent that sometimes I take out a cash advance to pay the essential bills. Thanks to cash advance loans, I&#39;ve never had an issue.<br/> <br/>A cooling off period is a bad idea for people that depend on payday loans to make ends meet.  I hope the government does not make me wait to get loans like these because they are the best borrowing option for me. Without them, I would sometimes miss payments on important bills.<br/> <br/>I hope you rethink the proposal against these loans.  If the rule does not change, families like mine won&#39;t be able to get the help we desperately need.",

Cash loans are not bad, and people should be able to borrow money this way when they need to. My budget is very tight, and sometimes I find myself struggling to even get groceries at the supermarket. In the past, I have even used a short-term loan to help me get food on the table, and I&#39;ve found this service to be amazingly helpful as I plan out my monthly budgets.<br/> <br/>All it takes is a few late bills to negatively impact your credit score. To keep that from happening I get pay-day advances from time to time to ensure that I can get all of my bills paid on time. These loans are perfect for maintaining your credit score because they help you pay your bills on time.<br/> <br/>I do not agree with the new CFPB rules that put a limit on the number of days I can use a payday loan over an entire year. That makes no sense.  The government shouldn&#39;t be restricting my access to these loans as long as I pay back what I borrow.  If these loans weren&#39;t available, guess I would have to use a lender that doesn&#39;t operate with this kind of restrictions.<br/> <br/>Cash advances have worked for me, as well as many others, and I urge you to change your new rules on these loans before people like me are hurt.",

With ace they work with you no matter your sercomstances as long as we the people getting the loans keep in contact with them make our payments or if something comes up and you need a few more days to pay your loan communication is the key be honest with the loan company and they work with us. People like me with a bad credit score i cant get loans from real banks or credit unions. And people like me usually have family thats in the same position and cant ask each other for a loan even from family. Please dont take these type of places away we need more like them.<br/><br/>When i was young i did everything wrong when it came to bills not realizing that as i would mature into a woman and have a kid of my own that it would all come back to hurt me in the long run. I feel as though they should start teaching the school kids about things like this. It is hard for a person like me that grew up with nothing to hold on to our money and do the right thing such as pay bills or save money or even how to manage a check book. If places such as ace check cashing stop business i dont know what i will do. Please please keep these places in business they offer a variety of different things thst they do from cashing a check to paying a bill from a loan to insurance.  I believe these types of business are made for us lower class people.",

    "docAbstract": "Pursuant to sections 1031 and 1032 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) (Dodd-Frank Act), the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is proposing to establish 12 CFR part 1041, which would contain regulations creating consumer protections for certain consumer credit products. The proposal generally would cover two categories of loans. First, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term of 45 days or less or loans with multiple advances if each advance is required to be repaid within 45 days. Second, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term greater than 45 days, provided that they (1) have an all-in annual percentage rate greater than 36 percent; and (2) either are repaid directly from the consumer\u2019s account or income or are secured by the consumer\u2019s vehicle. For both categories of covered loans, the proposal would identify it as an abusive and unfair practice for a lender to make a covered loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal generally would require that, before making a covered loan, a lender must reasonably determine that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal also would impose certain restrictions on making covered loans when a consumer has or recently had certain an outstanding covered loan. The proposal would provide lenders with options to make covered loans without satisfying the ability-to-repay requirements, if those loans meet certain conditions. The proposal also would identify it as an unfair and abusive practice to attempt to withdraw payment from a consumer\u2019s account for a\ncovered loan after two consecutive payment attempts have failed. The proposal would require lenders to provide certain notices to the consumer before attempting to withdraw payment for a\ncovered loan from the consumer\u2019s account. The Bureau is also proposing to adopt official interpretations to the proposed regulation."
