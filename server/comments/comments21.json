The authors describe the essential role P5P plays in the body: &quot;[P5P] is required for the function of over 300 enzymes and proteins. Virtually every major system of the body is impacted directly or indirectly by [it].&quot;<br/><br/>Vitamin B6 is essential to human life, but not only is the FDA approving drugs that deplete our body of this nutrient--the agency is allowing pharmaceutical companies to hijack different forms of vitamin B6 and turn them into drugs. In 2009 the FDA banned the supplement form of pyridoxamine in response to a petition from a drug company, which wanted to use it in a drug formulation.<br/><br/>P5P faces a similar threat. The FDA is considering a petition from Medicure Pharma to ban P5P because the company wants to turn this crucial vitamin into a drug. This is especially scaryall forms of B6, natural or synthetic, must be converted to P5P for the body to use them. If the FDA approves the petition, anyone who is not able to convert synthetic B6 to P5P would have to rely solely on Medicure&#39;s product to stay alive.<br/><br/>Please preserve access to affordable vitamin B6 supplements, and consider revoking approval for carbidopa for its dangerous side effects.<br/>",

The Approval process provides for perpetual use as well as care and maintenance of the land for the benefit of the listed species as well as a multitude of other native species.  <br/><br/>Utilizing Habitat Conservation Banks reduces the amount of time, energy and effort required of Service personnel by providing a market based habitat mitigation opportunity that already is approved.  Thus reducing the requirement for Service Personnel to evaluate proposed mitigation options for each and every project under review.  Further, Conservation Banks Management Plans provide for mandatory and professional review and reporting, thus insuring the highest quality of long term habitat mitigation at no cost to the Service, or the American Public at large.<br/><br/>Additionally, Conservation Banks provide the opportunity for good paying jobs in our mostly rural areas and provide financial support to existing, mostly small or local businesses, thru purchase of goods and services to support the banks.<br/><br/>Again, thank you for the opportunity to comment.

    "text": "This submission is a stakeholder comment to your &quot;Development of a List of Pre-DSHEA Dietary Ingredients&quot; issue. My name is Richard Rose and I&#39;m an award-winning food industry professional of 37 years now retired, and also a well-known commercial producer of numerous Hempseed foods starting in 1994, months before DSHEA. Here I am representing the Hemp Food Association, which I founded in 1998.<br/><br/>While DSHEA 1994 is only 23 years old, it is a well-documented fact that humans and animals have consumed Hemp Flower Products for many millennia around the world, including the USA where Hemp has been grown continuously since at least 1606. This is because the resin adhering to the flowers as well as fine particles of flower are inevitably consumed when the seed is eaten or pressed for its edible oil. This sticky resinous adherent on the outside of the shell of the hempseed is difficult to remove, even today, and often include Hemp Flower fines. With at least 12,000 years of safe continuous use around the world, FDA must consider Hemp Flower Products, in their natural form, as an existing ingredient for the purposes of DSHEA, and not as a New Dietary Ingredient any more than water, heirloom apples, or ancient rye varieties. This is the case for not only compounds found in the resin such as Cannabidiol (CBD) or Terpenes, but also for the other Hemp Flower Products, namely whole or shelled* hempseed, hempseed oil, hempseed oil presscake, hempseed sprouts, or hemp flower as a human or animal food, or dietary supplement. <br/><br/>It is in that context I make this submission.<br/><br/>Hemp (genus &quot;Cannabis,&quot; also known for centuries as &quot;Hemp&quot;) is considered by many historians to be one of mankind&#39;s oldest cultivated crops. The use of the seed for food is many millennia older than even use of soybean for food. Hemp has been used in human cultures since prehistoric times, at least since the end of the Pleistocene era. From Africa to China and Japan to Scandinavia to Eastern and Southern Europe to the Americas, Hempseed has been an essential commodity to eat, grow, and trade. High in essential amino (23%, edestin and albumin types) and fatty (25%, including omega-3 and GLA) acids, vitamins and minerals, and fiber (35%) it was highly versatile and could be eaten, fed to animals, converted to oil for eating or lamps, or planted as a seed or fiber crop years later. Even the protein type is called &quot;edestin,&quot; from the Greek edestos meaning &quot;to eat.&quot;<br/><br/>In the US, Hemp enjoys a legal exemption from the Controlled Substances Act (stalk and nonviable seed), protections for viable seed, flower and cultivation in Section 7606 of the 2014 Farm Bill, and protections afforded by the Ninth Circuit Court in 2004 as to incidental THC remaining in the product, even enough to trigger a Driving Under the Influence charge in some states.<br/><br/>Since the seed is in the flowering tops of the female, the outside of the calyx surrounding the seed comes into direct physical contact with the resin next to it, then the resin on the calyx touches the perianth of the seed, to which it adheres, along with small particles of flower. Even with modern cleaning methods removing that resin from Hempseed is difficult if not impossible, one study shows as high as 50 parts-per-million THC remaining in common health food store hempseed oil from Canada. So difficult in fact, that the Hempseed oil industry won a suit in 2004 to be allowed to leave any amount of THC undisclosed in their oil, due to this sticky resin.<br/><br/>Hemp has long been one of mankind&#39;s most popular plants, and our evolution is intertwined with that of it. Since humans have been eating hempseed for at least 12,000 years, we have also been consuming small amounts of Hemp resin and flower all that time. Hempseeds function as a nutritious food and source of vegetable oil is significant, and its ability to hold that nutritional value for years was prized. Discovering its fibrous properties was most likely a byproduct of seed collection for food. The most-predominant Cannabinoid in Hemp resin by far is Cannabidiol (CBD). Therefore, as a species we&#39;ve been consuming CBD and Hemp flower for millennia, as have been our animals.<br/><br/>Although FDA may want proof of domestic commercial activity for Hemp Flower Products prior to 1994, for such a common food it is as ridiculous as using such criteria for other ancient ingredients as water, olive oil, or millet. The relatively short window for product introduction you allow for consideration is a tiny fraction of the time Hempseed has been a food, far pre-dating written record. <br/><br/>Hemp has been called one of the oldest known cultivated crops. The use of Hemp most likely predates the dawn of agriculture. Ancient Chinese texts and archeological evidence suggest that Hempseed use for food in China reaches back into the early Neolithic period and perhaps to the late Paleolithic. <br/><br/>Please see the attached PDF for the rest of my Comments and Attachments. Thank you.<br/>",

America has tremendous resources and developing these resources is the key to turning America around. America has 26% of the world&#39;s recoverable conventional oil resources, and that doesn&#39;t begin to include our enormous oil shale, tight oil and heavy oil resources. We also hold almost 30% of the world&#39;s technically recoverable conventional natural gas resources. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has also found that America possesses largest oil, natural gas, and coal resources on earth - more than Saudi Arabia, China, and Canada combined. the economic benefits from domestic oil and gas development, due to hydraulic fracturing it will save American families million. Just one look at the states that are developing their own resources and its clear which plan works: Oklahoma has over 83,000 producing oil wells and 43,000 producing natural gas wells. The Oklahoma oil and gas industry supports 300,000 jobs and contributes $51 billion to the state economy every year. That is precisely why Oklahoma&#39;s unemployment rate is has been consistently around 4 percent .. Taking advantage of our resources, and rolling back Obama and his EPA&#39;s policies of energy austerity, will lead to immense economic rewards , millions of new jobs, and increased energy security. How successful America is in achieving economic recovery has much to do with how successful roll back job-killing, anti-fossil fuel regulations agenda the Obama administration had set for America.<br/> the National Academy of Sciences study concluded that reducing greenhouse gas emissions through tax preferences was costly to American tax payers . ..( controlling earth climate is for God not our leaders or donors pretense ), Moreover, it found that some preferences can have the unintended effect of increasing greenhouse gas emissions. The National Academy of Sciences study assessed the effectiveness of tax credits in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, included a review of the existing literature as well as original analysis based on the authors&#39; own model. the NAS study examined the effects of tax credits for renewable transportation fuels. In that case, it found that the credits actually increased greenhouse gas emissions. It attributed that counterintuitive result to the fact that the tax credits for renewable fuels reduced the price and thus increased the consumption of motor fuels. That increase in turn outweighed any beneficial emission effects . ",

    "text": "Dear Secretary Chao:<br/>Our company is a custom finisher &amp; motor carrier in the entertainer<br/>motorcoach market since we began business in 2002. We operate a fleet of 40 coaches with approximately 75 employees (mix of part-time and full).<br/><br/>In particular, our company wishes to address the new requirement for seat belts on entertainer<br/>motorcoaches manufactured on or after November 28, 2017. 78 Fed. Reg. 70415 (November 25,<br/>2013).<br/>Entertainer motorcoaches are a unique form of transportation specifically designed and<br/>manufactured for small groups such as music bands or political candidates. Although<br/>constructed on the same bus chassis or platform as a 55-passenger motorcoach, entertainer<br/>coaches generally are customized in two or more stages from an &quot;incomplete vehicle&quot; and<br/>finished to seat fewer than 16 persons, while providing the amenities more closely associated<br/>with a &quot;motor home.&quot; Amenities in entertainer motorcoaches typically include couch seating,<br/>galleys, tables, showers, bunk beds, satellite television, a cooking area with counter tops, and<br/>refrigeration units.<br/>These vehicles, which typically include side-facing, perimeter seating are custom built, rather<br/>than mass produced. Fewer than 100 entertainer motorcoaches are manufactured each year. The<br/>3-point seatbelts required to be installed in all new second stage vehicles manufactured after<br/>November 28, 2017 have never been tested for use in sideways-facing seats. The belts and their<br/>anchorages were only tested for use in forward-facing seats. As a result, we are concerned that<br/>serious injury to passengers could result from the good faith efforts made by operators and<br/>manufacturers to comply with this rule.<br/><br/>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never intended for the seatbelt requirement<br/>to apply to entertainer coaches. Its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 75 Fed. Reg. 50958 (August<br/>18, 2010), proposed to apply the seat belt requirements to a motorcoach defined as a vehicle<br/>having at least two rows of passenger seats, rearward of the driver&#39;s position, and forward facing<br/>(or can be converted to face forward without the use of tools). See 78 Fed. Reg. at 70427. This<br/>would have excluded entertainer coaches, which generally have seating positions around the<br/>perimeter of the vehicle.<br/><br/>On July 6, 2012, however, the President signed into law the Motorcoach Enhanced Safety Act,<br/>Title II, Subtitle G of MAP-21, Pub. L. No. 112-141. Section 32703 of MAP-21 provided, &quot;Not<br/>later than 1 year after the date of enactment, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring<br/>safety belts to be installed in motorcoaches at each designated seating position.&quot; Under the<br/>Motorcoach Enhanced Safety Act, &quot;motorcoach&quot; means an over-the- road bus, but does not<br/>include a bus used in public transportation provided by, or on behalf of, a public transportation<br/>agency, or a school bus. Because the statute extended the requirement for seat belts to all<br/>motorcoaches and at each designated seating position, the final rule dropped the definition of<br/>motorcoach and &quot;requires all designated seating positions on the over-the- road buses to have<br/>lap/shoulder belts regardless of the seating configuration of the bus or the vehicle GVWR.&quot; 78<br/>Fed. Reg. at 70420. There were no hearings, debate or consideration in Congress on the effect of<br/>this seat belt mandate on entertainer coaches.<br/><br/>There are two possible exceptions to this general requirement. First, the seat belt rule would not<br/>apply to perimeter seating buses that are not OTRBs if they have 7 or fewer forward-facing<br/>designated seating positions, not including the driver&#39;s seat. 78 Fed. Reg. at 70435. An OTRB<br/>is defined as &quot;a bus characterized by an elevated passenger deck located over a baggage<br/>compartment.&quot; 78 Fed. Reg. at 70417, n.4. NHTSA noted, &quot;To the extent that these niche<br/>vehicles are body-on- frame construction (not over-the- road buses) they could qualify to be<br/>exempted as perimeter-seating buses.&quot; 78 Fed. Reg. at 70434, n. 65.<br/>Second, the rule does not apply to vehicles with fewer than 10 overall designated seating<br/>positions, not including the driver&#39;s seat, as these vehicles do not meet the definition of a &quot;bus.&quot;<br/>78 Fed. Reg. at 70434, n.65; 49 CFR 571.3.<br/>Alternatives: (1) Exempt entertainer motorcoaches from this rule in a manner similar to school<br/>buses, transit buses and prison buses by creating a new definition under 49 CFR 571.3 that<br/>applies to 16 or more designated seating positions, including the driver. Motor homes are also<br/>currently exempt from the seat belt requirements, except for the driver and forward-facing<br/>passenger seating positions.<br/>(2) In addition, we ask DOT to grant a 90-day waiver of the November 28, 2017 application of<br/>the rule to allow entertainer motorcoach manufacturers, customizers and operators to petition for<br/>a revised definition of a &quot;bus&quot; for purposes of the seatbelt rule.<br/><br/>please see the attached PDF that has more room due to character count limitation! thank you!",

    "text": "As medical doctor and especially as pulmonary specialist I have huge experience with patients, with or without serious diseases, who cannot quit smoking in one of the country with the highest smoking rates - Bulgaria. For many years, me and my colleagues have initiated or participated in different anti-smoking campaigns and programs, in research projects with NRT, gave numerous interviews and talks about the harmful effects of smoking. Some of these activities were successful, others not so much, but at the end of the day there are still more than 2.5 million smokers in Bulgaria. When I heard about the first smoke free product of PMI I was skeptical, but I am a doctor and out of curiosity I started to read and get deeper in the scientific data about the product. I can say that the researches in pulmonary area are really interesting and I am waiting with even bigger interest for the further clinical trials data. I think that the development of high quality products that have the potential to reduce the risk for those who do not want to quit smoking is very promising. Such products should have solid data and evidence behind them and the evaluation of external agencies is critical in order the society and we, as medical doctors, to be sure that these products are real better alternative than smoking.

Smokers wanting to use it as an alternative to regular cigs with the hopes of living longer, reducing health risks and kicking nicotine addiction, it seems like a low nicotine stick (a real Marlboro Light with low tar and small or variable amounts of nicotine) could help advance the product and encourage people to move to healthier living. A side note - I found that the burn temperatures for IQOS have been inconsistent in publications I have researched especially compared to regular cigarettes. I hope the FDA is carefully reviewing that type of data to be sure it is accurate and straightforward since it relates directly to the various stages of combustion. Also I wouldn&#39;t want to switch to find that the Heat &quot;vapor&quot; is actually a clever substitution for the word smoke, based on an early phase of combustion - starts with a p. pyrolisis or something - like charring but not flames. I hope my comments are helpful. Thank you for initiating these reviews and rules to help addicts kick nicotine.",

    "text": "Comment for Federal motor carrier safety administration (FMCSA)<br/>Docket number DOT-OST-2017-0069<br/><br/>I would like the FMCSA to repeal the 14 hour clock regulation ( 49 CFR Part 395.3(2) <br/>As an owner operator for a small carrier hauling LTL shipments owner of a small dairy in upstate New York the 14 hour clock makes it virtually impossible to load and deliver these loads in one or sometimes even two days. This is unacceptable for a load that covers only 400 miles in many cases this 2 day unloading overlaps into a third day in order to pick up Backhaul.  The first issue arises when the shipper has limited appointment times for pick ups carriers are forced to take less desirable appointments many times. When hauling LTL shipments, customers generally order A small quantity of many items.  Due to that fact shippers will put together as many as seven or eight shipments to build a full load. The result is shippers then require extended loading times due to the volume of items needing to be picked to fill these orders. This process can take several hours and many shippers do not compensate the carrier for this lost time.<br/>Once the truck is finally loaded we face the next challenge. Customers/receivers do not all share the same receiving hours so may start at midnight and receive until 8 AM others may start at 8 PM and receive until 5 AM yet others may start at 3 PM and receive until 11 PM all different times for different customers. When trying to schedule deliveries to five places whom are all within a 100 mile radius of each other but have different hours you sometime spend for five or even six hours sitting waiting for your next appointment. The 14 hour rule/clock keeps kicking and before you know it your day has ended and you need to make deliveries the following day. I generally spend two days to deliver a load that could easily be delivered in one day if the 14 hour clock didn&#39;t prevent me from doing so. I&#39;m also forced at times to wait 24 hours to pick up a backhaul because of this 14 hour clock.<br/>I would suggest that we do away with a 14 hour continuous clock and allow drivers to spread out their work hours through the day as needed you could potential he require a certain length of sleeper berth before extending past the 14 hours this would allow drivers to make use of many hours wasted spent waiting around for deliveries or while getting loaded or unloaded. There&#39;s nothing worse then delivering at 5 AM, 6 AM and 11 AM And then waiting for your last stop at 6 PM to deliver and once you&#39;re done delivering at 6:30 or seven you have to take a minimum of eight hour break or a 10 hour break when you just spent six or seven hours sleeping or resting. It is my believe that the 14 hour rule is one of the worst rules ever implemented in our industry this rule forces drivers to drive knowing that they may be tired however if they don&#39;t arrive on time at their customers many of them will charge a late fee, i&#39;ve seen these fees as high as $500. The same shipper who will charge a carrier $500 for being late will hold a carrier who was on time at their dock for 5,6,7 sometimes even eight hours to get unloaded, this is absolutely unacceptable for the carrier and for the driver who many times does not get compensated for that time. <br/>I would also suggest that some type of service standards could be put into place for shippers and receivers for example maximum acceptable loading/unloading times. The shipping or receivers who were to exceed this rule would be required to pay the trucking company for their lost time and the loss of future loads. <br/>This regulation affects many carriers to haul LTL for their customers to keep small businesses driving in America. These small businesses rely on LTL shipments due to the fact that they cannot order for truckloads of product. LTL carrier such as the one I work for deliver to Foodservice companies who sell to these small businesses as well. In other words not only do the trucking company suffer, the small business owners both on the shipping and the receiving side suffer from this law. <br/>Thank you for taking the time to hear my difficulties with this burdensome regulation that myself and my fellow LTL truckers are dealing with. Please feel free to contact me if I may be of any assistance or provide any other insight to this matter. <br/><br/>Adam Safford <br/>A. L.

Certain species are unable to avoid direct impact due to their inherent poor mobility (e.g., Blanding&#39;s turtle, club shell mussel, and the brook floater and green floater). Bats are voracious predators of nocturnal insects, including many crop and forest pests.

The goal in the underlying statutes and executive branch guidance is not to &quot;minimize burdens;&quot; it is to maximize energy conservation, or minimize pollution, by adopting rules that maximize net benefits to the nation.  Overemphasizing costs and underemphasizing benefits distorts the analysis and undermines the ability of the responsible agencies to accomplish the goals of the statutes.  This distortion is not simply illegal, it is bad policy - robbing consumers and the economy of valuable resources and imposing unnecessary harm on the environment and public health<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Failing to adopt a standard whose benefits outweigh it costs because of the &quot;two-out, one-in&quot; rule (O.E. 13777, February 24, 2017) violates the underlying statutes.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Wasting public and private resources by favoring expensive production over lower cost conservation and efficiency (O.E. 13783, March 28, 2017) is both illegal and irrational. <br/>A freeze and roll back of current standards that have strong positive cost benefit ratios constitutes a direct contradiction of the statute and executive guidance (OMB Circular A-94).<br/>The administration&#39;s bias in favor of industry contradicts the underlying statutes and disturbs the &quot;objective&quot; balance the executive orders sought to achieve.  Because the underlying statutes and executive guidance are still in place, the challenge for the agencies will be to build hearing records that support a new direction.  Throughout this analysis we show that they are very unlikely to be able to make a convincing case.  We directly address the tired old industry arguments, which we are likely to be offered anew.  In a sense, these comments and much of the analysis in the Attachment can be read as rebuttal of those arguments.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The cost of compliance is invariably much less than anticipated, Section X on vehicles, Section XV on appliances, Section XVI on computers.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Cost is closely linked to the feasibility of standards, a topic explicitly addressed in several Sections, including all of Part VIII, covering current fuel economy standards, Section VIII addressing past fuel economy standards, Section XIII on heavy-duty trucks and Section XVI covering computers. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Consumer desires and abilities, frequently cited as evidence against standards are shown to be the opposite on both counts, they want more efficiency than the manufacturers admit (Sections VII and VIII), and have less ability to implement their desires than the manufacturers claim (Section IX) <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The claim that weakening standards helps low income households is shown to be incorrect on all three measures of the impact of standards in Section XIX, which reviews consumer pocketbook, public health, and macroeconomic stimulation.    <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Claims that standards slow the economy, reduce sales and cost jobs are shown to be false (Section XI and XIX). <br/>The comments directly address many of the key issues that are being raised in the broad attack on regulation across a number of agencies<br/><br/>From the consumer point of view, the comments show the following:<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The freeze and rollback of the key regulations identified in the notice would impose massive harm on consumers, the economy and public health - totally well over $1 trillion, with cost savings of less than $100 billion.  These losses violate the statute, which obliges the industry to deliver maximum feasible energy savings and, because they have a negative benefit cost ratio, they are contrary to OMB guidance. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The consumer stakes are not only huge, but low and middle-income households benefit disproportionately from efficiency standards, which means that weakening the standards is a hidden tax on households in the bottom half of the income distribution.<br/><br/>From a legal/technical point of view, the comments demonstrate the following two critical points that contradict the broad effort to gut standards: <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Independent technology assessments and the long history of declining costs for efficiency contradict the complaints from industry that the standards hurt them, which rebuts the primary rationale for freeze and rollback. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>There is an inseverable link between pollution reduction, consumer pocketbook savings and macro-economic growth, which means that complaints about agencies exceeding their authority by counting &quot;co-benefits&quot; are illogical and contradicted by the statutes.<br/>",

    "text": "In effort to make sense of a story with two distinct sides, I would like to interject my thoughts on this ongoing dilemma referred to as the &quot;Opioid Crisis&quot; facing America today. An extreme polar argument is rapidly formed demanding that - do we (society) as a whole allow the widespread prescribing of pain-relieving narcotics to continue or do we commit patients to be forcibly and untimely withdrawn off of such medications, and exactly who are making these decisions for us?<br/><br/>Either decision ends with hardship, struggle, and loss to either families who experience an untimely death due to young people and older who are over medicating themselves, or do we forcibly reduce and/or cut the supply to pain patients who more than likely may go off the deep end once they experience harsh or sudden withdrawal symptoms, or even worse who will then turn to illegal narcotics for comfort and alleviation of withdrawal effects.<br/><br/>Side note on the word &quot;comfort&quot; - on meds can be comforting, off meds not so comforting to say the least.<br/><br/>My suggestion is to take a slower approach to change such as this. All too often the Media coverage unleashed across America drives to solve a problem in its time frame, which we all know as 15 minutes. Calmer heads must prevail, and the doctors and patients should be the ones determining long-term patient goals. Pain patients are justifiably worried in ways that most people will not ever understand until it may specifically happen to them.  As a liver transplant patient who with end-stage liver disease I had extremely swollen ankles and legs; my doctor at the time was off work with a bout of gout, and he later iterated to me how he now understood the pain I was going through.<br/><br/>Currently, I am on a low dose of pain meds myself, and asked to wean off of them entirely which luckily I am in agreement with - but what if I was not, what would happen then?  <br/><br/>   ",

I broke my back in a ski accident 35 yrs ago. he told me when i get older, ill have issues. Not only have i acquired arthritis around the break, i have severe cervical stenosis degenerative disc desease and spondilytis, i also have cardio pulminary desease and stage 4 cirrohsis. The cirrohsis was not caused by anything i did except get a manicure from the wrong  I travelled the country selling footwear to dept stores big box stores etc. I carried 4/6 80 lb sample cases and travelled to an avg of 3 cities a week. <br/>After 9/11 i decided to change careers that was less physical. About two years into the job i noticed a pain in my neck. It was getting worse on a daily basis. The first xray has me rushed to a hospital. The worry was any hit to my neck could paralyze me.<br/>THIS IS WHEN THE NITEMARE STARTED. Physical therapy caused my initial break at the t4 vertebrae to worsen because of the stretching machine they used. It also caused excruciatimg pain in my neck. This pain put me on my 1st bout of disability. As the sole provider for my family of four this shattered my worth of self being. After a barrage of more epidurals injections and electro stimulationn, i finally gave into trying opioid therapy. <br/>My pain Dr started my with norcos and muscle relaxers. They were zero help.<br/>Every week i was in his office. I was very discouraged. He finally tried oxycontin and over time he worked me up to 3/80 mg a day and 3/30 mg of oxycodone for breakthru pain. I asked him WHY AM I NOT KNOCKED OUT. HE SAID HE TOOK A METABOLISM TEST AND I AM A SUPRE FAST METABOLIZER AND SINCE YOIR IN SO MUCH PAIN, THE MEDICINE IS NOT EFFECTING YOU LIKEIT WOYLD A DRUG ADDICT.<br/>TGIS DOSE WORKED FOR 7 YEARS. I WAS STILL IN A LITTLE PAIN BUT AT LEAST I WAS NOT BEDRIDDEN. IF I DID TOO MUCH ACTIVITY I REGRETTED IT. <br/>FAST FORWARD.. I MOVED TO HELP MY DAD WHO HAD CANCER, NEW JOB HAD KAISER. I GAVE THE NEW DR ALL OF MY RECORDS AND SHE CONTINUED THE REGIMEN FOR THREE YEARS.<br/>THEN IT HAPPENED THE CDC GUIDELINES CAME OUT AND SHE TOLD ME EVERY PATIENT IS BEING REDUCED.<br/>I TOLD HER ITS GOING TO PUT ME IN BED 24/7. I PLEADED WITH HER. I NEVER FAILED A URINE TEST I ALWAYS TOOK AS DIRECTED ETC. SHE SAID ITS OUT OF HER HANDS. I EROTE THE CEO AND I GET A LETTER SSAYING NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY. I SAID IT WAS MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR YEARS, MY NECK AND BACK DIDNT HEAL, IM A FAST METABOLIZER THIS IS GOING TO END UP BAD. NOBODY CARES! I AM AT 1/2 OR THE CDC GUIDELINES THE DOSAGE THAT WORKS. IT TAKES AWAY ABOUT 25/30% OF THE PAIN. IF I DO ANY ACTIVITY LIKE WALKING OR MAKING THE BED. O COULD START SCREAMING. MY WIFE SAYS WHEN I FINALLY DO FALL ASLEEP I AM MOANING ALL NIGHT. KASIER SAYS ITS BECAUSE THE MEDICINE DOESNT WORK. I CANT ARGUE OR THEYLL STOP TREATING ME. BUT ONCE OR TWICE A MONTH I TAKE MY OLD DOSE IN A DAY, JUST TO HAVE A DAY OR TWO THAT I CAN BE PRODUCTIVR AND BE PRETTY MUCH PAIN FREE. I DIDNT OVERDOSE OR DIE LIKE THEY SAID I WOULD. IVE NEVER GOTTEN HIGH BUT BECAUSE OF MY 2 DAYS OF PEACE I HAVE 2 DAYS OF MORE MISERY. I MUST MAKE IT LAST A MONTH. <br/>THIS PROVES, I NOR THE MILLIONS OF OTHERS THAT MAKE OUR MEDICINE LAST A MONTH ARE NOT ADDICTS!<br/>IF I WAS AN ADDICT I WOULD USE THE ENTIRE PRESCRIPTION IN A WEEK. THEN I WOULD ALSO MIX WITHOTHER DRUGS AND ALCOHOL TO INTENSIFY THE HIGH. WE DONT DO THAT. ACTUALLY STATISTICS SHOW THOSE THAT DIED FROM OVERDOSE HAD AN AVERAGR OF 7 DRUGS AND ALCOHOL IN THIER SYSTEM AND LESS TJEN 10 PEOPLE THAT SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN AND ONLY TAKES THE MEDICINE AS DIRECTED LOW DOSE TO HIGH DOSE. THE CDC GUODED BY ANDREW KOLODNEY AND KAISER IS UNFAIR. ONE IS A HUGE HMO THAT IS SAVING BILLIONS BY NOT PRESCRIBING PAIN RELIEVERS AND KOLODNEY OWNS REHAB CLINICS AROUND THE COUNTRY. PAIN.PATIENTS NOT THIER GOOD DOCTORS LIKE DR TENNENT HAVE EVER BEEN CONSULTED OR ASKED FOR THIER ADVICE. SOLUTION TIME GRANDFATHER CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS AND INCREASE THE DOSES THEY WERE UNACCUSTOMED TO. AS LONG AS THEY WERE GOOD PATIENTS PASS THE TESTS AND DO EVERYTHING RIGHT SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED. REALIZE DRUG ADDICTS ARE NOT EFFECTED BY THESE INHUMANE DOSE REDUCTIONS. THEY GET HEROIN ON ANY STREET CORNER. 99.9 % OF US WILL PUT A GUN TO OUR HEAD BEFORE WE CHOOSE TO USE HEROIN OT ANY OTHER ILLEGAL DRUG. THAT IS WHY THE PROPAGANA  THE CDC AND DEA ARE ONLY HURTING GOOD PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, WOUNDED VETS, THOSE WITH CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE FOREVER PAIN. THE JUNKIES ARE NOT AFFECTED 1 BIT.. UNTIL YOU REALIZE THERE ARE TO CLASSES OF PATIENTS. CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS AND DRUG ADDICTS THAT HAVE A DESEASE THAT IS ONLY HELD AT BAY BY A 12 STEP PROGRAM IF THEY WANT TO QUIT BECAUSE THEYRE SICK AND TIRED OF BEING SICK AND TIRED, THE CDC GUIDELINES ARE ONLY CAUSING MORE PAIN AND DEATH TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THIS MEDICINE TO HAVE ANY QUALITY OF LIFE. <br/>Packaging differently will do nothing.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>",

Evidence suggests that past administrations domestic environmental regulation has led some U.S.-based multinationals to invest in other nations especially in manufacturing, , such regulation had a adverse effect on domestic growth. There is widespread belief that new or more stringent environmental regulations raise production costs thereby reducing production which in turn must lead to lower employment (&quot;output effect&quot;). <br/>During the last Administration, significant and escalating regulatory burden was apparent , costs of regulation and realms subject to regulation have grown, while benefits remain ambiguous;  entire sectors of society experience regulation from independent agencies that get little scrutiny;  Federal Register page counts occupy record heights; economically significant and major rules reviewed annually have increased notably over the past decade;  regulatory dark matter outside the normal notice and comment procedure lacks adequate scrutiny.<br/>The Regulatory Right-to-Know Act calls for an analysis of the effects of regulations on small business. In the findings section of SBREFA, Congress states that &quot;small businesses bear a disproportionate share of regulatory costs and burdens.&quot;<br/>Primary task is to double GDP, rather than to double spending or regulatory burdens . Overreach by bureaucracy and the administrative state may not only impede economic efficiency but also undermine health, safety, and environmental progress. Healthy government requires recognizing downsides to coercive intervention; it requires vigilant legislative and executive institutions and mindsets that seek reasons not to add yet another rule or decree to the existing tens of thousands. Public has a right to know the ways federal agencies have harmed and harm that which they oversee, and how those negatives may propagate beyond the agency throughout the economy and society.<br/>Past Rules with the highest estimated costs, come from the EPA, and in particular its Office of Air and Radiation. EPA rules account for 46 to 56 percent of the monetized costs. The annualized estimated cost is $9.6 billion ($2007, using discount rates of 3% and 7%). 2016 was much greater. . EPA&#39;s 2006 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM, with estimated costs of $3 billion per year using 2001 dollars. Far greater today. The Utility MACT rule, which is estimated to be the costliest of the EPA rules, has annualized costs of about $8.2 billion using 2001 dollars. Far greater today. Department of Labor rules taken together could range from about $2.2 billion to $19.1 billion per year (in 2001$)<br/>An important source of uncertainty in the case of health and safety regulations is how to value the regulations&#39; expected reduction in risks to life. Agencies vary in how they estimate the value of a statistical life (VSL), which is best understood not as the &quot;valuation of life,&quot; but as the valuation of statistical mortality risks. Differential toxicity among of PM, EPA, and concluded that the scientific evidence is not yet sufficient to allow differentiation of benefits estimates by particle type, if any. Uncertainty in the PM benefits estimates because a significant portion of the benefits associated with Obama admin. rules are from projected exposure reductions. Two of the particulate matter science experts in 2005 specifically highlighted the uncertainty associated with the fine PM. Source of uncertainty is the assumptions used in projecting the health impact of reducing PM. These projections are based on series of models that take into account emissions changes, resulting distributions of changes in ambient air quality, the estimated reductions in health effects from changes in exposure, and the composition of the population that will benefit from reduced exposure. Component includes assumptions, each with significant level of uncertainty. Although discussed qualitatively in EPA&#39;s regulatory impact analyses, assumption carries uncertainty that is not accounted for in the analysis presented in EPA&#39;s benefits estimates. Uncertainty differ across individual rules, aggregating high and low-end estimates can result in totals that may be misleading.<br/>Past Admin. regulation process did not provide accuracy of prospective analyses in a way that can be brought to bear on such analyses when they are originally written. In short, retrospective analysis should inform prospective analysis. Consistent with the Regulatory Right-to-Know Act. The need to offset the march of bureaucracy and regulation and proposed ideas there should be bipartisan momentum for economic and regulatory reform.

I do not believe a regulation should ever be placed on a Free Citizen of the United States regulating how long one chooses to work! It is not clear to me how people having never operated a commercial motor vehicle can dictate when I can safely pursue my Right to Life, Liberty, and Happiness. <br/><br/>The single truck Independent running under their own Authority is relatively a new phenomena when compared to how long the HOS regulations have been around. I personally do not believe the HOS Regulations have ever been reworked to address this relatively new phenomena. Yes there should be protections for those that may encounter coercion to operate unsafely. But I as an Independent Owner Operator am not subject to any such coercion. In fact it behooves me to operate safely, as I only own one vehicle. I have $180,000 invested in my equipment, the last thing I want to do is damage it by my negligence in operating it unsafely.<br/>There is a quote attributed to George Washington:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>&quot;It will be found an unjust and unwise jealousy to deprive a man of his Natural Liberty upon the supposition that he may abuse it&quot;.<br/><br/>Making me adhere to regulations put in place to keep one from being forced to drive against their will, seems to contradict the words of Mr. Washington.

Description of the Burden:<br/>Anything plugged into a Cummins or Caterpillar ECM that is not Cummins or Caterpillar certified, voids the warranty of the motor.<br/>At this time, neither Cummins nor Caterpillar will conduct a survey to locate and certify ELD&#39;s due to the liability.<br/>The Mandate is forcing any and all Owner-Operators and carriers to install ELDs that can damage the ECM at a cost of thousands of dollars to replace, not to mention void a warranty.   <br/><br/>3. An alternative to this burdensome regulation is:<br/>The ELD should be mandated for carriers who have an extremely poor safety record, who have received written warnings and <br/>do not comply as well as carriers that have a high number of at-fault crashes. It is absolutely unsafe to not have those who have proven poor safety scores and high at-fault crashes, to not be mandated with the ELD.<br/>That being said, also, the engine manufacturers need to be given time to research which ELDs will be compatible<br/>with their ECMs so as not to damage the ECMs and or void the warranty.<br/><br/>4.

This job is not one that you can rush or you and others will most certainly die. I have my reasons for not wanting an ELD in my truck or anyone else&#39;s for that matter. <br/>1. Causes a driver to focus on clock or computer rather than being safe.   I don&#39;t need to be worried about a clock timing me and forcing me to pay attention to it rather than focusing on being safe and driving safe. When you race a clock all normal safe behavior goes out the window.<br/>2. Adds undue stress to an already stressful job causing many health risks.  Stress causes issues with getting adequate rest, it causes us to be unable to operate with our bodies natural rhythms, and many other certifiable stress related illnesses that are already proven by many medical experts<br/>3. Small businesses have to front the costs upfront which already cuts into a small profit margin.  Large corporations and the mega carriers are able to spread the cost over there millions of dollars of profit they ascertain every fiscal year. People like me and all the other smaller business don&#39;t have this luxury. <br/>4. ELD will slow down the production of oil in the Permian Basin. The drilling will slow down and the movement of oil will slow down to a trickle as companies won&#39;t be able to keep up and wells begin to shut in, shut down, or worse spill over. This will only cause us to fall and fail in the petroleum market causing a great many things such as gas and oil to rise in cost.",

I agree with that the petitioner&#39;s proposed standards for warning requirements, instruction requirements, and age restrictions are adequate.<br/><br/>The focus should be on the petitioner&#39;s proposed performance standards. Because of the over 7,700 emergency room visits and one death caused by these magnets, the strength of the magnets is the most important factor when it comes to safety. It is necessary to ensure these claims that the reduced strength of the magnets ensures that magnets will not attach across internal tissue upon ingestion. I believe that the language used to describe the magnet strength standard is too vague and would be difficult to enforce. I believe that there must be a specific maximum magnet strength standard that must be followed. This is because there is variation in the strength of potential users&#39; internal organs which is necessary to account for.<br/><br/>What makes magnets different from other products is the strength and their ability to cause damage to internal organs as well as death. Assuming that the is strength reduced to a non-lethal amount, the magnets should be regulated in the same fashion as similar products with small pieces such LEGOs or products with similar choking/swallowing risk. Therefore, I believe that if these requirements, which would include our changes, will be up to an adequate standard of safety for public use.",

Particularly when it comes to sodium and grain requirements, menu planning can feel like an uphill battle where you are locked in a very limited box.  Considering how laden with sodium all food items have become, the current sodium restrictions seem appropriate, especially considering that children are likely going home and eating foods that are exponentially higher in sodium than what is provided at school.  Severely limiting sodium (at target 2 and final target level) is an admirable goal for enhancing the health of the youth, but the current health crises goes far beyond sodium intake.  <br/><br/>Cutting the current sodium limits nearly in half would only limit SFA&#39;s options for foods and cut into menu diversity.  To put it simply, the more sodium we have to cut out and the more whole grains we have to include, the food becomes increasingly less appealing to the children.  It doesn&#39;t have to be this way, but with the current food market, that&#39;s the way it is.  Advancements in food engineering and technology could make a monumental difference in this aspect and change perceptions on healthy foods, but the current food market does NOT favor healthier food items.  Enforcing cuts to sodium and increases in whole grains at this time would only decrease participation in the NSBP &amp; NSLP, and create problems for SFA&#39;s who need to redesign 180 days worth of breakfast and lunch menus with a very limited number of desirable food options for the children.<br/>",

I know about hunger and going without food myself often as a child, and I can tell you that even one meal a day can keep you healthy enough to get by, although it still is not enough to raise a child optimally. Nutrition is more important than ever with obesity rates booming and while children are developing physically and mentally. Children need healthy nutrition for their developing brains and growing bodies. Children that dont have enough nutrition can develop slower cognitively and physically. Children especially need milk for their bones but they also need milk that is higher in fat content when they are younger. Shrinking the fat content can actually deny children of important fat that they need for growth during the first years of their lives. This has been proven to be true for babies especially. Later, when children reach adolescence they require less milk and milk fats and when they reach adulthood milk should actually be avoided. This is because milk turns into glucose and therefore a sugar which ages the body. These are the latest health facts to date on milk. So high fat milk is important early in childhood, low-fat milk is more desired in adolescence, and an avoidance of milk and alternate form of calcium is optimal in adulthood.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Bleached flour takes the important nutrition out of the wheat by bleaching and the person eating this junk food will be less healthy for the simple reason this white color is more attractive than whole wheat flour. I personally always try to buy I bleached flour for that reason of not wanting to eat empty calories. Children need more calories while they are growing because they expend so much more energy than adults and they are developing their bodies which build on whatever they consume. If schools provide optimal levels of nutrition then the children will have optimal levels growth both physically and mentally. It has also been proven that people that eat nutritional meals have better behavior towards others because they are more able to think about others in a more conscientious manner. School nutrition is a win win situation where children are happier because they are not thinking about food while satiated, they develop better mentally and physically and make for more conscientious adults. Also, when given nutritious foods over junk foods children learn about healthy foods and develop a taste for healthier foods. Junk foods are still also eaten by children and adults and schools cannot monitor children when they are not at school but given good wholesome foods school at least provides a daily buffer against non nutritious foods.",

The &quot;Law of Return,&quot; the rule &quot;Feed the soil, not the plant,&quot; and the promotion of biodiversity, provide the ecological basis for organic production. The Law of Return says that we must return to the soil what we take from the soil. The dictum to &quot;Feed the soil, not the plant&quot; reminds us that the soil is a living superorganism that supports plant life as part of an ecological community. Finally, biological diversity is important to the health of natural ecosystems and agroecosystems. Biodiversity promotes balance, which protects farms from outbreaks of damaging insects and disease. It supports the health of the soil through the progression of the seasons and stresses associated with weather and farming. It supports our health by offering a diversity of foods. Hydroponics is not consistent with these principles.<br/><br/>Containerized culture may be eligible for organic certification under limited circumstances in which organic soil-building and other organic practices are used. These are essentially the same practices that would be required for growing in permanent beds in the soil.<br/><br/>We support the subcommittee proposals for prohibiting hydroponics and delineating acceptable practices for organic containers.<br/>",

    "text": "On behalf of the National Family Farm Coalition, Jim Goodman, an organic dairy and beef farmer from WI and member of Family Farm Defenders, offers the following comments:<br/><br/>&#39;To me, as long as I have known anything about organic, it was healthy soil, healthy crops, healthy animals, healthy people. So, it all starts with the soil, and if there is no soil involved, seems to me it has stepped out of the organic sphere.<br/><br/>The USDA website notes that &quot;USDA certified organic foods are grown and processed according to federal guidelines addressing, among many factors, soil quality, animal raising practices, pest and weed control, and use of additives. Organic producers rely on natural substances and physical, mechanical, or biologically based farming methods to the fullest extent possible&quot;.<br/><br/>Interesting that soil quality is the first factor mentioned, and for good reason. The nutrient cycle, or in current terminology regenerative agriculture, has always been a cornerstone of organic farming - agriculture whereby the soil is managed to increase its fertility, reducing or eliminating the need for outside fertility inputs. Hydroponic agriculture is the exact opposite of regenerative agriculture in that all fertility inputs need to be added to the system. Organic farmers strive for a self-renewing system, as they are and should be, required by USDA organic regulations. With hydroponics a self-renewing system is impossible.<br/><br/>On principal, I am not opposed to hydroponics, as I am not opposed to sustainable farming practices - those practices utilized by good farmers who do the right thing but do not ascribe to all the organic rules - and that&#39;s OK. <br/><br/>Hydroponic tomatoes grown in the northern winter are, in some ways better than shipping &quot;organic&quot; tomatoes in from Mexico, but hydroponic production systems, by their nature, are not organic. Since they depend solely on added inputs I would question if they even fall into the realm of sustainable agriculture.<br/><br/>Hydroponics may produce acceptable vegetables, but, sorry, organic is about the soil. Don&#39;t try to take that away from us, who, as farmers, have spent our lives trying to save and improve the soil.&#39;<br/><br/>National Family Farm Coalition supports Mr. Goodman&#39;s assertion that organic is in the soil and can not be duplicated by nutrients and other additives transmitted to plants grown hydroponically. USDA organic standards should continue to require that:  &quot;USDA certified organic foods are grown and processed according to federal guidelines addressing, among many factors, soil quality, animal raising practices, pest and weed control, and use of additives.&quot;<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to submit these comments.<br/><br/>",

The Clean Water Rule is based on clear and overwhelming science with over 1,200 scientific studies that demonstrate the connections between tributary streams and other upstream waters on larger downstream waters like lakes and rivers.  The Rule MUST have effective safeguards of threams, wetlands, and other waters required by the Clean Water Act.  While some agriculturalists have stated their objections to the Rule as impinging on their land, they are simply wrong.  The Rule, as proposed, has definitions and safeguards to prevent precisely the things they are objecting to.  We must give anglers and all users of our lakes and streams the confidence that the waters in which they play, recreate, or depend on for drinking water are safe and healthy.  The Clean Water Rule does this.  It should NOT be modified as proposed by the Trump Administration, delayed, or weakened.  Our waters--indeed, our future--depends on the implementation of the Clean Water Rule.   James L. Pease, Ph.D.  3840 Stagecoach Road, Ames, IA 50010",

I&#39;m a sportsman and I strongly oppose repealing the Clean Water Rule.<br/><br/>Finalized in 2015, the Rule clarifies that the Clean Water Act protects 20 million acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of headwater streams -- 60% of the country&#39;s flowing waters. These waters shield communities from flooding, supply drinking water to one in three Americans, and provide essential fish and wildlife habitat that supports a robust outdoor recreation economy worth $887 billion annually. The hunting and fishing industries in the United States directly employ 483,000 Americans.<br/><br/>The Clean Water Rule is firmly grounded in science. In developing the rule, EPA analyzed more than 1,200 peer-reviewed and other studies that assessed connections between small streams, non-tidal wetlands, and other upstream waters on larger downstream waters, including lakes, rivers, and estuaries. That review demonstrated the significant physical, chemical and biological connections between wetlands and headwaters streams to larger rivers. To balance the need to protect our nation&#39;s waters with the interests of those whose activities affect water quality, the Rule also explicitly excludes some waters, like puddles and most roadside ditches, from regulation. The agencies also preserved existing exemptions for categories of activities like normal farming and ranching practices.<br/><br/>I also believe that repealing the Clean Water Rule and codifying the status quo will lead to uncertainty for States, federal and states water quality personnel, those who need permits and the public. In the last ten years, the &quot;status quo&quot; has hurt the efforts of sportsmen and women to protect water resources; contributed to permit delays; and left Corps water quality personnel spending large amounts of time trying to decide which waters the Clean Water Act protects. The Corps will now continue to make permitting decisions on a case-by-case basis indefinitely, and as a result, it will cause uncertainty for all involved in permitting. In addition, the 2008 guidance document that the Corps is using as the &quot;status quo&quot; to decide jurisdiction was not based on publicly available scientific, technical, or economic analyses, and it was never published in the Federal Register for public comment. This document is no substitute for a properly-issued rule.<br/>I am an avid fisherman and see how the Clean Water Act has made fishing much better in the area I grew up in Ohio. Streams and rivers that were dead are now full of fish and people are fishing in these streams and rivers. Do not repeal the Clean Water Act or these streams and rivers will once again become polluted and unfishable.<br/><br/>To justify the repeal, the agencies rely on a seriously flawed economic analysis. To arrive at a net benefit justifying repeal of the 2015 Rule, the agencies removed the estimated $306 billion in annual benefits that would result from the 2015 Rule protecting wetlands. The agencies have said Americans may value streams and wetlands less than they did in 2014, but they don&#39;t give any reason why the public would value clean water less than they did before. As a sportsman, I value clean water and I support conserving our wetlands and small streams.<br/><br/>Repealing the Clean Water Rule is a huge step backward in achieving the goal of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the nation&#39;s waters. I believe in the goal of the Clean Water Act and I respectfully ask that you protect the streams and wetlands so important to hunters and anglers.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Mr. John Coyne<br/>17 Mountainside Ave<br/>Stockholm, NJ 07460-1905<br/>(862) 345-5063",
