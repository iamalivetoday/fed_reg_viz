    "text": "Director, Regulation Policy and Management, Department of Veterans Affairs<br/><br/>Comments are submitted in response to RIN 2900-AQ06 Authority of Health Care Providers to Practice Telehealth.<br/><br/>I am a MBA student with Freed Hardeman University currently studying Business Law.  I would like to begin my comment with appreciation for the work done on behalf of those who risk life and limb to ensure our freedoms and safety.<br/><br/>The issue, as I understand, is the need for expansion of the VA telehealth program to be able to operate with health care providers who will provide services via telehealth to beneficiaries in states in which they are not licensed, registered, certified, or located or where they are not authorized to furnish care via this method therefore limiting the practice and benefits available to veterans.  Currently, and without passage of the aforementioned ruling, caregivers who dare to cross state lines are exposed to risk and repercussions including fines or imprisonment for unauthorized practice of medicine.<br/><br/>I offer full support to expand the program and protect our healthcare providers by exercising Federal preemption of State licensure, registration, and certification laws, rules, regulations, or requirements to the extent that State laws conflict with their ability to practice telehealth while working within the scope of VA employment.<br/><br/>The telehealth program has been proven successful in many instances as a practical alternative to brick and mortar patient care.  According to Technical Brief Number 26 Telehealth: Mapping the Evidence for Patient Outcomes From Systematic Reviews retrieved from https://ahrq-ehc-application.s3.amazonaws.com/media/pdf/telehealth_technical-brief.pdf &quot;A large volume of research reported that telehealth interventions produce positive outcomes when used for remote patient monitoring, broadly defined, for several chronic conditions and for psychotherapy as part of behavioral health.  The most consistent benefit has been reported when telehealth is used for communication and counseling or remote monitoring in chronic conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease, with improvements in outcomes such as mortality, quality of life, and reductions in hospital admissions.&quot;<br/><br/>As you are well aware the accessibility of existing clinical services are very limited especially in rural and remote areas.  Mobility and transportation restrictions also hinder many veterans from receiving the necessary initial treatment or ongoing care.  The expansion of the telehealth program would provide accessible, high quality, cost effective care to all veterans within the national healthcare system.<br/><br/>",

    "docAbstract": "The Department of Veterans\nAffairs (VA) proposes to amend its\nmedical regulations by standardizing\nthe delivery of care by VA health care\nproviders through telehealth. This rule\nwould ensure that VA health care\nproviders provide the same level of care\nto all beneficiaries, irrespective of the\nState or location in a State of the VA\nhealth care provider or the beneficiary.\nThis proposed rule would achieve\nimportant Federal interests by\nincreasing the availability of mental\nhealth, specialty, and general clinical\ncare for all beneficiaries."

If a breeder fails an inspection, they are failing the animals they care for, and the people they serve.<br/><br/>The reason we inspect animal care facilities is to ensure that they are upholding the established standards that protect animals from harm and keep them healthy. If an inspection fails and the breeder is still allowed to operate, it sends a clear message that the animals in their care are not as important as the tax revenue that comes from that business. ",

    "text": "I&#39;m writing in response to a request for comments by the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration (FMCSA) regarding an application for exemption [Docket No. FMCSA-2017-0243] from requirements to use electronic logging devices (ELDs) submitted by the Power &amp; Communication Contractors Association (PCCA). PCCA represents contractors, manufacturers, and distributors who build and repair America&#39;s power and communications infrastructure, including electric transmission, distribution, and substation facilities and broadband, telephone, and cable television systems. As a member of PCCA, I strongly support this exemption request. Drivers in the power and communications construction industry operate under significantly different circumstances than interstate truck drivers and should not be burdened with the harmful impacts of the ELD rule, pending December of this year. <br/><br/>On a typical workday, construction workers spend short amounts of time driving, unlike typical over-the-road truck drivers who spend most of their time driving in a single vehicle. Contractors spend considerable time working off-road on the jobsite, not on public roads or highways, and a single CMV may have several different drivers over the course of a day. Drivers working on broadband and/or electric infrastructure projects commonly drive multiple vehicles for short distances within a single day, and a single vehicle is often driven by multiple drivers. We operate a wide range of vehicles such as flatbeds, skid trucks, dump trucks, and buses used to transport workers and equipment to and from a particular jobsite. Because of the limited time within a workday that our drivers spend driving on public roads, ELD and RODS requirements for drivers in our industries will not result in increased safety. <br/><br/>Drivers in our industry use numerous exemptions to hours-of-service requirements in order to keep the lights on, such as the utility service vehicle and short haul exemptions. Because of this, our drivers will very rarely have to use ELDs. Yet, the final ELD rule will force our industry to purchase and install ELDs, train on the use of ELDs, and monitor drivers who will very rarely (if ever) need to log in to an ELD.<br/><br/>Navigating ELD requirements when drivers may fall under varying exemptions will make compliance difficult, exposing our drivers to unknowing violations. As an employer in this important industry, I would rather dedicate dollars for training on more relevant safety issues. Exempting PCCA contractors from the ELD rule would not compromise the safety of commercial drivers in any way, and power and communication contractors will continue to meet all other HOS requirements overseen by FMCSA.<br/><br/>The ELD rule allows drivers to use paper logs for recording on-duty status where they exceed the limitation of the short haul exemption on not more than 8 days out of every 30-day period. While the full exemption requested in the PCCA application is warranted and should be provided for the power and communication construction industry, there are steps the agency could take to alleviate regulatory burdens associated with this rule. If FMCSA were to extend the number of days allowing drivers to use written paper logs when they exceed the requirements of the short-haul exception from 8 days to 16 days, some relief from the burden of this rule would be provided. Still, it seems that the most effective way to address these issues would be through a full exemption of drivers in our industry.  <br/> <br/>PCCA submitted comments in support of an exemption request by the Pipe Line Contractors Association [Docket No. FMCSA-2017-0175] for many of the same reasons. As part of the construction industry, I support the PLCA exemption request as well. Construction drivers meet a variety of job functions and spend the vast majority of their time on a jobsite within a short distance of their daily assembly point, not on public roads and highways. Exempting construction workers from ELD requirements will allow employers to better focus their energies and resources.",

    "text": "My name is Angela Acuna and I have been suffering from Alopecia Areata since 2009.  At that time I was a junior in college, taking a full course load, working and rowing as a Division 1 athlete.  I had no time for anything else, but I can tell you that dealing with hair falling out and obsessing over the spots on my head took away time and energy I didn&#39;t have from everything else.  I tried everything over the years - prednisone ladders, injections in my scalp each month, therapy, even taking statins as my doctor said some people were seeing growth resulting in taking that.  Nothing worked, I was devastated.  I spent years being devastated.  I loved exercising, but I hated having to wash my hair more often and see the clumps fall down the drain, so I just stopped exercising.  Every single night was emotionally draining.  I avoided dating - how could I ever let anyone I was romantically interested in see my head?  I felt like I looked like Dobby from Harry Potter.  I was in my early 20s, supposed to be living life to the fullest, and instead I isolated myself from everyone.<br/><br/>I only took control of my life in 2016 when I had lost about 80% of my hair I shaved my head and started wearing wigs. Back in 2009 I never thought it would come to that point.  I really wish it didn&#39;t have to come to that, but it was the uncertainty that killed me.  Was this the only spot I would have?  When will my hair stop falling out?  Is it even growing back?  Most people I talk to about this disease feel the same - the uncertainty is the worst.  Everything is out of our control, doctors don&#39;t really know what is happening or why it is happening.  There are no explanations, no real treatments, nothing.  <br/><br/>I thank you for holding this meeting and I urge you to work hard to find something to help answer our questions.  I have heard since I was diagnosed that they are working hard towards treatments, but we need your help to get those treatments to us.  Honestly, at this point I have given up - please restore my faith that one day I will have hair again.  <br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Angela Acuna",

The 2015 rule was developed by a comprehensive process led by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, the two agencies with the greatest responsibility for investigation and enforcement of water-related regulations. The purpose of the rule was to provide a standardized definition of WOTUS and clarify the muddle of regulations and court rulings that fostered costly legal disputes and delays in permitting processes across the nation. A return to the pre-2015 regulations would diminish the ability of developers, planners, state agencies, and the public to understand what bodies of water are protected under Federal law. It would also remove the much-needed protections from headwater streams and wetlands which are vital to the continued quality of downstream waters used for navigation and drinking water.<br/><br/>Determinations of which water bodies are protected and of what constitutes pollution should be made by agency professionals with guidance from qualified professionals in aquatic science and public health and with input from the public. The role of politicians is to ensure that the recommendations of knowledgeable professionals are put into law to protect public health and our shared natural resources. The role of judges is to see that those laws are upheld. The lengthy process that generated the 2015 Clean Water Rule was very public and included input from a myriad of stakeholders, including all sectors described above. The public comment period resulted in a million comments; of these, a whopping 87% supported the Clean Water Rule! <br/><br/>The citizens of our great nation overwhelmingly recognize the need to protect clean water, and they understand the necessity of having clear definitions of what we are protecting.

I support the subcommittee recommendation to prohibit aquaponics and aeroponics.  I agree that there is a continuum from 100% hydroponics to field based soil production.  The concept that container media production is allowed if a substrate is present that will allow for typical soil-plant microbial relations makes sense, along with a restriction on the amount of fertility supplied to the plant in a soluble form, per the sodium nitrate restriction. Thus I support the proposed requirement to limit soluble nutrients to 20% in container production, and support the definition of hydroponic and its prohibition under the organic rule. <br/>",

    "text": "Dear Administrator Scott Pruitt,<br/><br/>I am writing today to express my opposition to the proposed action to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule. I am concerned that repealing this rule will put our nation&#39;s headwaters at greater risk and increase uncertainty for the health of our nation&#39;s rivers and all water bodies downstream.<br/><br/>I have worked for California&#39;s Water Quality Control Board for 31 years and am intimately familiar with the Clean Water Act and the challenges it faces every day.  Even with this act in place, our waterways face increasing pressures and it becomes increasingly harder to protect all of their beneficial uses.  In addition, we need to protect the tributaries to federally protected waterways.  Without tributary protection, pollutants flow into federal waters.<br/><br/>I have also been a white water rafting guide for 30 years, and as such have personally witnessed the recovery that has occurred on our nation&#39;s waterways since the Clean Water Act was enacted in 1972. However we are still far from meeting the Act&#39;s goal of making all our waterways fishable, swimmable and drinkable. Repealing the Clean Water Rule of 2015 will further compromise our ability to protect and improve the health of our nation&#39;s rivers.<br/><br/>I strongly disagree with the proposal to reinstate the regulations that existed before the 2015 Clean Water Rule. Doing so will only increase uncertainty and continuity in implementing the Clean Water Act, running counter to the goals of the rulemaking. Likewise, pursuing a future rulemaking to conduct a substantive re-evaluation of the definition of &quot;Waters of the United States&quot; does the same.<br/><br/>For the health of our nation&#39;s rivers, I ask that you defend the rule the 2015 Clean Water Rule in court and cease efforts to repeal the rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms. Wendy Wyels<br/>4520 Monte Vista Dr  Camino, CA 95709-9310<br/>wendysue1@comcast.net",

Repealing this vital safeguard will put our health, economy, and communities in Maine at risk. <br/><br/>Clean water is the backbone of healthy communities and essential for a strong economy. This repeal will remove Clean Water Act protections for the streams that feed the drinking water sources for more than one in three Americans. It would endanger 20 million acres of wetlands that provide habitat for wildlife throughout the nation. It could allow the pollution and destruction of the water resources that small businesses like craft breweries and outdoor recreation companies in Maine rely on. Maine&#39;s economy receives $8.2 billion in spending on outdoor recreation annually, and much of that recreation depends on clean water. <br/><br/>Repealing the Clean Water Rule is shortsighted and flies in the face of public opinion.

    "text": "Jul 27, 2017<br/><br/>Dear Administrator Pruitt and Deputy Assistant Secretary Lamont,<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Docket Number EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0203, which repeals the 2015 Clean Water Rule. I&#39;m a sportsman and I strongly oppose repealing the Clean Water Rule.<br/><br/>Finalized in 2015, the Rule clarifies that the Clean Water Act protects<br/>20 million acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of headwater streams -- 60% of the country&#39;s flowing waters. These waters shield communities from flooding, supply drinking water to one in three Americans, and provide essential fish and wildlife habitat that supports a robust outdoor recreation economy worth $887 billion annually. The hunting and fishing industries in the United States directly employ 483,000 Americans.<br/><br/>The Clean Water Rule is firmly grounded in science. In developing the rule, EPA analyzed more than 1,200 peer-reviewed and other studies that assessed connections between small streams, non-tidal wetlands, and other upstream waters on larger downstream waters, including lakes, rivers, and estuaries. That review demonstrated the significant physical, chemical and biological connections between wetlands and headwaters streams to larger rivers. To balance the need to protect our nation&#39;s waters with the interests of those whose activities affect water quality, the Rule also explicitly excludes some waters, like puddles and most roadside ditches, from regulation. The agencies also preserved existing exemptions for categories of activities like normal farming and ranching practices.<br/><br/>Waterways are not only important for lands and animals but for the soul and American spirit.  We are the only country that has these types of lands and it&#39;s important that we keep them so that my children and their children can enjoy them as well.  We have the opportunity to do right by us, our future and history.  It&#39;s a unique opportunity that cannot be denied.<br/><br/>I also believe that repealing the Clean Water Rule and codifying the status quo will lead to uncertainty for States, federal and states water quality personnel, those who need permits and the public. In the last ten years, the &quot;status quo&quot; has hurt the efforts of sportsmen and women to protect water resources; contributed to permit delays; and left Corps water quality personnel spending large amounts of time trying to decide which waters the Clean Water Act protects. The Corps will now continue to make permitting decisions on a case-by-case basis indefinitely, and as a result, it will cause uncertainty for all involved in permitting. In addition, the 2008 guidance document that the Corps is using as the &quot;status quo&quot; to decide jurisdiction was not based on publicly available scientific, technical, or economic analyses, and it was never published in the Federal Register for public comment. This document is no substitute for a properly-issued rule.<br/><br/>To justify the repeal, the agencies rely on a seriously flawed economic analysis. To arrive at a net benefit justifying repeal of the 2015 Rule, the agencies removed the estimated $306 billion in annual benefits that would result from the 2015 Rule protecting wetlands. The agencies have said Americans may value streams and wetlands less than they did in 2014, but they don&#39;t give any reason why the public would value clean water less than they did before. As a sportsman, I value clean water and I support conserving our wetlands and small streams.<br/><br/>Repealing the Clean Water Rule is a huge step backward in achieving the goal of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the nation&#39;s waters. I believe in the goal of the Clean Water Act and I respectfully ask that you protect the streams and wetlands so important to hunters and anglers.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Mr. Taylor Gloege<br/>3976 Alcazar Dr<br/>Castle Rock, CO 80109-3649<br/>",

    "text": "<br/>To the CPSC Committee,<br/><br/>This comment is in regard to ASTM f207 that requires expensive, frequent, and unhelpful testing of infant slings.<br/><br/>I am a handweaver and a stay at home mother to two. I quit a job that did not cover the cost of daycare in order to stay home and care for my kids while working part time to sell my handwoven fabric. I am one of hundreds of women who found this as a viable option. This option was effectively stolen from us with the passing of the very controversial ASTM f207 standard that requires structural testing by a third party of all infant slings with a material change. <br/><br/>My business comes from mothers and caregivers who want a sling made especially for them. I make less than 40 slings per year. ASTM f207 would require me to test the majority of those, while losing the time, money, and supplies that went in to that sling. This is completely unfeasible and will result in the loss of an art and ability of hundreds of women and weavers to provide essential income for their families.<br/><br/>As most weavers, I am perfectly happy to test that my products are safe. Every inch of 960 threads that goes in to each of my wraps is personally inspected by me, if not made by me through handspinning. I am exceedingly confident that their structural integrity will withstand proper use. Lack of structural integrity has never resulted in a reported incident in the type of sling I make (handwoven wraps), so why the committee decided structural testing would help prevent injuries that result from improper use is beyond me.<br/><br/>To help maintain the livelihoods of women like me who need this meager income to be able to care for their families, I implore you to consider these two options:<br/><br/>Consider removing the durable goods label from handwoven infant slings so as artisans we can apply for a small batch manufacture exception. Then this is the official durable goods reg - Section 104(f) of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA)<br/><br/>Amend ASTM f207 to include an exemption for handwoven goods that focuses on literature, instructions, and safety information (the only culprit of injury from handwoven slings) instead of structural integrity testing. Apply an industry standard for warnings that prevent injury instead of structural testing that prevents nothing and kills business. <br/><br/>There is a group called the BCIA (Baby Carrier Industry Alliance) that has lobbied for ASTM f207 and claims to speak for us, as micro businesses and artisans. They have continually failed dismally to address the valid concerns of handweavers while claiming they are the only voice we have and that the result of ASTM f207 on small businesses will be insignificant. This is untrue. Several dozen weavers have announced that they have to shut down their business as a direct result of ASTM f207, and yet BCIA continues to discourage people from commenting on this open comment period. <br/><br/>I implore you to consider either of my proposals in order to help maintain dozens of families.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Sophie Derrick<br/><br/>Mtoto Wovens",

    "text": "Suspicionless mass monitoring of immigrants via social media is not only xenophobic, privacy-invasive, speech-chilling, and downright un-American -- it isn&#39;t even going to work. <br/><br/>How will DHS determine which accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other services belong to existing or would-be immigrants to the U.S., rather than natural-born U.S. citizens? (That is, assuming the agency cares if someone falls into the latter category. Given the number of times a year DHS throws American citizens into immigration detention and even deports them, it has shown that it does not care very much about false positives and the collateral damage they wreak on people&#39;s lives.) Anonymous and pseudonymous accounts abound on these services. Many people share the same first and last names, so even a real name attached to an account might need disambiguation. Further, many people have multiple accounts: an &quot;official&quot; account, meant to be seen by parents, potential employers, and the like; and another, more secretive account kept separate from one&#39;s &quot;real&quot; identity. How much taxpayer money is DHS going to waste on this challenge?<br/><br/>The &quot;commercial data providers&quot; source category is also unsettling. Data brokers collect and sell information about people, which they gather from public, governmental, and commercial sources. As a 2014 FTC report on data brokers notes, a data broker&#39;s dossier on an individual might identify her social media accounts. Of the nine brokers the FTC report studied, DHS currently contracts with two: Corelogic and Recorded Future. (That&#39;s in addition to other major data brokers such as LexisNexis, credit bureaus like Equifax and TransUnion, and various background-check companies, among many others.) Troublingly, however, these dossiers aren&#39;t necessarily accurate. The risk of false positives and false negatives makes DHS&#39;s use of &quot;commercial data providers&quot; for immigration record purposes even more troubling.<br/><br/>Leaving aside the privacy intrusions, this policy is going to chill a massive amount of legitimate, lawful speech. People have the right under the First Amendment to speak anonymously, and to speak their minds online and off. The First Amendment covers non-citizens in the U.S., not just citizens (including naturalized citizens, whose inclusion under this policy is downright chilling). But this policy is going to scare immigrants to our country out of expressing political views, including criticism of the federal government. Any opinion that they imagine could possibly be used against them someday, no matter how innocuous, they&#39;re going to silence. That&#39;s not what America is about. <br/><br/>Not only will this policy chill legitimate speech, it&#39;s going to make the job of national security - the ostensible purpose of this policy - harder, not easier. That is because someone who might otherwise make true threats online that would tip DHS off to their bad intent, is now going to know their social media are being monitored. They will clam up or move the conversation to a medium that is not under mass surveillance. So the only possible legitimate purpose to this policy will be undermined by the policy&#39;s very existence. <br/><br/>What is more, the number of people in the U.S. - native-born or otherwise - who are plotting against it is vanishingly small. Most Americans, including the tens of millions of Americans who were born elsewhere, simply wish to live their lives in peace and take advantage of the opportunities this great country affords. That means that the &quot;red flag&quot; speech that this policy will drive underground, is minuscule compared to the vast amount of legitimate, lawful speech that will be suppressed by the chilling effect of this policy.<br/><br/>In short, this policy has a huge downside, and it negates its own minuscule possible upside.<br/><br/>One might almost think the entire point of the social media policy is to scare immigrants out of exercising their First Amendment rights, not the actual protection of the country and its denizens.<br/>",

This is costing my employer several million dollars for a system that really doesn&#39;t work very well. I am personally involved in testing and training for the mandate. I have found several flaws in the software, substantial losses in driver productivity as a direct consequence of the ELD, and annoyance among the drivers to the point that some are ready to quit. That is despite a critical shortage of drivers deployed. This whole mandate is making the hardware and software suppliers rich, and everyone else is suffering. Quite frankly, there is more wrong with the ELD than there is right. Those who are running afoul of the present regulations will find a way to circumvent new regulations as well.",

    "text": "In order to better promote sustained compliance with the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) and prevent individuals and businesses who are unfit to hold a license from obtaining one, it is imperative the regulatory framework consider animal cruelty convictions or other violations of Federal, state, or local laws or regulations pertaining to animals when granting licenses to work with regulated animals. Animal cruelty violations, in and of themselves, merit a conclusion that the individual or business is unfit to work with animals in any capacity. Such persons should also be prohibited from engaging in other activities involving animals regulated under the AWA, including working for other AWA-regulated entities or using other individual names or business entities to apply for a license. The cycle of abuse must be stopped at the onset, and providing a license to someone who may have been convicted of animal cruelty without knowing is aiding in the continuous cycle. As is permitting someone who has been convicted of animal cruelty charges to work with other AWA-regulated entities.  ",

    "text": "Animal Welfare: Procedures for Applying for License and Renewals has some very strong points in the proposed regulation. The Animal Welfare Act worked to create guidelines to fix the problems with animal licensing for animal research. Establishing a firm expiration date for licenses and after which a license expires, the licensee must be able to demonstrate compliance before getting another license. Regulations and conditions change in a few years and mandating that licensees need to renew their license would make them prove that they are following the rules. According to crueltyfreeinternational.org, America continues to be one of the top countries who participate in animal research and this regulation would continue to regulate this industry. Some countries such as China and the UK have the same regulation as they did in the 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s, which is why America must work to update their rules in animal research. This new regulation would also require license applicants to disclose any animal cruelty convictions or other violations of Federal, State or local laws or regulations pertaining to animals. The AWA is the only Federal Act is the only Federal law that protects animals in this kind of research which means the Public Health Services covers the animals in research. PHS does not conduct inspections. Instead, they ask on institutions to inspect their own lab. I believe that section of the new Animal Welfare Act will make sure that research facilities who doesn&#39;t conduct these inspections or pass them will allow the APHIS to know. This new regulation would also streamline the procedure for denying a license application, terminating a license, and summarily suspending a license. I believe this recommendation would allow the AWA to issue termination and other disciplinary actions quicker to fix the problem faster. This section also allows for facilities who can&#39;t pass their own inspection or have a past with not following laws to have their license taken away quicker. I believe this new regulation with the Animal Welfare Act will hold research facilities more accountable and make sure that they are following the rules correctly, especially since they are dealing humane animals.

    "text": "<br/>Aug 3, 2017<br/><br/>Deputy Assistant Secretary Douglas Lamont<br/><br/>Dear Administrator Pruitt  and Deputy Assistant Secretary Lamont Deputy Assistant Secretary Lamont,<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Docket Number EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0203, which repeals the 2015 Clean Water Rule. I&#39;m a sportsman and I strongly oppose repealing the Clean Water Rule.<br/><br/>Finalized in 2015, the Rule clarifies that the Clean Water Act protects<br/>20 million acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of headwater streams -- 60% of the country&#39;s flowing waters. These waters shield communities from flooding, supply drinking water to one in three Americans, and provide essential fish and wildlife habitat that supports a robust outdoor recreation economy worth $887 billion annually. The hunting and fishing industries in the United States directly employ 483,000 Americans.<br/><br/>The Clean Water Rule is firmly grounded in science. In developing the rule, EPA analyzed more than 1,200 peer-reviewed and other studies that assessed connections between small streams, non-tidal wetlands, and other upstream waters on larger downstream waters, including lakes, rivers, and estuaries. That review demonstrated the significant physical, chemical and biological connections between wetlands and headwaters streams to larger rivers. To balance the need to protect our nation&#39;s waters with the interests of those whose activities affect water quality, the Rule also explicitly excludes some waters, like puddles and most roadside ditches, from regulation. The agencies also preserved existing exemptions for categories of activities like normal farming and ranching practices.<br/><br/>In the last ten years, the &quot;status quo&quot; has hurt the efforts of sportsmen and women to protect water resources; contributed to permit delays; and left Corps water quality personnel spending large amounts of time trying to decide which waters the Clean Water Act protects.<br/><br/>The Corps will now continue to make permitting decisions on a case-by-case basis indefinitely, and as a result, it will cause uncertainty for all involved in permitting. I believe this will ultimately damage not only our environment, but the ability for organizations to conduct business in an effective, environmentally-sustainable manner.<br/><br/>In addition, the 2008 guidance document that the Corps is using as the &quot;status quo&quot; to decide jurisdiction was not based on publicly available scientific, technical, or economic analyses, and it was never published in the Federal Register for public comment.<br/><br/>This document is no substitute for a properly-issued rule.<br/><br/>To justify the repeal, the agencies rely on a seriously flawed economic analysis. To arrive at a net benefit justifying repeal of the 2015 Rule, the agencies removed the estimated $306 billion in annual benefits that would result from the 2015 Rule protecting wetlands. The agencies have said Americans may value streams and wetlands less than they did in 2014, but they don&#39;t give any reason why the public would value clean water less than they did before. As a sportsman, I value clean water and I support conserving our wetlands and small streams.<br/><br/>Repealing the Clean Water Rule is a huge step backward in achieving the goal of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the nation&#39;s waters. I believe in the goal of the Clean Water Act and I respectfully ask that you protect the streams and wetlands so important to hunters and anglers.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Mr. Matthew Cunningham<br/>316 Linden Ave<br/>Southgate, KY 41071-3216<br/><br/>",

    "text": "I write today on behalf of thousands of Environmental Action&#39;s members and supporters who oppose the Administration&#39;s proposal to repeal and redefine the Definition of Waters of United States rule (RIN:2010-AF74).<br/><br/>Attached and below, you will find the names of 16,403 people who signed our online petition:<br/><br/>We, the undersigned, strongly oppose the administration&#39;s proposal to rescind the Waters of the United States Rule (RIN: 2010-AF74). <br/><br/>The rule would improve water quality for roughly 119 million Americans that would provide. These are waters that help ensure safe, drinkable water. They fill summer swimming spots and fishing holes. They provide vital habitat for wildlife and enjoyment for millions of Americans. <br/><br/>The administration cites onerous economic impacts of the Clean Water rule as justification for rescinding these clean water protections. Yet its latest analysis excludes any analysis of the benefits of keeping pesticides, mining and agricultural runoff and other pollutants out of our water. In contrast, the Obama administration -- which explicitly looked at the economic impacts of reduced pollution in a years-long process -- estimated the Clean Water Rule&#39;s net benefits at nearly $400 million. <br/><br/>Maybe that&#39;s why 80 percent of small business owners favor federal rules for clean water to protect upstream headwaters, according to a national survey by the American Sustainable Business Council. <br/><br/>Clean water is vital to the health of our communities and a healthy environment. We urge the administration to end its efforts to rescind the Clean Water Rule and commit to cleaner water for all of us. <br/><br/>Because these petition signers represent diverse interests, opinions and backgrounds, we ask that their signatures be counted as individual comments for the purposes of gauging public opposition to the administration&#39;s proposal (attached).  <br/><br/>For your convenience, the petition is viewable online at http://bit.ly/2y6UuVO. Please feel free to contact me at Sally@environmental-action.org or 202-461-2449 x349 if you have any questions about our comments.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration and for ensuring a detailed accounting of the significant public opposition to this proposal.<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/><br/>Sally King<br/>Environmental Action<br/>",

    "text": "Medicare&#39;s proposal to reform and stop abuse of the 340B drug discount program is a good idea and should be supported. <br/><br/>340B is a critically important program for uninsured, underinsured, and vulnerable sick patients and it must be protected. Unfortunately, some greedy hospitals have figured out that they can abuse the program and profit off of discounts by selling discount drugs at full price. This has led the program to grow enormously without any meaningful oversight or accountability.<br/><br/>For America&#39;s cancer patients and cancer care system, the abuses of the 340B program is causing serious problems. It is costing patients and taxpayers billions of dollars more for care that could be delivered in community oncology clinics which are more convenient and cost far less.<br/><br/>Putting profits before patients is bad for those who truly need 340B discounts and American&#39;s who rely on quality, affordable, and accessible local cancer care. This is especially true for rural and underserved communities where there are few local cancer care providers.<br/><br/>We should hold 340B hospitals to the standards of accountability and transparency that other program participants must meet. This will ensure that the public and taxpayers can truly understand how the discounts are being used. I cannot believe that hospitals can keep profits from 340B to use as they want - on executive bonuses, new luxury buildings, and other non-patient things.<br/><br/>Reform the 340B program is long overdue. I support CMS&#39; efforts to fix 340B so that it serves the patients in need who need it, not hospital bottom lines!<br/>",

    "text": "I am an oncologist in the community and I strongly support 340B reform.  This program was a great idea to get patients with no insurance the cancer treatment they need, but it has turned into a huge rip off of the Medicare patient.  The hospitals buy drugs at rock bottom prices and then sell them to Medicare patients and other insured patients at full retail, and the profits to the hospitals are huge.  They then use those profits to &quot;buy&quot; the local, struggling cancer offices thus eliminating their competition and giving them more profit.<br/>All of this jacks up the price of cancer care in thousands of communities for the Medicare patients who have to, ultimately, foot the bill.<br/>Also, think about it, if a large pharma company needs to charge a thousand bucks for a drug to get it distributed and into the market, and thousands of hospital cancer centers use this 340B law to only pay 500 bucks, well, you don&#39;t have to be a brain surgeon to realize that they will now need to charge the Medicare patient 2000 bucks.  Wonder why drug prices are so high?<br/>This has to stop because the community oncologist, who owns and runs his own practice, and employs dozens of people and provides jobs and pays taxes in his community, AND takes great care of cancer patients while being very cost effective and efficient, well, this community oncologist simply can&#39;t compete with a huge, new Taj Mahal-type hospital cancer center with a huge marketing budget, that gets to pay 50 cents on the dollar for the major overhead item: cancer drugs.  Excellent  non-biased research shows that the community oncologist is much much more cost effective for the medicare patient than an oncologist employed by a 340B cancer center.  So, if we put the local cancer doctor out of business (or drive them to fold their practices into a hospital) prices will skyrocket--and that is happening daily right now.<br/>In my community, we have a 340B center.  The hospital spent 30 million dollars to build it, it has a starbucks in the lobby, and they have hired 7 young oncologists to churn out profits for them.<br/>Wrong is wrong and if this isn&#39;t wrong on every level, I don&#39;t know what is.<br/>I&#39;ll offer a solution instead of just complaining:  make the 340B designation attach to the PATIENT, not to the hospital or cancer center.  That way, charity care will go to charity patients and 340B cancer centers will be forced to be smart, efficient, honorable businesspeople just like us.<br/><br/>",

When a school or a school district doesn&#39;t treat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws required the Department of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. I support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve. <br/><br/>Our education system is unfair to too many students and communities. Students who are Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, immigrants, English learners, girls, LGBTQ or students with disabilities face too many barriers to educational success. We need to use all of the tools we can to change that problem and make sure ALL children get the education they deserve.  Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them. I oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.<br/>As a minority student in the 1950&#39;s, I was subjected to hateful language and name calling on my elementary school campus, and no one in authority ever came to my aide or punished or corrected the abusive and bigoted students. In junior high school in a slightly more diverse neighborhood, I was followed part way home and jumped by a group of 3 girls calling me horrid things. I didn&#39;t even report it as my experience taught me that I didn&#39;t matter. No child should be so damaged by schools that do not teach and reward tolerance and compassion. It&#39;s the Department of Education&#39;s job to help our nation&#39;s schools provide high-quality education for all children.

If we are to truly protect these animals, we must make the effort that it requires.<br/><br/>&quot;When a man has pity on all living creatures then only is he noble&quot;<br/>Buddha<br/><br/>Thank you and God bless you.<br/><br/>",

    "text": "Dear Assistant General Counsel Hilary Malawer,<br/><br/>All Department of Education civil rights regulations and guidance documents are important and necessary. Far from being burdensome, current civil rights rules and regulations  benefit schools and students by providing a clear framework that, when followed, allow all students an equal opportunity to learn in a safe and welcoming environment regardless of sex, race, color, national origin, disability status, English proficiency, sexual orientation, or gender identity.<br/>I urge the Department to keep in its current form 34 C.F.R. pts. 1 thru 1299 , which include regulations governing the Secretary and the offices for Civil Rights; Elementary and Secondary Education; Special Education and Rehabilitative Services; Career, Technical, and Adult Education; Post-Secondary Education; Educational Research and Improvement; and the National Council on Disability. <br/><br/>I also urge the Department to preserve all current significant guidance documents, including guidance on sexual, racial, and disability-based harassment (including guidance on sexual violence); access to athletic opportunities; gender equity in career and technical education; single-sex schools; equal access to educational resources; nondiscriminatory school discipline; racial diversity programs; the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools; restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities; and the rights of English language learners. I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place, and to continue enforcing these critical civil rights laws so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Eric Sletteland<br/>  Lawrence Township, NJ 08648",

    "text": "Food and Drug Administration HHS,<br/><br/>My mother is a doctor, my father a world renowned medical geneticist. However, inbetween colleges, I worked at a recreational cannabis store for about a year, during which medical and recreational marijuana became one in the state of Washington. If you had met and seen the patients I was so blessed to help, you would not waste your time with this silly hearing, you would make the stuff legal over night. If you have ever seen anyone with a seizure disorder or someone with MS or Huntington&#39;s and then you saw them on CBD oil, you would break down crying like I have so many times before. It is truly a miracle medicinal drug. Proven to not only be chemically non addictive but also impossible for someone to overdose from. Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m way more addicted to shopping and cheese than I ever could be to weed or CBD. It can cure many types of cancer, it can give the appetite back to a fighting cancer survivor going through chemo. It lifts the spirits of peope with severe and crippling PTSD and anxiety. <br/><br/>It gives the lives back of millions of Americans each and every day. And I haven&#39;t even gotten into it&#39;s analgesic properties which could save millions of more American lives by slowing down the overdose rate from pain killers that is sweeping our nation. <br/><br/>And here&#39;s the thing, if you all don&#39;t make it legal this year or next year, you will be handing down a death sentence to thousands of Americans, but rest assured, I&#39;ll be done with law school in 5 short years and I have sworn my life to giving the American people access to CBD and Cannabis and I will have dieing 5 year old children and retired army vets (both in wheelchairs) on my side. I will be one good PR team away from forcing the US congress to finally right this wrong. And unlike most of you, I&#39;m not afraid of big pharma or will ever be in their pockets.<br/><br/>Fix it or I will.<br/><br/>-Erin",

    "text": "I am writing in support of this Citizen Petition from NJOY et. al. which requests the FDA issue final guidance to manufacturers seeking PMTA approval and that it extend the compliance deadline for submitting these applications by 24 months from the date the guidance is published.<br/><br/>If left unchanged, the FDA deeming regulations will take full effect in November of 2018 and severely impact consumer access to the diverse vapor market. Currently, there is no clear-cut path manufacturers can navigate to gain market approval. The costs associated with this process are, for the vast majority of vapor manufacturers, an insurmountable hurdle. As a result, 99% of the vapor industry will be shut down in less than two years unless compliance deadlines are extended and the application process is defined.<br/><br/>The FDA took seven years to finalize the deeming regulation that brought vapor products under the agency&#39;s authority to regulate tobacco. Yet, when the rule was finalized, manufacturers were only given two years to comply. At a minimum, the current compliance period ignores the amount of time required to perform the studies FDA has indicated it may require in order to grant market approval for a product.<br/><br/>Having a diverse range of vapor products on the market is critical in order to achieve the public health goal of helping smokers move away from smoking combusted cigarettes and toward low-risk alternatives. Several recent studies demonstrate that the variety of e-cigarette flavors and devices plays a vital role in helping people transition to a smoke-free nicotine product and improve their health. Access to a diverse market of low-risk tobacco and nicotine products must be preserved in order to maximize the public health benefit. If left unchanged, the application of existing tobacco regulations will whittle the vapor market down to only a few expensive products that will be out of reach for many smokers.<br/><br/>I urge the Commissioner to consider the full weight of this petition and accept the petitioner&#39;s request for final guidance and to extend the compliance deadline. Thank you for considering my comments on this matter.  time!",
