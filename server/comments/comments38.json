    "text": "I oppose the destruction of bats and their habitat by gas and oil companies, as is being considered by the Service. I oppose the development of a proposal for an &quot;Incidental Take Permit&quot; and advocate that an Environmental Impact Statement provide comprehensive analysis of alternative actions that will not allow the taking of bats. <br/><br/>Chesapeake, MarkWest, Williams, Anthero Resources, Ascent Resources, Southwestern, EQT, EnLink Midstream, MPLX, Marathon Petroleum, and Rice Energy are companies that routinely infringe on these species through gas and oil exploration and development activities. The continuation of their projects will result in continuing harm due to the unavoidable impacts entailed in this development, despite the promise of a Habitat Conservation Plan to be developed through the upcoming EIS process. This is especially true considering the cumulative impact of allowing this destruction over a 50 year period.<br/><br/>The Scope for the EIS must examine the impacts that accompany oil and gas development including water withdrawal and depletion, toxic waste generation and disposal, land changes that result in habitat loss and fragmentation, water contamination and air pollution, and the emission of greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change. These are known to affect the roosting and foraging ecology of bats, particularly during critical life periods (e.g., hibernation, migration, and reproduction) (Hein, C. D. 2012).  Bats are known to have low reproductive rates and respond slowly to rapid population declines (Barclay and Harder 2005).The devastation of White-nose Syndrome has resulted in a stunning decline of nearly 98% of hibernating bat populations in Pennsylvania (Turner et al. 2011). This disease and the effects of other human activities that degrade and destroy suitable habitat and resources are compounding challenges that bats must already withstand (Kunz and Parsons 2009). Bats are struggling to survive here; these takings could be the final blow for some species.<br/><br/>Bats are critical to our economy and ecology. For instance, worldwide, bats function as pollinators, seed dispersers, and biological controls for nocturnal insects (Kunz and Parsons 2009) (Jones et al. 2009). In Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, most species consume large quantities of night-flying insects, many of which are agricultural and forest pests. (Hein, C. D. 2012). Their loss will be our loss.<br/><br/>I oppose the consideration and proposal of an Incidental Take Permit for bats and oppose the consideration of the reduction of the protections now in place for bats in these locations for any period of time.  All five of these bat species are in need of more effective protections in the face of the multiple challenges they already must contend with so they may continue to be a critically beneficial part of the regional ecosystem.",

Of course, people using cell phones in public show the utmost in respect and consideration and rarely if ever annoy their fellow citizens who are attempting to have a conversation with a peer, or -image this - a moment of quite reflection.<br/><br/>Of course in flight phone calls on cell phones (wireless or otherwise) should be banned. This seems so obvious as to be beyond question let alone contemplation.<br/><br/>Please look around and notice for example, that the most popular movie theaters are banning cell phone use during the movie and removing patrons who refuse to abide by their policy. Why do you think that theaters are doing this? Because many if not most cell phone users are inconsiderate clods. <br/><br/>Do you think most people stuck in a tube at 30,000 feet with 250 other passengers, who are already too cramped and surrounded by individuals barely able to show civility, want another mode of annoyance?<br/><br/>BAN BAN BAN BAN! <br/><br/>Any questions?

Puget Sound and surrounding waters are beautiful, vibrant waterways but they are not healthy.  Both salmon and orca are indicator species (and threatened species, technically, by the numbers their numbers are so low they are endangered species) and the declining numbers of both of these species is telling us these bodies of water are not healthy.  Both of these species have several challenges and clean habitats are one of them.  Both of these species are critically important to the economy of our region whether it be sport fishing (catch and release of our endangered salmon species), whale watching, photography and tourism to name just a few economic connections.  Both of these species are culturally important - certainly to native nations but also to all people of the Puget Sound area.  These are iconic animals that do provide a spiritual, aesthetic presence to all of us and it is our responsibility to care for them by providing the healthiest environment we can.  We are stewards of this region!  If we can identify specific actions that improve the health of our bodies of water we need to step up and do this!  Dumping sewage within these waters is horrifying - the pathogens, endocrine disruptors and chemicals that are present in human waste potentially cause immeasurable damage, are persistent and not easily broken down!  Our waters are not a toilet, items are not flushed away - they remain within the sediments, water column and food web for decades.

As a number of studies have pointed out, its not the biomass that is declining, but the management of the biomass that is in need of change. From what I have read from a number of published articles on this subject, the Pacific Bluefin is being over-fished by the foreign commercial fishing vessels for exportation to foreign countries. One study suggested that almost 95% of all Pacific Bluefin caught is by the commercial fishing fleet with almost 100% of the catch going to Japan and China. It is obvious from the early closure of the commercial Pacific Bluefin fishery to the commercial fishing fleet has resulted in added presence of the species off the California coast. With the California recreational angler accounting for less than 1% of all Pacific Bluefin being caught, it is obvious that if the biomass is declining, it is a result of mismanagement of the species, and the over-fishing by the commercial fishing fleet. Punishing the recreational angler by placing the Pacific Blue on the ESA will have no positive effect until the foreign commercial fishing fleet is banned from U.S. waters.",

They move quickly because they are a highly migratory species.  Also, recreational fishermen like myself do not target them because they are notoriously difficult to get them to bite.  Fishermen joke - &quot;How do you know if it was a yellowfin or bluefin tuna?&quot;  Answer: &quot;It a bunch of them bite, they were yellowfin.  If they wouldn&#39;t bite anything, they were bluefin.&quot;  For sure it&#39;s a low retention endeavor.  They are the kind of fish that you may catch one all season, and if you do, you are pretty stoked.  Sure we all spend more money than we&#39;d like to admit on tackle, boating equipment, fuel, food, etc, but we really don&#39;t get that many.  I fear that the undue economic impact would be severe but there would be little impact on the fishery as a whole.  We take so few compared to commercial fishermen.  And if even they are banned for us, they will still be taken in large numbers by seiners in Mexico and other places.  It just makes no sense scientifically, economically, or in terms of fairness to list this species as an endangered.  Please leave this as a legal species for recreational fishing. ",

    "text": "I have been a fishspotter for the last 44 years. For the last eighteen years I have worked in Mexico and US waters for Blue Fin Tuna exclusively. As you know the last few years we have been fishing on a very strick quota. For the last two years we have filled our limit in less than three weeks each year. We have been very selective on the size of our fish. With so many year classes to choose from we stay away from any fish under 30 kilos with most of our fish ranging from 35 to 45 kilos with a few going over 60 kilos each. This year as every year I have seen several thousand tons of Blue Fin Tuna under 20 kilos which on the average will double in size for next year. Add this to the 10,000 tons of fish over 20 kilos and we have a bio mass that is growing in size not declining. I have work with NOAA on many projects in the past and have been very surprised that I have not been contacted to collaborate on the Blue Fin Tuna as I believe I can be of great help. I have a great number of pictures if any one is interested in seeing them just give me a call.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Tom Greene",

    "text": "It is hard to believe that recreational fisherman are to blame for the falling numbers in bluefin tuna. The bag count was more than cut in half as their numbers have not improved, I believe that makes a case to show that sport fisherman are not to blame, rather the commercial industry that captures entire schools in pens. The dock totals for this year, even if each fish weighed 90lbs perils in comparison to the total weight taken bumpy the commercial industry. Is the species in danger? Yes, but putting it in the endangered species list is not the answer. Tougher regulation on the commercial industry is what is needed. ",

The result of this ESA listing is important to me.<br/><br/>While the population of Pacific bluefin tuna has, in recent decades, declined to historic levels, the species is not in danger of extinction. The United States Government, NOAA, and the international organizations responsible for management of this pelagic species, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), took action several years ago to reduce fishing pressure and conserve stocks. The most recent scientific data demonstrates that these international conservation efforts to improve Pacific bluefin tuna stocks have been successful in stabilizing the global population and stocks have already begun the rebuilding process.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments.",

Those with complicated histories will take longer. It would be wise to complete a cost/benefit analysis as the exam market appears to be hovering in the $85 range which is likely lower than the VA can provide those services. A better option may be contracting preferred private CMEs at a discounted rate($55-$60?). This would potentially provide more robust coverage and lower total program costs.<br/><br/>I believe it to be an error to eliminate D.C.s from the VA protocol. I work with some large motor carriers who use multiple CMEs of various professions.

Doctors of Chiropractic are already included within the VA health system providing medically necessary services.  Currently, Veterans are paying for a CDL medical certification outside the VA for By QUALIFIED AND CERTIFIED CHIROPRACTORS FOR CDL Medical Certifications. <br/><br/>2. Doctors of Chiropractic are qualified and authorized to perform CDL physicals as Certified Medical Examiners (FMCSA) in the National Registry in all 50 States by federal statute, 49 CFR 390.103(a)(1).<br/><br/>3. Veterans should have the ability to choose a Doctor of Chiropractic as their Certified Medical Examiner both within the VA and when using a VA vendor.<br/><br/>4. Using Doctors of Chiropractic that are VA vendors lowers the costs as they generally charge less than MDs or DOs, and are more willing to accept a lower reimbursement if applicable. <br/>(Consider providing information about your pricing compared to your competitors)<br/><br/>5. With the VA currently struggling to provide timely services to veterans, it is illogical to reduce the number of providers that can perform the CDL physical.  It&#39;s not in the best interest of the VA or the American Veterans to exclude a healthcare provider who is already qualified and certified to perform the same service, faster and cheaper than other healthcare providers. <br/><br/>The decision to include Doctors of Chiropractic who are already in the Veterans Administration or through VA vendors providing necessary services the ability to perform Qualified Certifications as a FMSCA Certified Medical Examiner will reduce the cost to the VA, and reduce the wait time for these Veterans and allow them the opportunity to get jobs to improve their lives.<br/><br/>The Veterans Administration should not discriminate against Doctors of Chiropractic who already meet or exceed the criteria for Federal Certified Medical Examiners; <br/><br/>49 CFR 390.103(a)(1).<br/>&quot;Meet the professional requirements established in 49 CFR 390.103(a) (1): Medical Examiner must &quot;be licensed, certified, or registered in accordance with applicable State laws and regulations to perform physical examinations. The applicant must be an advanced practice nurse, doctor of chiropractic, doctor of medicine, doctor of osteopathy, physician assistant, or other medical professional authorized by applicable State laws and regulations to perform physical examinations.&quot;  <br/><br/>I respectively ask that you think of the many thousands of Veterans who need to work, and become medically certified for a CDL and reconsider your decision AND INCLUDE DOCTORS OF CHIROPRACTIC, for Veteran Administration Certified Medical Exams. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Charles W.

    "text": "I urge the denial of such rulemaking that would permit Voice Calls on public, commercial aircraft.<br/><br/>Reasoning:<br/>1.  Unfortunately, the general public and our society in general, has lost ALL values of courtesy and respect for fellow citizens.  This is a societal evolution driven by the availability of technology and the constant sense of urgency of personal and business matters.  This lack of courtesy and respect extends to every American venue; stores, restaurants, movie theaters, churches, libraries, grade schools, high schools, colleges, trains, buses, Congress....all environments where personal space extends magnitudes beyond that of a commercial airline seat.<br/><br/>2.  Evaluation of proposal should consider specific definition and consideration of &quot;personal space&quot;.  A commercial airline represents a certain confinement with limited &quot;protections&quot; of passenger space, comfort and environment.<br/><br/>3.  Airlines reserve the right to re-seat over-weight passengers who may encroach within the personal space of a neighboring passenger.  I believe the airline also reserves the right to remove a passenger who may exhibit an offensive odor...due to whatever factors.  So a clear precedent exists which protects passengers from &quot;severe&quot; invasion of personal space on an airline, so there is NO implied &quot;Right&quot; of a passenger to conduct themselves in a discourteous or disrespectful manner through engaging in phone conversations.<br/><br/>4.  Permitting voice calls will lead to verbal and physical altercations endangering the safe operation of the flight.  Complaints will be lodged, flight crews will be required to mediate disputes and move disruptive passengers.  The permitting of cell phone use will actually result in more protections to the disruptive passenger using a cell phone then to those passengers who are not....by the enactment of such rule-making.<br/> <br/>5.  For many years the airlines offered seat-back telephone devices for in-flight calls.  The proposal should include evaluation of use statistics from that prior technology which has been long abandoned.  I would suggest that the in-flight telephone platform was largely not cost-effective for the airline.  If the evidence supports that theory, then I would suggest that passengers have no compelling reason to use personal phones if they failed to adopt the phone technology provided by the airline.  Furthermore, if passengers rarely utilized the airline phones at $5/minute, then there is nothing more important to discuss on a personal cell phone.<br/><br/>6.  The airline provides sufficient technology for performing electronic messaging and communications through the internet.  It should be sufficient to restrict use of phones in lieu of other &quot;silent&quot; communications methods.<br/><br/>7.  The proposal suggests a &quot;notification&quot; of such provision to prospective customers.  Unless the department is going to consider a provision that passengers MUST be made available a non-cell-phone flight, with the exact same schedule and cost, then it serves no purpose whatsoever other than to remind the customer of the additional misery they will endure as a passenger.<br/><br/>8.  I would consider a cabin-separation scheme as an acceptable alternative to denial.  As with &quot;smoking sections&quot; in decades past, the airlines would be required to designate a specific seating section within the aircraft where voice calls are permitted.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments in your decision.<br/>",

These are high migratory species which makes it very difficult to conduct research as well to provide any kind of accurate information as well. As the weather and world change the life in the ocean will adapt accordingly. As an avid fisherman/spearfisherman I can say with great confidence from what I saw under water this last year off the coast of southern California that there is no shortage of bluefin tuna. The numbers were hundreds of times greater then what was seen on the surface. The size of these fish in the schools were 60-85lbs, 100-145lbs and 175-300lbs. The number of recreational fisherman that did numerous fishing trips to not even harvest one of these fish points on how recreational fishing did not impact this species. Recreational fishing regulations of 2 fish per person would not have such a tremendous impact either. Recreational fish are harvested and consumed in better fashion versus commercial. If anything commercial fishing should be regulated more if not banned. The amount of fish that goes to waste because of pro longed processing or pricing issues over comes recreational. The amount of people that are reached by fish that are harvested recreationally is just as great. Quality and consumption are higher as well. ",

Our comments and recommendations are summarized in seven points:<br/><br/>1. Broadening the use of utility benchmarking is a critical step toward increasing the quality, resilience and long-term financial and environmental sustainability of the HUD portfolios.<br/><br/>2. HUD should promote an attitude of collaborative innovation between HUD Headquarters, Field Offices and HUD owners around benchmarking.  <br/><br/>3. HUD should consider an annual requirement in locations with whole building data available from utilities.<br/><br/>4. HUD should offer additional technical assistance on data collection relative the challenge faced by housing providers.<br/><br/>5. HUD should offer additional technical assistance or incentives to ensure owners get value from benchmarking.<br/><br/>6. HUD should proactively demonstrate industry value from HUD data collection and analysis.<br/><br/>7. HUD should offer support in working with local utilities to improve data access.<br/><br/>Overall, the proposed requirements appear to be a positive step toward improving access to insights on energy and water performance for HUD and HUD owners.

Our mission is to protect, restore, and sustain Washington&#39;s environment for all. Our Puget Sound program works toward clean water and healthy habitat in the region.<br/><br/>The Washington State Department of Ecology has petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10 under Section 312(f)(3) of the Clean Water Act for a determination that adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for the waters of Puget Sound.<br/><br/>We concur with EPA&#39;s analyses and preliminary affirmative determination that sufficient facilities and capacity exist in the proposed No Discharge Zone. The ratios of both recreational and commercial vessels to available facilities are well within EPA&#39;s recommendation of one pumpout station per 300-600 boats (Clean Vessel Act: Pumpout Station and Dump Station Technical Guidelines).<br/><br/>Per the analyses by EPA and the Department of Ecology, recreational boats have at least one pumpout facility per 171 vessels. This is a highly conservative assumption based on the maximum number of boater registration records and neglecting an actual occupancy rate of 40% recommended by the Clean Vessel Act Technical Guidelines.<br/><br/>Commercial vessels have at least one pumpout per 11 vessels. Of the non-oceangoing commercial vessels, many have dedicated pumpout facilities. The remaining 600 vessels are served by two existing pumpouts and two under construction now. Commercial pumper trucks and mobile commercial pumpout barges already serve numerous commercial vessels, and represent a range of capacities to serve a variety of dock sizes and vessel drafts. Previous NDZs have not distinguished capacity for recreational and commercial vessels, nor have they considered dedicated pumpouts serving a portion of the commercial vessels. Even with these highly conservative assumptions, sufficient capacity and facilities exist to serve the remaining commercial vessels.<br/><br/>Over 90 No Discharge Zones have been designated across the United States. To date, EPA Region 10 in the Pacific Northwest is the only region in the nation that has not designated No Discharge Zones for any waters. Puget Sound, a national treasure, needs this type of protection.<br/><br/>The 5-year compliance period proposed by the Washington State Department of Ecology is longer than for any other NDZ in the country. Tugboats and other vessels have successfully retrofitted in other NDZs like the Great Lakes, and we are confident that our maritime industry will continue to steward the resource and adapt to these rules. In fact, many of them have already installed tanks and already use pumpout facilities.<br/><br/>Establishing a No Discharge Zone for the marine waters of Washington inward of a line between New Dungeness Lighthouse and the Discovery Island Lighthouse to the Canadian border is a common-sense action that reflects the value of Puget Sound and its connected waters. The region is already served by adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels.<br/><br/>If you have any questions, please contact me at mindy@wecprotects.org.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/> <br/>Mindy Roberts, Ph.D., P.E.<br/>Puget Sound Director<br/>Washington Environmental Council<br/><br/>Cc: Maia Bellon, Washington State Department of Ecology<br/>",

    "text": "Comments on FDA Draft Guidance &quot;Medical X-Ray Imaging Devices Conformance with IEC Standards&quot;, dated August 3, 2016.  <br/><br/>I have attached a more detailed statement regarding myself and my comments.<br/><br/>What I would suggest is that (1) the existing EPRC standards be changed systematically with a timetable, to ensure progress over time, and not the next change in management.   In tandem with this initiative (2) FDA should adopt industry standards, as currently proposed, under guidance.<br/> <br/>An example of a simpler EPRC standard for x-ray exposure would be worded so that &quot;radiation emitting medical devices display the radiation dose an individual patient is exposed to, with a level of precision and accuracy consistent with current industry standards&quot;.  This would be the mandatory, enforceable component. The guidance standard would be the 2nd tier more detailed, establish quantitative levels for accuracy, perhaps traceable to a national standard.  These would change and evolve over time as industry and the state of the science improved.  Consequently, the mandatory, enforceable standard, could remain unchanged over many years, while the voluntary guidance could change more frequently.  I believe this two tier approach could work.   <br/> <br/>Summarizing:<br/><br/>Mandatory versus Voluntary Standards: The former is enforceable, the latter is not.  <br/><br/>Access of IEC Standards is a serious flaw in terms of process. and represents a lack of openness and transparency of IEC standards.  They are not available!  I attempted to find copies of these standards, having actually served on IEC committees which promulgated some of these very standards, and I was not successful. The use of IEC standards which are (1) not available to the public; and (2) must be purchased for a fee is simply unacceptable. <br/><br/>In the United States we pride ourselves on our open rulemaking process, but the perception here is that the FDA is selling out to the IEC, since we cannot see that which is being adopted by reference.  I would hope the IEC would reconsider their stance, otherwise FDA should abandon using the IEC if easy access to such standards is unavailable. <br/><br/>The IEC standards development process is not open, and involves committees which consist extensively of industry representatives.  Although a few token government and other professionals may participate on these committees, the process is heavily biased towards industry, and is essentially a closed system to the public, lacking transparency. I have spoken to other colleagues who worked on IEC committees, and their opinion is consistent with mine, although a great environment for discussing technical issues, their overall objective, standardization, sometimes differed from ours in term of public safety.  My colleagues, and I, were able to recall instances in the committees or working groups when our comments or concerns were simply ignored.  Also, not every committee has representatives from FDA or professional organizations.<br/><br/>IEC standards, even after they are developed, are also not finalized using a final, open public comment period.  Although developed in a closed system, the final IEC standards are approved by a majority vote of member nations.  Each national committee gets one vote, regardless of the size of the country&#39;s population.  European nations, even if they belong to the European Union, each have one vote.  The entire U.S. national Technical Advisory Group consists of many industry representatives, and has only one vote cast by the chairperson.<br/><br/>The IEC standards do not consider safety and efficacy their primary objective.  The IEC is a voluntary industry association whose major objective is to standardize testing and to minimize variability among different standards from different organizations and nations.  Although they may consider safety as a concern, their primary objective is standardization for their industry members.<br/><br/>IEC standards lack enforcement. I must ask how FDA will enforce non-FDA standards, even if &quot;adopted&quot; as guidance.  FDA&#39;s field enforcement program requires a formal Compliance Program, tuned specifically to the mandatory regulations.  I seriously doubt FDA will enforce IEC promulgated standards, and suspect that within FDA, this real and potential conflict between compliance, the field, and headquarters has not been discussed substantively.<br/><br/>Why the IEC?  There are many other standards setting organizations, such as ISO, or the American National Standards institute, ANSI.  These should all be considered, and not limited to the IEC.<br/><br/>I believe this is an important step forward, but the balance between enforceable FDA mandatory standards, and guidance using conformance standards needs to be resolved.  <br/><br/>If there are any questions regarding this submission, please see my contact information which is on my file attachment. submission.  <br/><br/>Respectfully submitted,<br/><br/>Orhan H Suleiman, MS, PhD, FAAPM, FHPS<br/>Former Senior Science Policy Adviser (Retired, FDA) ",

I have worked in the industry for almost two years now as a booking agent for the a sportfishing landing and have seen the impact that a closure to the bluefin fishery can do to business. Recently the availability of large grade bluefin tuna has boosted our year financially from an otherwise slower year of fishing for yellowfin tuna and has really been good for the industry this past year. While the bluefin fishing has been white hot this year it is not customary for this much fishing for bluefin tuna to take place and has been an anomaly in terms of recreational harvest. Not to mention, that this closure would not limit the take of pacific bluefin south of the Mexican border, where they could very easily be more frequent next year. Just as significantly, it concerns me that there is a concurrent clause which designates crucial habitat. As a pelagic species that is very broad and wide ranging as to what exactly determines crucial habitat. Which to most fisherman, including myself, means that fishing for other species will essentially be restricted or closed completely, especially other pelagic species that frequent the same fishing grounds from year to year. Yellowfin Tuna, Dorado, Marlin, Albacore Tuna, and swordfish are just some of the species this would include.",

It doesnt even happen EVERY year. Pacific bluefin are a HIGHLY MIGRATORY species. Closing down fishing for them in U.S. water is going to have a very minimal effect on the global population.<br/><br/>Pacific bluefin are a very LOW RETENTION species. Think about how many times youve gone out this year (and years past for that matter) and seen thousands of fish, yet the boat catches single digits of them for the whole trip? Our impact on these schools is minimal (when they are even around to catch). We also reduced our limit last year from 5 to 2, so its even smaller now.<br/><br/>According to CBDs own petition, US recreational fishermen have only caught 12-809 metric tons of bluefin per year since 1990, which is less than a tenth of the total catch across the Pacific (8,000-34,000 mt annually) those same years. The vast majority of bluefin are caught by commercial purse seine and longline gears. See the second point. We already gave!

Bat populations in the northeastern part of the country have already decreased by approximately 80% since 2007 due to a fungal infection that WE accidentally introduced into the evironment. (https://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/white-nose_syndrome/). Bats are key species to ensure a healthy environment, seeing as they act as pollinators and reduce the mosquito population, i.e. preventing the spread of vector spread diseases to humans. Please, there is no need to needlessly destroy the habitat of an already threatened species in our hopeless continuation to rely on fossil fuels. ",
