    "text": "Since TRISO-X, LLC is proposing a first-of-a-kind US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Category II licensed TRISO-based fuel fabrication facility, all aspects of the facility need to be disclosed. I oppose the opening of a new nuclear fuel fabrication factory especially one that will use nearly bomb grade uranium!<br/><br/>According to the Environmental Report for the TRISO-X Fuel Fabrication Facility (September 2022), &ldquo;TRISO-X FFF manufacturing operations consist of receiving HALEU in the form of triuranium octoxide (U3O8) powder enriched to less than 20 weight percent 235U; converting the U3O8 into a uranyl nitrate solution, into gel spheres, and then into fuel kernels; and processing the fuel kernels through coating, overcoating, fuel form pressing, and high temperature carbonization. These operations are supported by shipping and receiving, laboratory, quality control, research and development, uranium recovery, and waste disposal processes.&rdquo; (Section 1.3).<br/><br/>Beginning with the High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU), at 20 weight percent 235U, this will be a totally new form of enriched uranium that is currently not produced anywhere in the U.S. From where will the HALEU be obtained? Provide background on how the HALEU is made, including its conversion ostensibly from uranium hexafluoride to triuranium octoxide powder, the source of the uranium and any environmental impacts of the production process, from mining to finished product. Will there be an alternate or backup source for HALEU? <br/><br/>How will the HALEU be shipped to and from the facility? What procedures will be in place to protect the general public during transport? What steps will be involved in handling it upon receipt? What procedures will be in place to protect workers? <br/><br/>What are the steps necessary to convert the HALEU into a uranyl nitrate solution? Into gel spheres? Into fuel kernels? What are the safety and security procedures that&rsquo;ll be in place to protect worker and possible pollution of the environment? What chemicals will be used, how will they be obtained and disposed?<br/><br/>Next, describe the various steps from a safety and security perspective in processing the fuel kernels for coating, overcoating, form pressing and high temperature carbonization. Again, what chemicals will be used and how will they be disposed? What other toxic/hazardous materials will be used in the process, how will they be handled and disposed?<br/><br/>Most importantly, how will the HALEU be handled throughout the entire process in order to prevent the possibility of criticality?<br/><br/>Continuing with HALEU, the second sentence of the NOI states: &ldquo;TRISO-X is requesting a license to possess and use special nuclear material for the manufacture of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel at a fuel fabrication facility (FFF) to be located in Oak Ridge, Roane County, Tennessee.&rdquo; (Emphasis added). The use of the word manufacture would seem to suggest TRISO-X FFF intends to up blend or down blend 235U in order to arrive at 20 weight percent 235U HALEU. Explain what is meant by &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; and whether TRISO-X FFF intends to alter the percentage of 235U in any way and if so, by how much and why.<br/><br/>A TRISO-X video indicates the TRISO fuel particles will last 60 years. Please explain why it lasts so long, what causes its degradation, the resulting waste and how it will be disposed. Will there be issues of criticality and if so, how will they be addressed? What will be the environmental impact and how will that be addressed?  How will the fuel be stored both in the short term and once it has completely degraded. What step or steps within the process pose(s) the greatest risk of contamination and how is that being mitigated?<br/><br/>As for the facility itself, what procedures/safeguards will be in place to prevent the possibility of radioactive or chemical releases into the atmosphere and/or groundwater? What safeguards will be in place to prevent the possibility of fires throughout the fabrication process? What are the safeguards against direct terrorist attacks or other possible assaults against the facility such as cyber-terrorism? Identify the stages in the process that could jeopardize human health or safety should there be a total loss of power onsite? <br/><br/>How would a serious accident be handled? Especially one with widespread offsite contamination? What is the financial ability of TRISO-X, LLC to address such a catastrophic accident? Identify the quality assurance requirements applicable to the facility, who will be responsible and how they will operate?<br/><br/>What are the various steps in the uranium recovery process? Identify all security and risk safeguards. Provide the step-by-step procedures in the waste disposal processes and all safeguards involved.<br/><br/>Will the perimeter of the facility be monitored for radioactive and chemical contamination, how often and if not, why not? Will rainwater be retained onsite and monitored for contaminants?",

Today&#39;s federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032. I also request that the BLM require a higher royalty rate in 2032 to ensure taxpayers continue receiving a fair share from the industry&#39;s development of publicly-owned resources.<br/><br/>America&#39;s public lands and waters belong to all of us and we all have an interest in using them wisely.

    "text": "Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>Dear Tracy Stone-Manning,<br/><br/>I commend the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Department of Interior, and the Biden administration for proposing long-needed updates to the oil and gas leasing on our federal public lands. Today&#39;s federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032. I also request that the BLM require a higher royalty rate in 2032 to ensure taxpayers continue receiving a fair share from the industry&#39;s development of publicly-owned resources.<br/><br/>America&#39;s public lands and waters belong to all of us and we all have an interest in using them wisely. These lands are the economic foundation for local communities, businesses, and economies across the West. Reforming the federal oil and gas leasing system is necessary to balance development and conservation responsibly and ensure that recreation resources are prioritized and maintained to meet today&#39;s needs, challenges, and opportunities.<br/><br/>We are counting on the Biden administration to listen to the public and finalize the strongest possible reforms as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr brian evangelist<br/>CA",

    "text": "Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>I appreciate the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) taking this common-sense step to implement increased bond amounts found in the Fluid Mineral Leases and Leasing Process. The new rules will likely alleviate the financial burden that has been placed on taxpayers for far too long. In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we&#39;ll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess. BLM&#39;s current rules fail to ensure that reclamation occurs in a complete way, and oil and gas companies have proven time and time again that without the proper incentive, they will abandon or sell their wells before cleaning them up.<br/><br/>For decades, the lack of sufficient reclamation bonds and oversight has left communities throughout the West to bear many impacts of oil and gas production, including many impacts that could have been avoided or mitigated. Many westerners live and often farm or ranch on land that overlies federal minerals. If they don&#39;t own the mineral rights, they often don&#39;t have any say in how oil companies use their property. When, as often happens, the companies orphan their wells or file for bankruptcy, the remaining infrastructure impedes ranching and other uses of the land. Unreclaimed wells can also leak toxic chemicals into groundwater, or damage the land. This often leads to a loss in livelihoods in the case of farmers and ranchers, or degraded health in the cases of rural communities.<br/><br/>I urge BLM to swiftly and effectively implement this common-sense rule to ensure communities like mine are protected from preventable harms from current and future oil and gas development.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr Bob Coulson<br/>CO",

In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032. I also request that the BLM require a higher royalty rate in 2032 to ensure taxpayers continue receiving a fair share from the industry&#39;s development of publicly-owned resources.<br/><br/>America&#39;s public lands and waters belong to all of us and we all have an interest in using them wisely. These lands are the economic foundation for local communities, businesses, and economies across the West. Reforming the federal oil and gas leasing system is necessary to balance development and conservation responsibly and ensure that recreation resources are prioritized and maintained to meet today&#39;s needs, challenges, and opportunities.<br/><br/>We are counting on the Biden administration to listen to the public and finalize the strongest possible reforms as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms Jayne Merkel<br/>NY",

Today&#39;s federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air.

Today&#39;s federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country.

Today&#39;s federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country.

In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we&#39;ll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess.

I support the adoption of these commonsense reforms and urge BLM to take further steps to directly curtail emissions from federal oil and gas extraction.<br/><br/>For too long, oil and gas leasing on public lands has occurred at the expense of the climate and biodiversity crises and impaired our national parks, clean air, clean water and neighboring communities.<br/><br/>I firmly support BLM establishing a directive to steer extraction away from our highest value conservation lands, including our national parks and their surrounding landscapes, our most climate resilient public lands, including those providing crucial wildlife habitat and migration corridors, and areas that are rich in sacred and sensitive cultural resources.<br/><br/>I also support BLM updating bonding requirements to fully reflect the costs of clean-up and reclamation and therefore reducing the threat of future orphan oil and gas wells. I am supportive of the various fiscal rates, fee changes, and similar provisions to ensure a fair return for taxpayers and communities.<br/><br/>Finally, I urge the BLM to take regulatory action to align leasing and permitting decisions with its very own emission reduction goals and to build off this oil and gas rule and develop a climate plan for our public lands. Our public lands should be part of the climate solution.<br/><br/>Thank you for proposing these long overdue, commonsense reforms.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr Ed Cohen<br/>AZ",

Today&#39;s federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032. I also request that the BLM require a higher royalty rate in 2032 to ensure taxpayers continue receiving a fair share from the industry&#39;s development of publicly-owned resources.<br/><br/>America&#39;s public lands and waters belong to all of us and we all have an interest in using them wisely. These lands are the economic foundation for local communities, businesses, and economies across the West. Reforming the federal oil and gas leasing system is necessary to balance development and conservation responsibly and ensure that recreation resources are prioritized and maintained to meet today&#39;s needs, challenges, and opportunities.<br/><br/>We are counting on the Biden administration to listen to the public and finalize the strongest possible reforms as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms Mary Coelho<br/>NY",

Today&#39;s federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country.

I support the adoption of these commonsense reforms and urge BLM to take further steps to directly curtail emissions from federal oil and gas extraction.<br/><br/>For too long, oil and gas leasing on public lands has occurred at the expense of the climate and biodiversity crises and impaired our national parks, clean air, clean water and neighboring communities.<br/><br/>I firmly support BLM establishing a directive to steer extraction away from our highest value conservation lands, including our national parks and their surrounding landscapes, our most climate resilient public lands, including those providing crucial wildlife habitat and migration corridors, and areas that are rich in sacred and sensitive cultural resources.<br/><br/>I also support BLM updating bonding requirements to fully reflect the costs of clean-up and reclamation and therefore reducing the threat of future orphan oil and gas wells. I am supportive of the various fiscal rates, fee changes, and similar provisions to ensure a fair return for taxpayers and communities.<br/><br/>Finally, I urge the BLM to take regulatory action to align leasing and permitting decisions with its very own emission reduction goals and to build off this oil and gas rule and develop a climate plan for our public lands. Our public lands should be part of the climate solution.<br/><br/>Thank you for proposing these long overdue, commonsense reforms.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms Susan Waterman<br/>WA",

These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country.

I support the adoption of these commonsense reforms and urge BLM to take further steps to directly curtail emissions from federal oil and gas extraction.<br/><br/>For too long, oil and gas leasing on public lands has occurred at the expense of the climate and biodiversity crises and impaired our national parks, clean air, clean water and neighboring communities.<br/><br/>I firmly support BLM establishing a directive to steer extraction away from our highest value conservation lands, including our national parks and their surrounding landscapes, our most climate resilient public lands, including those providing crucial wildlife habitat and migration corridors, and areas that are rich in sacred and sensitive cultural resources.<br/><br/>I also support BLM updating bonding requirements to fully reflect the costs of clean-up and reclamation and therefore reducing the threat of future orphan oil and gas wells. I am supportive of the various fiscal rates, fee changes, and similar provisions to ensure a fair return for taxpayers and communities.<br/><br/>Finally, I urge the BLM to take regulatory action to align leasing and permitting decisions with its very own emission reduction goals and to build off this oil and gas rule and develop a climate plan for our public lands. Our public lands should be part of the climate solution.<br/><br/>Thank you for proposing these long overdue, commonsense reforms.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr Paul Falck<br/>SC",

    "text": "Dear Bureau of Land Management,<br/><br/>I am very encouraged that BLM has requested input on how concerns about climate and greenhouse gas emissions should be addressed in the agency&rsquo;s oil and gas rule. Reducing the damaging climate impacts on our public lands by starting a process to align the federal oil and gas program with our national climate commitments should be top of mind for public land management.  The summer of 2023 has brought unprecedented heat waves and record-breaking high temperatures nationwide, as well as the deadliest U.S. wildfire in the last 100 years, in Maui, surpassing the deadly Camp wildfire in California in 2018. Climate-related disasters such as flooding, wildfires, and extreme storm events will only intensify in the decades ahead without aggressive action to curb greenhouse-gas emissions on our public lands.  <br/><br/>The proposed regulations would adopt a set of long-overdue fiscal reforms, and we recognize the importance of finalizing them in a timely manner. We urge BLM to give similar urgency to addressing climate in its management of public lands.  President Biden has committed to slashing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands and waters account for nearly 25% of total U.S. carbon emissions, so limiting fossil-fuel extraction on federal lands can make a significant contribution to meeting U.S. commitments. Such action will reduce the damaging effects of climate change on public lands and vulnerable populations living on or near those lands. BLM should move aggressively to protect public lands and communities by adopting regulations that require climate protection to be part of all leasing and permitting decisions, and align its oil and gas program with national and global climate commitments. Tying leasing decisions to this pledge could help prevent future approval of megaprojects such as ConocoPhillip&#39;s Willow project in Alaska. <br/><br/>We are currently living with the consequences of fossil-first policies. The time to change course is now.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Elizabeth Franklin<br/>4140 Fair Oaks Blvd  Sacramento, CA 95864-7252",

    "text": "It is high time the BLM updated its rules to require oil and gas companies to be accountable for the damages they cause.<br/><br/>The proposed regulations for the Oil and Gas Leasing Program are long overdue reforms that will protect communities. Oil and gas companies have received huge giveaways at the expense of taxpayers for far too long in the form of outdated royalty rates, bonding rules, and leasing practices. Because of these low rates, oil and gas companies abuse public lands and walk away from wells, burdening frontline communities. I urge you to finalize and implement this rule package. <br/><br/>While oil and gas companies profit, our communities are paying the price. Climate change is here, right now, all across the country: just this summer we&#39;ve suffered through catastrophic fires in Hawai&#39;i, devastating flooding in New York and Vermont, extreme temperatures in Phoenix, and polluted air from Canadian wildfires in Detroit and Boston. If we want to fix this, first we have to stop drilling for oil and gas on public lands.<br/><br/>The regulations as proposed provide some protection for taxpayers and assist communities near oil and gas development, but they do nothing to address the existential threat of our time. In order to achieve our climate goals, prevent catastrophic warming, and ensure protections for all of the resources offered by our public lands, the BLM must move aggressively to curb emissions. The oil and gas program must align with President Biden&#39;s climate goals and commitments.

In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032. I also request that the BLM require a higher royalty rate in 2032 to ensure taxpayers continue receiving a fair share from the industry&#39;s development of publicly-owned resources.<br/><br/>America&#39;s public lands and waters belong to all of us and we all have an interest in using them wisely.

    "text": "Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>I appreciate the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) taking this common-sense step to implement increased bond amounts found in the Fluid Mineral Leases and Leasing Process. The new rules will likely alleviate the financial burden that has been placed on taxpayers for far too long. In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we&#39;ll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess. BLM&#39;s current rules fail to ensure that reclamation occurs in a complete way, and oil and gas companies have proven time and time again that without the proper incentive, they will abandon or sell their wells before cleaning them up.<br/><br/>For decades, the lack of sufficient reclamation bonds and oversight has left communities throughout the West to bear many impacts of oil and gas production, including many impacts that could have been avoided or mitigated. Many westerners live and often farm or ranch on land that overlies federal minerals. If they don&#39;t own the mineral rights, they often don&#39;t have any say in how oil companies use their property. When, as often happens, the companies orphan their wells or file for bankruptcy, the remaining infrastructure impedes ranching and other uses of the land. Unreclaimed wells can also leak toxic chemicals into groundwater, or damage the land. This often leads to a loss in livelihoods in the case of farmers and ranchers, or degraded health in the cases of rural communities.<br/><br/>I urge BLM to swiftly and effectively implement this common-sense rule to ensure communities like mine are protected from preventable harms from current and future oil and gas development.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr Dirk Hall<br/>CO",

Today&#39;s federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032.

    "text": "Dear Bureau of Land Management,<br/><br/>I am very encouraged that BLM has requested input on how concerns about climate and greenhouse gas emissions should be addressed in the agency&rsquo;s oil and gas rule. Reducing the damaging climate impacts on our public lands by starting a process to align the federal oil and gas program with our national climate commitments should be top of mind for public land management.  The summer of 2023 has brought unprecedented heat waves and record-breaking high temperatures nationwide, as well as the deadliest U.S. wildfire in the last 100 years, in Maui, surpassing the deadly Camp wildfire in California in 2018. Climate-related disasters such as flooding, wildfires, and extreme storm events will only intensify in the decades ahead without aggressive action to curb greenhouse-gas emissions on our public lands.  <br/><br/>The proposed regulations would adopt a set of long-overdue fiscal reforms, and we recognize the importance of finalizing them in a timely manner. We urge BLM to give similar urgency to addressing climate in its management of public lands.  President Biden has committed to slashing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands and waters account for nearly 25% of total U.S. carbon emissions, so limiting fossil-fuel extraction on federal lands can make a significant contribution to meeting U.S. commitments. Such action will reduce the damaging effects of climate change on public lands and vulnerable populations living on or near those lands. BLM should move aggressively to protect public lands and communities by adopting regulations that require climate protection to be part of all leasing and permitting decisions, and align its oil and gas program with national and global climate commitments. Tying leasing decisions to this pledge could help prevent future approval of megaprojects such as ConocoPhillip&#39;s Willow project in Alaska. <br/><br/>We are currently living with the consequences of fossil-first policies. The time to change course is now.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Tracy Gourville<br/>7931 Reunion Rd  Wilmington, NC 28411-9266",

I support the adoption of these commonsense reforms and urge BLM to take further steps to directly curtail emissions from federal oil and gas extraction.<br/><br/>For too long, oil and gas leasing on public lands has occurred at the expense of the climate and biodiversity crises and impaired our national parks, clean air, clean water and neighboring communities.<br/><br/>I firmly support BLM establishing a directive to steer extraction away from our highest value conservation lands, including our national parks and their surrounding landscapes, our most climate resilient public lands, including those providing crucial wildlife habitat and migration corridors, and areas that are rich in sacred and sensitive cultural resources.<br/><br/>I also support BLM updating bonding requirements to fully reflect the costs of clean-up and reclamation and therefore reducing the threat of future orphan oil and gas wells. I am supportive of the various fiscal rates, fee changes, and similar provisions to ensure a fair return for taxpayers and communities.<br/><br/>Finally, I urge the BLM to take regulatory action to align leasing and permitting decisions with its very own emission reduction goals and to build off this oil and gas rule and develop a climate plan for our public lands. Our public lands should be part of the climate solution.<br/><br/>Thank you for proposing these long overdue, commonsense reforms.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr L Scott Kanter<br/>IL",

Among other changes, the final rule implements provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) pertaining to royalty rates, rentals, and minimum bids; updates the bonding requirements for leasing, development, and production; and revises some operating requirements. The final rule will improve the BLM\u2019s leasing process by ensuring proper stewardship of public lands and resources."

    "text": "Dear Bureau of Land Management,<br/><br/>I am very encouraged that BLM has requested input on how concerns about climate and greenhouse gas emissions should be addressed in the agency&rsquo;s oil and gas rule. Reducing the damaging climate impacts on our public lands by starting a process to align the federal oil and gas program with our national climate commitments should be top of mind for public land management.  The summer of 2023 has brought unprecedented heat waves and record-breaking high temperatures nationwide, as well as the deadliest U.S. wildfire in the last 100 years, in Maui, surpassing the deadly Camp wildfire in California in 2018. Climate-related disasters such as flooding, wildfires, and extreme storm events will only intensify in the decades ahead without aggressive action to curb greenhouse-gas emissions on our public lands.  <br/><br/>The proposed regulations would adopt a set of long-overdue fiscal reforms, and we recognize the importance of finalizing them in a timely manner. We urge BLM to give similar urgency to addressing climate in its management of public lands.  President Biden has committed to slashing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands and waters account for nearly 25% of total U.S. carbon emissions, so limiting fossil-fuel extraction on federal lands can make a significant contribution to meeting U.S. commitments. Such action will reduce the damaging effects of climate change on public lands and vulnerable populations living on or near those lands. BLM should move aggressively to protect public lands and communities by adopting regulations that require climate protection to be part of all leasing and permitting decisions, and align its oil and gas program with national and global climate commitments. Tying leasing decisions to this pledge could help prevent future approval of megaprojects such as ConocoPhillip&#39;s Willow project in Alaska. <br/><br/>We are currently living with the consequences of fossil-first policies. The time to change course is now.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ellen Hogarty<br/>1710 Dollar Lake Dr  Kent, OH 44240-6361",

Today&#39;s federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032.

Today&#39;s federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032. I also request that the BLM require a higher royalty rate in 2032 to ensure taxpayers continue receiving a fair share from the industry&#39;s development of publicly-owned resources.<br/><br/>America&#39;s public lands and waters belong to all of us and we all have an interest in using them wisely. These lands are the economic foundation for local communities, businesses, and economies across the West.

    "text": "Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>I appreciate the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) taking this common-sense step to implement increased bond amounts found in the Fluid Mineral Leases and Leasing Process. The new rules will likely alleviate the financial burden that has been placed on taxpayers for far too long. In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we&#39;ll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess. BLM&#39;s current rules fail to ensure that reclamation occurs in a complete way, and oil and gas companies have proven time and time again that without the proper incentive, they will abandon or sell their wells before cleaning them up.<br/><br/>For decades, the lack of sufficient reclamation bonds and oversight has left communities throughout the West to bear many impacts of oil and gas production, including many impacts that could have been avoided or mitigated. Many westerners live and often farm or ranch on land that overlies federal minerals. If they don&#39;t own the mineral rights, they often don&#39;t have any say in how oil companies use their property. When, as often happens, the companies orphan their wells or file for bankruptcy, the remaining infrastructure impedes ranching and other uses of the land. Unreclaimed wells can also leak toxic chemicals into groundwater, or damage the land. This often leads to a loss in livelihoods in the case of farmers and ranchers, or degraded health in the cases of rural communities.<br/><br/>I urge BLM to swiftly and effectively implement this common-sense rule to ensure communities like mine are protected from preventable harms from current and future oil and gas development.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms Rochelle  Carothers<br/>NM",

    "text": "Since TRISO-X, LLC is proposing a first-of-a-kind US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Category II licensed TRISO-based fuel fabrication facility, all aspects of the facility need to be disclosed. I oppose the opening of a new nuclear fuel fabrication factory especially one that will use nearly bomb grade uranium!<br/><br/>According to the Environmental Report for the TRISO-X Fuel Fabrication Facility (September 2022), &ldquo;TRISO-X FFF manufacturing operations consist of receiving HALEU in the form of triuranium octoxide (U3O8) powder enriched to less than 20 weight percent 235U; converting the U3O8 into a uranyl nitrate solution, into gel spheres, and then into fuel kernels; and processing the fuel kernels through coating, overcoating, fuel form pressing, and high temperature carbonization. These operations are supported by shipping and receiving, laboratory, quality control, research and development, uranium recovery, and waste disposal processes.&rdquo; (Section 1.3).<br/><br/>Beginning with the High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU), at 20 weight percent 235U, this will be a totally new form of enriched uranium that is currently not produced anywhere in the U.S. From where will the HALEU be obtained? Provide background on how the HALEU is made, including its conversion ostensibly from uranium hexafluoride to triuranium octoxide powder, the source of the uranium and any environmental impacts of the production process, from mining to finished product. Will there be an alternate or backup source for HALEU? <br/><br/>How will the HALEU be shipped to and from the facility? What procedures will be in place to protect the general public during transport? What steps will be involved in handling it upon receipt? What procedures will be in place to protect workers? <br/><br/>What are the steps necessary to convert the HALEU into a uranyl nitrate solution? Into gel spheres? Into fuel kernels? What are the safety and security procedures that&rsquo;ll be in place to protect worker and possible pollution of the environment? What chemicals will be used, how will they be obtained and disposed?<br/><br/>Next, describe the various steps from a safety and security perspective in processing the fuel kernels for coating, overcoating, form pressing and high temperature carbonization. Again, what chemicals will be used and how will they be disposed? What other toxic/hazardous materials will be used in the process, how will they be handled and disposed?<br/><br/>Most importantly, how will the HALEU be handled throughout the entire process in order to prevent the possibility of criticality?<br/><br/>Continuing with HALEU, the second sentence of the NOI states: &ldquo;TRISO-X is requesting a license to possess and use special nuclear material for the manufacture of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel at a fuel fabrication facility (FFF) to be located in Oak Ridge, Roane County, Tennessee.&rdquo; (Emphasis added). The use of the word manufacture would seem to suggest TRISO-X FFF intends to up blend or down blend 235U in order to arrive at 20 weight percent 235U HALEU. Explain what is meant by &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; and whether TRISO-X FFF intends to alter the percentage of 235U in any way and if so, by how much and why.<br/><br/>A TRISO-X video indicates the TRISO fuel particles will last 60 years. Please explain why it lasts so long, what causes its degradation, the resulting waste and how it will be disposed. Will there be issues of criticality and if so, how will they be addressed? What will be the environmental impact and how will that be addressed?  How will the fuel be stored both in the short term and once it has completely degraded. What step or steps within the process pose(s) the greatest risk of contamination and how is that being mitigated?<br/><br/>As for the facility itself, what procedures/safeguards will be in place to prevent the possibility of radioactive or chemical releases into the atmosphere and/or groundwater? What safeguards will be in place to prevent the possibility of fires throughout the fabrication process? What are the safeguards against direct terrorist attacks or other possible assaults against the facility such as cyber-terrorism? Identify the stages in the process that could jeopardize human health or safety should there be a total loss of power onsite? <br/><br/>How would a serious accident be handled? Especially one with widespread offsite contamination? What is the financial ability of TRISO-X, LLC to address such a catastrophic accident? Identify the quality assurance requirements applicable to the facility, who will be responsible and how they will operate?<br/><br/>What are the various steps in the uranium recovery process? Identify all security and risk safeguards. Provide the step-by-step procedures in the waste disposal processes and all safeguards involved.<br/><br/>Will the perimeter of the facility be monitored for radioactive and chemical contamination, how often and if not, why not? Will rainwater be retained onsite and monitored for contaminants?",

The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032. I also request that the BLM require a higher royalty rate in 2032 to ensure taxpayers continue receiving a fair share from the industry&#39;s development of publicly-owned resources.<br/><br/>America&#39;s public lands and waters belong to all of us and we all have an interest in using them wisely.

    "text": "Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>Dear Tracy Stone-Manning,<br/><br/>I commend the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Department of Interior, and the Biden administration for proposing long-needed updates to the oil and gas leasing on our federal public lands. Today&#39;s federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032. I also request that the BLM require a higher royalty rate in 2032 to ensure taxpayers continue receiving a fair share from the industry&#39;s development of publicly-owned resources.<br/><br/>America&#39;s public lands and waters belong to all of us and we all have an interest in using them wisely. These lands are the economic foundation for local communities, businesses, and economies across the West. Reforming the federal oil and gas leasing system is necessary to balance development and conservation responsibly and ensure that recreation resources are prioritized and maintained to meet today&#39;s needs, challenges, and opportunities.<br/><br/>We are counting on the Biden administration to listen to the public and finalize the strongest possible reforms as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms louise sonnelitter<br/>NY",

    "text": "Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>I appreciate the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) taking this common-sense step to implement increased bond amounts found in the Fluid Mineral Leases and Leasing Process. The new rules will likely alleviate the financial burden that has been placed on taxpayers for far too long. In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we&#39;ll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess. BLM&#39;s current rules fail to ensure that reclamation occurs in a complete way, and oil and gas companies have proven time and time again that without the proper incentive, they will abandon or sell their wells before cleaning them up.<br/><br/>For decades, the lack of sufficient reclamation bonds and oversight has left communities throughout the West to bear many impacts of oil and gas production, including many impacts that could have been avoided or mitigated. Many westerners live and often farm or ranch on land that overlies federal minerals. If they don&#39;t own the mineral rights, they often don&#39;t have any say in how oil companies use their property. When, as often happens, the companies orphan their wells or file for bankruptcy, the remaining infrastructure impedes ranching and other uses of the land. Unreclaimed wells can also leak toxic chemicals into groundwater, or damage the land. This often leads to a loss in livelihoods in the case of farmers and ranchers, or degraded health in the cases of rural communities.<br/><br/>I urge BLM to swiftly and effectively implement this common-sense rule to ensure communities like mine are protected from preventable harms from current and future oil and gas development.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>mr Thurston Ford<br/>CO",

The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country.

    "text": "Dear Bureau of Land Management,<br/><br/>I am very encouraged that BLM has requested input on how concerns about climate and greenhouse gas emissions should be addressed in the agency&rsquo;s oil and gas rule. Reducing the damaging climate impacts on our public lands by starting a process to align the federal oil and gas program with our national climate commitments should be top of mind for public land management.  The summer of 2023 has brought unprecedented heat waves and record-breaking high temperatures nationwide, as well as the deadliest U.S. wildfire in the last 100 years, in Maui, surpassing the deadly Camp wildfire in California in 2018. Climate-related disasters such as flooding, wildfires, and extreme storm events will only intensify in the decades ahead without aggressive action to curb greenhouse-gas emissions on our public lands.  <br/><br/>The proposed regulations would adopt a set of long-overdue fiscal reforms, and we recognize the importance of finalizing them in a timely manner. We urge BLM to give similar urgency to addressing climate in its management of public lands.  President Biden has committed to slashing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands and waters account for nearly 25% of total U.S. carbon emissions, so limiting fossil-fuel extraction on federal lands can make a significant contribution to meeting U.S. commitments. Such action will reduce the damaging effects of climate change on public lands and vulnerable populations living on or near those lands. BLM should move aggressively to protect public lands and communities by adopting regulations that require climate protection to be part of all leasing and permitting decisions, and align its oil and gas program with national and global climate commitments. Tying leasing decisions to this pledge could help prevent future approval of megaprojects such as ConocoPhillip&#39;s Willow project in Alaska. <br/><br/>We are currently living with the consequences of fossil-first policies. The time to change course is now.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Juanita Mangan-Van Ham<br/>3512 Bentley Dr  Spring Valley, CA 91977-2001",

The summer of 2023 has brought unprecedented heat waves and record-breaking high temperatures nationwide, as well as the deadliest U.S. wildfire in the last 100 years, in Maui, surpassing the deadly Camp wildfire in California in 2018. Climate-related disasters such as flooding, wildfires, and extreme storm events will only intensify in the decades ahead without aggressive action to curb greenhouse-gas emissions on our public lands.  <br/><br/>The proposed regulations would adopt a set of long-overdue fiscal reforms, and we recognize the importance of finalizing them in a timely manner. We urge BLM to give similar urgency to addressing climate in its management of public lands.  President Biden has committed to slashing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands and waters account for nearly 25% of total U.S. carbon emissions, so limiting fossil-fuel extraction on federal lands can make a significant contribution to meeting U.S. commitments. Such action will reduce the damaging effects of climate change on public lands and vulnerable populations living on or near those lands. BLM should move aggressively to protect public lands and communities by adopting regulations that require climate protection to be part of all leasing and permitting decisions, and align its oil and gas program with national and global climate commitments. Tying leasing decisions to this pledge could help prevent future approval of megaprojects such as ConocoPhillip&#39;s Willow project in Alaska. <br/><br/>We are currently living with the consequences of fossil-first policies. The time to change course is now.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Melanie Goldman<br/>31078 Mesa Crest Rd  Valley Center, CA 92082-5006",

The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country.

    "text": "Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>I appreciate the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) taking this common-sense step to implement increased bond amounts found in the Fluid Mineral Leases and Leasing Process. The new rules will likely alleviate the financial burden that has been placed on taxpayers for far too long. In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we&#39;ll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess. BLM&#39;s current rules fail to ensure that reclamation occurs in a complete way, and oil and gas companies have proven time and time again that without the proper incentive, they will abandon or sell their wells before cleaning them up.<br/><br/>For decades, the lack of sufficient reclamation bonds and oversight has left communities throughout the West to bear many impacts of oil and gas production, including many impacts that could have been avoided or mitigated. Many westerners live and often farm or ranch on land that overlies federal minerals. If they don&#39;t own the mineral rights, they often don&#39;t have any say in how oil companies use their property. When, as often happens, the companies orphan their wells or file for bankruptcy, the remaining infrastructure impedes ranching and other uses of the land. Unreclaimed wells can also leak toxic chemicals into groundwater, or damage the land. This often leads to a loss in livelihoods in the case of farmers and ranchers, or degraded health in the cases of rural communities.<br/><br/>I urge BLM to swiftly and effectively implement this common-sense rule to ensure communities like mine are protected from preventable harms from current and future oil and gas development.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>ms HM Johnston<br/>ND",

    "text": "Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>I appreciate the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) taking this common-sense step to implement increased bond amounts found in the Fluid Mineral Leases and Leasing Process. The new rules will likely alleviate the financial burden that has been placed on taxpayers for far too long. In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we&#39;ll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess. BLM&#39;s current rules fail to ensure that reclamation occurs in a complete way, and oil and gas companies have proven time and time again that without the proper incentive, they will abandon or sell their wells before cleaning them up.<br/><br/>For decades, the lack of sufficient reclamation bonds and oversight has left communities throughout the West to bear many impacts of oil and gas production, including many impacts that could have been avoided or mitigated. Many westerners live and often farm or ranch on land that overlies federal minerals. If they don&#39;t own the mineral rights, they often don&#39;t have any say in how oil companies use their property. When, as often happens, the companies orphan their wells or file for bankruptcy, the remaining infrastructure impedes ranching and other uses of the land. Unreclaimed wells can also leak toxic chemicals into groundwater, or damage the land. This often leads to a loss in livelihoods in the case of farmers and ranchers, or degraded health in the cases of rural communities.<br/><br/>I urge BLM to swiftly and effectively implement this common-sense rule to ensure communities like mine are protected from preventable harms from current and future oil and gas development.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms diane marie holguin brooks<br/>UT",

    "text": "Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>I appreciate the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) taking this common-sense step to implement increased bond amounts found in the Fluid Mineral Leases and Leasing Process. The new rules will likely alleviate the financial burden that has been placed on taxpayers for far too long. In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we&#39;ll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess. BLM&#39;s current rules fail to ensure that reclamation occurs in a complete way, and oil and gas companies have proven time and time again that without the proper incentive, they will abandon or sell their wells before cleaning them up.<br/><br/>For decades, the lack of sufficient reclamation bonds and oversight has left communities throughout the West to bear many impacts of oil and gas production, including many impacts that could have been avoided or mitigated. Many westerners live and often farm or ranch on land that overlies federal minerals. If they don&#39;t own the mineral rights, they often don&#39;t have any say in how oil companies use their property. When, as often happens, the companies orphan their wells or file for bankruptcy, the remaining infrastructure impedes ranching and other uses of the land. Unreclaimed wells can also leak toxic chemicals into groundwater, or damage the land. This often leads to a loss in livelihoods in the case of farmers and ranchers, or degraded health in the cases of rural communities.<br/><br/>I urge BLM to swiftly and effectively implement this common-sense rule to ensure communities like mine are protected from preventable harms from current and future oil and gas development.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms Alicia  Bolchunos<br/>CO",

Today&#39;s federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule&#39;s &amp;quot;leasing criteria&amp;quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &amp;quot;speculative leasing.&amp;quot; Our country&#39;s current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032. I also request that the BLM require a higher royalty rate in 2032 to ensure taxpayers continue receiving a fair share from the industry&#39;s development of publicly-owned resources.<br/><br/>America&#39;s public lands and waters belong to all of us and we all have an interest in using them wisely. These lands are the economic foundation for local communities, businesses, and economies across the West. Reforming the federal oil and gas leasing system is necessary to balance development and conservation responsibly and ensure that recreation resources are prioritized and maintained to meet today&#39;s needs, challenges, and opportunities.<br/><br/>We are counting on the Biden administration to listen to the public and finalize the strongest possible reforms as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms Colette  Froneberger<br/>NC",

Reducing the damaging climate impacts on our public lands by starting a process to align the federal oil and gas program with our national climate commitments should be top of mind for public land management.  The summer of 2023 has brought unprecedented heat waves and record-breaking high temperatures nationwide, as well as the deadliest U.S. wildfire in the last 100 years, in Maui, surpassing the deadly Camp wildfire in California in 2018. Climate-related disasters such as flooding, wildfires, and extreme storm events will only intensify in the decades ahead without aggressive action to curb greenhouse-gas emissions on our public lands.  <br/><br/>The proposed regulations would adopt a set of long-overdue fiscal reforms, and we recognize the importance of finalizing them in a timely manner. We urge BLM to give similar urgency to addressing climate in its management of public lands.  President Biden has committed to slashing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

    "text": "Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>I appreciate the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) taking this common-sense step to implement increased bond amounts found in the Fluid Mineral Leases and Leasing Process. The new rules will likely alleviate the financial burden that has been placed on taxpayers for far too long. In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we&#39;ll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess. BLM&#39;s current rules fail to ensure that reclamation occurs in a complete way, and oil and gas companies have proven time and time again that without the proper incentive, they will abandon or sell their wells before cleaning them up.<br/><br/>For decades, the lack of sufficient reclamation bonds and oversight has left communities throughout the West to bear many impacts of oil and gas production, including many impacts that could have been avoided or mitigated. Many westerners live and often farm or ranch on land that overlies federal minerals. If they don&#39;t own the mineral rights, they often don&#39;t have any say in how oil companies use their property. When, as often happens, the companies orphan their wells or file for bankruptcy, the remaining infrastructure impedes ranching and other uses of the land. Unreclaimed wells can also leak toxic chemicals into groundwater, or damage the land. This often leads to a loss in livelihoods in the case of farmers and ranchers, or degraded health in the cases of rural communities.<br/><br/>I urge BLM to swiftly and effectively implement this common-sense rule to ensure communities like mine are protected from preventable harms from current and future oil and gas development.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>ms Jaune Smith<br/>NM",

The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM&#39;s new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule&#39;s implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032. I also request that the BLM require a higher royalty rate in 2032 to ensure taxpayers continue receiving a fair share from the industry&#39;s development of publicly-owned resources.<br/><br/>America&#39;s public lands and waters belong to all of us and we all have an interest in using them wisely. These lands are the economic foundation for local communities, businesses, and economies across the West. Reforming the federal oil and gas leasing system is necessary to balance development and conservation responsibly and ensure that recreation resources are prioritized and maintained to meet today&#39;s needs, challenges, and opportunities.<br/><br/>We are counting on the Biden administration to listen to the public and finalize the strongest possible reforms as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>ms Jaune Smith<br/>NM",

Among other changes, the final rule implements provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) pertaining to royalty rates, rentals, and minimum bids; updates the bonding requirements for leasing, development, and production; and revises some operating requirements. The final rule will improve the BLM\u2019s leasing process by ensuring proper stewardship of public lands and resources."

    "text": "Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on BLM&#39;s proposed oil and gas reforms. I support the adoption of these commonsense reforms and urge BLM to take further steps to directly curtail emissions from federal oil and gas extraction.<br/><br/>For too long, oil and gas leasing on public lands has occurred at the expense of the climate and biodiversity crises and impaired our national parks, clean air, clean water and neighboring communities.<br/><br/>I firmly support BLM establishing a directive to steer extraction away from our highest value conservation lands, including our national parks and their surrounding landscapes, our most climate resilient public lands, including those providing crucial wildlife habitat and migration corridors, and areas that are rich in sacred and sensitive cultural resources.<br/><br/>I also support BLM updating bonding requirements to fully reflect the costs of clean-up and reclamation and therefore reducing the threat of future orphan oil and gas wells. I am supportive of the various fiscal rates, fee changes, and similar provisions to ensure a fair return for taxpayers and communities.<br/><br/>Finally, I urge the BLM to take regulatory action to align leasing and permitting decisions with its very own emission reduction goals and to build off this oil and gas rule and develop a climate plan for our public lands. Our public lands should be part of the climate solution.<br/><br/>Thank you for proposing these long overdue, commonsense reforms.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms Johnna Medranos<br/>TX",

    "text": "Dear Bureau of Land Management,<br/><br/>I am very encouraged that BLM has requested input on how concerns about climate and greenhouse gas emissions should be addressed in the agency&rsquo;s oil and gas rule. Reducing the damaging climate impacts on our public lands by starting a process to align the federal oil and gas program with our national climate commitments should be top of mind for public land management.  The summer of 2023 has brought unprecedented heat waves and record-breaking high temperatures nationwide, as well as the deadliest U.S. wildfire in the last 100 years, in Maui, surpassing the deadly Camp wildfire in California in 2018. Climate-related disasters such as flooding, wildfires, and extreme storm events will only intensify in the decades ahead without aggressive action to curb greenhouse-gas emissions on our public lands.  <br/><br/>The proposed regulations would adopt a set of long-overdue fiscal reforms, and we recognize the importance of finalizing them in a timely manner. We urge BLM to give similar urgency to addressing climate in its management of public lands.  President Biden has committed to slashing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands and waters account for nearly 25% of total U.S. carbon emissions, so limiting fossil-fuel extraction on federal lands can make a significant contribution to meeting U.S. commitments. Such action will reduce the damaging effects of climate change on public lands and vulnerable populations living on or near those lands. BLM should move aggressively to protect public lands and communities by adopting regulations that require climate protection to be part of all leasing and permitting decisions, and align its oil and gas program with national and global climate commitments. Tying leasing decisions to this pledge could help prevent future approval of megaprojects such as ConocoPhillip&#39;s Willow project in Alaska. <br/><br/>We are currently living with the consequences of fossil-first policies. The time to change course is now.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Cece P<br/>4310 S Holden St  Seattle, WA 98118-4118",
