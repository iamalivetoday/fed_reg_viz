Kids are not seen trying to buy premium cigars or pipes and pipe tobacco. We have a long history in this country of being able to enjoy a premium cigar or a pipe of tobacco. It&#39;s a decision made by adults, and normally associated with celebration, relaxation, fellowship at cigar bars or lounges, or quiet contemplation. Please don&#39;t regulate these products as you would other tobacco products. They are as different as a glass of communion wine is with a wine cooler.",

I enjoy smoking a cigar outdoors at my home on occasion, but I never inhale the smoke.  As a former cigarette smoker who quite over 25 years ago, I like the taste of the smoke in my mouth, but it&#39;s far too strong to inhale.  But even smoking in that manner is not something I would do daily due to the lingering effects of the smoke, which leaves a taste in your mouth and a smell on your body that lasts for many hours.  But that again is a matter of personal preference.  I read that Michael Jordan, the former basketball great, smokes 6 cigars a day.  I could never do that.  But should the government prevent him from doing that if he wants to?  Of course not.  I purchase my cigars at a discount through the mail.  I hope the government doesn&#39;t come up with regulations that prevent this, or cause the price to double or triple.  Leave people alone to enjoy what they want to enjoy without government interference.  Thank you for your consideration.",

    "text": "To whom it may concern,<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to review all of our comments. I realize that this is a time consuming process, and I appreciate you spending the time to listen to input from everyone.<br/>Regarding the proposition to reclassify &quot;bump stock&quot; devices as machine guns, I respectfully disagree.  This would amount to banning a device that does nothing to change the way a firearm operates.  A semi-automatic firearm can be &quot;bump fired&quot; with or without a &quot;bump stock.&quot; The &quot;bump stock&quot; merely provides one of many methods of doing so.  I&#39;m sure you are aware that semi-automatic firearms can be &quot;bump fired&quot; in many ways (such as with a piece of string, or even just be holding the rifle in the proper manner without any extra equipment).  The act of &quot;bump firing&quot; is merely a method of rapidly depressing the trigger, and does nothing to change the functioning mechanism of the firearm. The bump stocks still require the shooter to push forward on the firearm for each successive shot to manually reset the trigger.  Without this forward pressure, the bump stock in itself will not allow a single discharge of ammunition, no matter how long the trigger is depressed. In essence, the shooter is pulling the entire firearm forward, while holding the trigger in place, rather than depressing the trigger while the firearm remains in place. Consequently, the banning of &quot;bump stocks&quot; would in no way prevent &quot;bump firing,&quot; and could lead to murky circumstances wherein shoelaces, belt loops, or even ones hand are considered bump stock devices!  Conversely, banning these devices already in production or in circulation would put an unnecessary burden on those manufacturers that have invested a great deal time and money in setting up production capability, as well as retailers and consumers that have elected to purchase these devices.<br/><br/>Regarding the terrible event in Las Vegas, It seems that, while this event was a terrible tragedy, the banning of &quot;bump stock&quot; devices would have done nothing to have affected the outcome.   Had the perpetrator been unable to procure a slide-fire bump stock, he could have &quot;bump fired&quot; his firearm in a number of other ways.  &quot;Bump firing&quot; a firearm is not an accurate firing method.  It seems that the main reason the shooter was able to inflict so much damage, was because he was shooting into a mass of thousands of people.  He did not have to be accurate to inflict damage because there were so many people in close proximity.  His firing method did not matter as much as the amount of time he was able to fire unrestricted into the crowd.  Additionally, a man as wealthy as the shooter, would have been able to procure a &quot;bump stock&quot; if he wanted to on the black market, ban or no ban, as he obviously had no regard for the law.<br/><br/>In conclusion, banning &quot;bump stocks&quot; will be ineffectual in stopping any individual from &quot;bump firing&quot; a firearm, and even if a ban would have kept the Las Vegas shooter from procurring one, it would not have prevented the damage that he inflicted on the crowd.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to review my comments, <br/>Joe Marra<br/>",

The National Firearms Act was written by law makers. How is it that no law makers will be involved while changing it to involve something that has nothing to do with the national firearm Act. I have no problem if the government wishes to regulate bump stock devices. I will gladly pay a $200 tax stamp to keep mine. However changing the definition of a word in a current law to incorporate unrelated items is dangerous. I fear that other words such as freedom of religion, speech and Press. Protection of life liberty and property. The right to bear arms. Changing the definition of some of those previous words could result in horrific. It is my suggestion that you do not change the definition of any words in any of the current laws. If you would like to regulate or ban something then it should be put through the proper process like every other law. If a current law needs to be interpreted then it should be sent to the Supreme Court for a ruling. I do not agree with changing the definition of machine gun to incorporate bump stocks.

However, this seems a case where, as a result of a single incident, one where the results even indicate that the shooter was not particularly successful in creating greater injury by his use of the device, yet another item in our society is proposed to be made illegal to own.<br/><br/>While I have no stake in bump stocks, I do have a stake in a government that, every time something doesn&#39;t go quite right, seeks to please the public with platitudes and another ban on something. There is very little attention paid to far more pervasive causes of death and sorrow in this nation, and frankly I am not sure that the needs of freedom allow that there should be substantial effort given to make everyone&#39;s life completely safe. But to make political hay out of anything that might be the most minor problem, and to try to please the majority by continually banning rights that a minority might wish to exercise, while the majority has no particular interest in that area, is the very wickedest manipulation of democracy. This is truly to use  democracy&#39;s greatest weakness in violation of its ideal purpose. It is two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.<br/><br/>Given the very low degree to which bump stocks have posed any problem to our society, despite a single, infamous event, I see the proposed ban as nothing more than a play for political popularity, and once again, a huge failure to solve any real problem.<br/><br/>If you want to deal with causes of death and destruction in our society, look to the culture, which has been horribly degraded over the last 50 years, and the media, which perpetuate, exaggerate, and glorify everything that is evil or &quot;scary.&quot; The foundations of our nation decree, most rightly, that citizens are to be the defenders of liberty and all things positive. Stop turning our nation of liberty and justice through faith and integrity into a failure, where citizens are the problem, and elitist government is the solution. Citizens need to be called back to their role as pillars of American values, the body that defines the nation and its good, and government needs to stop actively trying to usurp that role while persuading the citizens to be lazy, degenerate, and unworthy of their calling.",

The stock must be held carefully so as to not defeat this. This can be accomplished with a shoe lace between the finger and the bicep. Higher rate of fire with these devices is at the expense of accuracy(ask a combat veteran). This law will result in retroactive felons. It amounts to a &quot;taking&quot;. Not very constitutional behavior. <br/>  I also think this is a &quot;camel&#39;s nose&quot; situation. I coyote hunt with an AR-15 that has a heavy accurate barrel and a light target trigger. The fast reset and light let-off of the trigger allows a faster follow up shot as well as a more accurate 1st shot. Will it be illegal because of the &quot;increased rate of fire&quot;possible?<br/>  Finally,we are responding to one incident with these devices.

It&#39;s a human or social problem,not an item,tool,device,or whatever is used. In movies now,it seems to be popular to kill with a ball point pen.

    "text": "Banning bump stocks and changing the definition of a machine gun are two different issues in my humble opinion. The federal definition of machine gun should remain the same as it has been for years and it should not be up for redefinition. It has been vetted and is very clear as a definition. A bump stock does not meet that definition in any way and should not be considered any more a machine gun than a person&#39;s finger. Mechanically you are still pulling the trigger each time a single round has been fired. If I use the recoil of a rifle to fire the rifle faster I have not re-designed or modified the firearm at all so long we use one pull for one firing. Essentially with this type of definition change you are basically saying all semi-automatic firearms are now machine guns if you use your finger to fire them at a fast rate. Thus all of those firearms are now illegal. Please consider leaving the definitions the same for machine guns and keeping issues separate. <br/><br/>I feel the ATF clearly vetted these devices and for one lunatic to use one in a horrific crime should not make you backtrack on your clearly defined rulings. Changing definitions to make the public feel like something has been done is not how to keep the integrity of the ATF in tact. If we banned everything in this world that has been used to do harm on the first incident, then we would be in a very different world without bats, balls, knives, forks, spoons, cars, airplanes, buses, etcetera.

    "text": "This rule for Proposed Information Collection on Application for Non-immigrant Visa must be rejected in part requiring additional social media and other electronic information collection for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. No reasonable attempt has been made to justify adding social media identifiers, e-mails and other volatile data to the list of required information. There is no way for the  consular officer to verify that the information provided is complete or accurate, beyond what can be derived from other identifiers, i.e. name, DOB etc., so there is no additional value provided by attempting to collect this information. List of social media platforms is not specified in the Proposal, but it must be noted that people in different countries tend to use local social media platforms, and there is no way all those local platforms can be included in mentioned list without making it so large that it cannot be processed in reasonable time. More than that, new platforms are emerging and gaining popularity quickly and unpredictably, and proposed list is bound to become irrelevant pretty quickly.<br/><br/>2. No estimate is provided of how expensive any good faith implementation of this requirement may be. However, some estimates can be done quite easily. The number of visas issued every year is between 10 and 15 million. Even if we do not count rejected applications, this is quite a lot. Let&#39;s say average number of electronic accounts provided by an applicant is 3. Let&#39;s (very) optimistically presume that consular officer can evaluate each account in about 20 minutes. That means about 1 additional person/hour will be spent by consular service or its contractors on each application. That means additional 10 - 15 million hours at the rate of at least$40/hour, so about $500 million additional spending will be required. That is 5 times more than the total Visa Services budget allocated for 2017 budget year. So proposed regulation is expensive, even though the benefits are not even remotely clear.<br/><br/>3. Countries tend to use the principle of reciprocity in visa matters, so it is reasonable to expect that other countries will impose similar requirements on US citizens seeking entry. That means that additional burden will be placed by this ill conceived regulation on US citizens travelling abroad, again, with no clear benefits in sight. More than that, it may even hurt our security by making US citizens&#39; e-mails and other data easily identifiable and accessible for foreign actors.<br/><br/>4. People may and do consider their social media accounts and e-mails to be their private business. Initial response to media reports on this proposed regulation shows that it does not make us any friends and have the potential to reduce the number of people travelling to US on visas, thus hurting tourism, free exchange of cultures and ideas. It may offend many good people who is rightly considering it as another act in security theater of absurd, but in no way prevent &quot;bad dudes&quot; from hiding the information they do not want to disclose and entering the US. Instead of these intrusive and senseless questions, why just not add another checkbox to the form: &quot;Are you planning to hurt US citizens or interests, Yes/No&quot; and reject everyone who answers &quot;Yes&quot;? That would be much shorter, cheaper and make more sense.<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/>Proud to be an American",

I oppose any proposals that would undermine Americans basic living standards by imposing work requirements on essential federal assistance programs. <br/><br/>SNAP helps more than 42 million people in nearly 21 million households put food on the table.  In addition to fighting hunger, SNAPs structure encourages work because as earnings rise, benefits phase out gradually. Additionally, SNAP promotes employment by ensuring people have their basic needs met first. Those working and seeking work on SNAP do not need to worry about when and how they will get their next meal. Instead, they can focus their energy on finding and keeping a job. <br/> <br/>I strongly oppose any action that would expose more people to the SNAP cutoff policy. There is no justification for weakening current waiver rules and exposing more vulnerable people to the SNAP eligibility cutoff. I urge USDA to instead focus on improving SNAP and focusing on better ways to help those who struggle with food insecurity in this country.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Rabbi Rena Blumenthal",

    "text": "April 2, 2018<br/><br/>Ms. Sasha Gersten-Paal<br/>SNAP Program Development Division<br/>Food and Nutrition Service, US Department of Agriculture<br/>3101 Park Center Drive, Rm 812<br/>Alexandria, Virginia 22302<br/><br/>Dear Ms. Gersten-Paal:<br/> <br/>Arizona Community Action Association (ACAA) is a statewide organization that advocates for fair practices and policies, with the goal of stopping poverty before it starts. Our organization understands the critical role that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) plays in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community, and we pay close attention to any potential changes to SNAP. <br/><br/>SNAP helps 900,000 Arizonans put food on the table each month. If a time limit for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) to receive nutrition assistance was applied statewide (without state discretion), an estimated 25,000 low-income individuals in our state would lose their access to food and nutritionat a time when they need it most. <br/><br/>In thirteen of Arizona&#39;s fifteen counties, individuals earning minimum wage are not earning a living wage.  Even if a person works full-time at the minimum wage rate of $10.50 per hour, the cost of living is too high to afford the most basic needs, such as food, health care, and rent on a one-bedroom apartment. In Maricopa County, for example, individuals would need to earn $15.67 per hour in order to afford these basic essentials. In Coconino County, they would need to earn $17.69 per hour - a full $7.19 more than our current minimum wage. The living wage calculation is based on Fair Market Rent data from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Importantly, this calculation does not account for additional costs that many people incur, such as the cost of childcare. <br/><br/>SNAP provides working low-income individuals and families with nutritious food when they might otherwise go hungry. <br/>First and foremost, SNAP is a nutrition program. As such, it has been proven to contribute to a wide range of improved health outcomes, increased learning capacity in children, and reduced healthcare costs. In ACAA&#39;s role as Arizona&#39;s SNAP Community Outreach grantee, we see the important benefits that come from participation in SNAP. Participating in SNAP is critical to efforts to improve the diet and health of low-income households, and we urge USDA to find ways to keep this vulnerable population connected to basic food assistance.  <br/><br/>In Arizona, the unemployment rate remains high in many of our counties, especially Apache, Navajo, and Yuma. As a result, Governor Doug Ducey has kept &quot;ABAWD waivers&quot; in place in 12 of our 15 counties (meaning the time limits are not imposed in these counties). We support this decision to NOT deny someone&#39;s access to food by requiring them to find work in areas where sufficient, suitable jobs do not exist. We ask that the USDA maintain states&#39; discretion over when and where to apply for a waiver because expanding the harsh SNAP time limit for childless adults will reduce food security, shift the burden of food assistance to local charities, and undermine health in Arizona&#39;s families.<br/><br/>ACAA believes the current ABAWD waiver rules are reasonable, transparent, and manageable for states to operationalize. Any change that would restrict, impede, or add uncertainty to our state&#39;s ability to waive areas with elevated unemployment must not be pursued.<br/><br/>While we don&#39;t support harsh work requirements, as an organization focused on healthy communities, we do understand and uphold the value of work. We recognize that Arizona&#39;s Department of Economic Security (DES), which administers SNAP and SNAP E&amp;T, has seen a considerable increase in job placements and retention among SNAP participants over the past year. But we still have a long way to go before the network of providers expands and improves enough to absorb the additional caseload.<br/> <br/>The only action we encourage USDA to take with respect to this time limit rule is to propose its elimination. Restoring SNAP&#39;s ability to provide food assistance to impoverished, unemployed people would be a powerful policy improvement that would reduce food insecurity among those seeking work.<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on USDA&#39;s Advanced Notice on requirements and services for able-bodied adults without dependents. <br/>  <br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Cynthia Zwick<br/>Executive Director<br/>Arizona Community Action Association<br/>",

    "text": "At present, a legally transferable drop-in auto sear (machine gun &quot;conversion&quot;) for an AR15 pattern rifle can be had for approximately $45000 plus a $200 tax stamp. Since the proposed regulation would legally define bump stocks as machine guns, this would become the fair market value for all such devices. Should the regulation be enacted over the objections of law-abiding firearms-owning citizens, I would demand that just compensation be made to those who chose to surrender their bump stocks or other regulated devices at that fair market value.<br/><br/>Bump fire operation is not generated by any device or modification; rather, it is an intrinsic capability of most semi-automatic firearms, and can be induced in common rifles such as the AR-15 and pistols such as the 1911 with firearms directly from the factory with no modification. It was not the intent of the NFA or the GCA to affect the legal status of semi-automatic firearms.<br/><br/>Bump fire stocks do not create a machine gun since they do not change the intrinsic capability of a semi-automatic firearm to be bump fired. They merely provide more support and stability for the shooter, increasing safety and accuracy. Neither of these two purposes are within the purview of the NFA or the GCA.<br/><br/>During the original testimony on the NFA &#39;34, a Congressman asked the President of the NRA a question which essentially is about the possibility of things like bump stocks. The NRA president responded that while that would be possible, it wouldn&#39;t be as a good as a machine gun. <br/><br/>The Congress AGREED with the that response and ACCEPTED the NRA&#39;s proposed definition of a machine gun. <br/><br/>Here is the exchange:<br/><br/>&quot;Mr HILL: Suppose your definition were adopted. Would it be practicable to manufacture a gun that would be classed either as an automatic or semiautomatically operated gun even with more than one function of the trigger and still answer the purpose in a large way of a machine gun which requires only one function of the trigger.<br/><br/>Mr FREDERICK: I do not think so. For purposes of example you may look at the automatic pistol which is the standard weapon of the United States Army. That has an automatic discharge of the empty cartridge and a reloading principle which is operated by the force of the gas from the exploded cartridge. But with a single pull of the trigger only one shot is fired. You must release the trigger and pull it again for the second shot to be fired.You can keep firing that as fast as you can pull your trigger. But that is not properly a machine gun and in point of effectiveness any gun so operated will be very much less effective than one which pours out a stream of bullets with a single pull and as a perfect stream. <br/><br/>Pages 40 - 41 <br/><br/>... <br/><br/>Mr FREAR: You are a lawyer you are not a firearms manufacturer as you have said. Let us assume that we accept your proposed suggestion I suggest that we pass it and get to the other serious questions that are involved in the bill.&quot;<br/><br/>Page 42. <br/><br/>Hearings on April 16, 18, and May 14, 15 and 16, 1934, before the Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Seventy-third Congress, Second Session, on H.R. 9066<br/><br/>Congress gives the ATF/DOJ the authority to regulate firearms and they continue to have oversight into how the ATF behaves. Your legislators should know that you disagree with this rule, that the ATF is over stepping the authority that Congress gave them and Congress needs to reign them in. If Congress will allow the ATF to ignore a very simple but detailed part of the law, then Congress really serves no purpose as any government agency is free to do whatever they want.",

    "text": "The newly proposed interpretation of the definition of a machinegun (26 USC  5845(b)) to include a &quot;bump-stock&quot; device is not consistent with the obvious meaning of the definition of machinegun, as well as ATF&#39;s previous decision on &quot;bump-stock&quot; devices not meeting the definition of a machinegun.<br/><br/>The ATF FTB 2010 letter (attached) contained the following: <br/>&quot;The stock has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed. In order to use the install device, the shooter must apply constant forward pressure with the non-shooting hand and the constant rearward pressure with the shooting hand. Accordingly, we find that the &quot;bump-stock&quot; is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.&quot;<br/><br/>In order to meet the definition of machinegun, &quot;more than one shot&quot; has to be fired &quot;by a single function of the trigger&quot;.  Although the &quot;bump-stock&quot; device allows you to fire a rifle in an unconventional manner, i.e. pulling the trigger into the shooter&#39;s trigger finger versus pulling the trigger back with the trigger finger, only one shot is fired per function of the trigger.  <br/><br/>The AG&#39;s letter implies that once the initial trigger pull is completed by pulling the trigger forward into the stationary trigger finger, that the rifle will just continue to automatically fire.  This is not correct.  As specifically mentioned in the 2010 ATF FTB letter, a &quot;constant forward pressure&quot; must be applied with the non-firing hand so that the trigger can continue to be pulled, i.e. functioned, once for every single shot fired.  If the forward pressure is stopped, firing stops.  In order to classify &quot;bump-stocks&quot; as machineguns, the AG&#39;s interpretation would require that the term &quot;trigger&quot; be removed from the definition of a machinegun and replaced with &quot;fore-end&quot; or &quot;forward grip&quot; or &quot;any part of the rifle&quot;.  A trigger is a trigger, and the definition of a machinegun says function of the trigger, not &quot;fore-end&quot; or &quot;forward grip&quot; or &quot;any part of the rifle&quot;.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this new DOJ interpretation (proposed rule) stretches the definition of a machinegun too far in an attempt to encompass the function of a &quot;bump-stock&quot;.  The proposed rule fails to show that a &quot;bump-stock&quot; device is a machinegun per the definition of a machinegun, both in obvious meaning and in technical definition.<br/><br/>Not only should this proposed rule change not be implemented because it is legally incorrect, but due to the fact that it is so obviously incorrect it is sure to face legal challenges and will most likely be defeated in court.  After all, even the ATF FTB said in writing that a &quot;bump-stock&quot; device is not a machinegun.  That is an obvious waste of time, resources and tax payer money.   <br/><br/>",

    "text": "Americans are living below structurally deficient, high hazard potential dams; Americans are unaware of the risk; there is no plan in place to evacuate them to safety in the event of a failure; or there is a plan in place but they are not aware of it.  <br/>The cost of NOT repairing and building new dams could be in trillions, and a dam disaster could cost more than 100 new dams. <br/>No other infrastructure   provides so many advantages to all taxpayers for so little costs.

( helps families and business and taxpayers from damage).<br/>Approximately 28,000 dams in the U.S. More than 15,000 of these are considered high-hazard potential, meaning their failure would result in probable loss of life. To reduce the chances of a dam failing ......invest in building more ,  and repair and routine maintenance and   not regulating a ditch or swamp in middle of a field.  Better use of money is needed.  <br/>BLM reports that some states have been deficient in reporting actual work performed, and in some cases inspections have not been performed on low hazard dams. Intermediate inspections should be conducted on all types of dams.   BLM reports that many states were not able to accomplish inspections on low hazard dams due to a lack of staff but quality, experience, and training were not factors. If BLM discovered a critical finding emergency maintenance action would be taken against these states.. Actions is needed to stabilize our dams, lower and do repairs as required. USBR - USBR reports that formal inspections, referred to within USBR as comprehensive reviews (CRs), are conducted every 8 years. The CR is conducted by a team under the combined direction of the respective Regional Director and Chief of Dam Safety Office led by a senior-level technical staff specialist and includes other specialists. USBR has several types of intermediate inspections.<br/> Fema report 2016 to congress - FWS is required to formal inspection dams every 6 years for high and significant hazard dams, every 3 years for intermediate dams and an annual checklist inspection by regional dam safety officer. Low hazard dams are inspected every 6 years. <br/>FWS conducted 134 total inspections during the reporting period. FWS reports 5 reclassifications of their dams, including 3 changes for the better and 2 changes for the worse. Formal and intermediate inspections of high, significant, and low hazard dams are performed by FWS A-Econsulting firms (Gannett Fleming, URS Corp. and W.W. Wheeler). Annual checklist inspections (informal) of high and significant hazard dams are performed by the Regional Dam Safety Officers (RDSOs) each year in which there is not a formal or intermediate Fema report 2016 to congress - NPS reports that their dams are inspected every other year if there are no concerns and had 53 inspections during the reporting period. NPS conducts their own inspections. Formal inspections are done on high hazard potential dams, intermediate inspections are done on significant hazard and low hazard potential dams. <br/>Fema required to report OSMRE ensures that dam inspections are conducted and reports that frequencies of inspections are dictated by dam size and hazard classification. Dependent on criteria, MSHA also participates in dam inspections. Inspections are conducted during construction, operation, and closure. During construction, inspections are more frequent. For impoundments that fall under certain MSHA criteria, impoundments are inspected weekly or as otherwise determined by an MSHA District Manager.   <br/>MSHA regulations require quarterly inspections. <br/>OSMRE regulations also require all impoundments have an annual recertification that must be conducted by a professional engineer or, under certain circumstances, a professional land surveyor and must be certified by the professional ensuring that the impoundment has been constructed and/or maintained as designed and in accordance with the approved plan. In the last 30 years, changing values, political shifts, and economic constraints have resulted in major alterations in the Corps&#39; water resources program . <br/> Approximately 95 percent of the dams managed by USACE are more than 30 years old, and 52 percent have reached or exceeded the 50-year service lives for which they were designed.<br/>Source of income;  since 65% of all dams are private owned,  the Fines for not maintaining could be in the Billions, which in turn could pay for new dams or fix public dams.<br/>New dams would also generate new jobs for millions.

It is unclear and unsettling why the USDA is currently dismantling all of its processes/procedures that provide some level of protection to animals.  Industry-controlled third parties have no interest in protecting the safety, health and well-being of animals that are used for profit.  The prospect of the proposed USDA/APHIS change is frightening and should be considered negligent.  This is indeed an area where government oversight is necessary.  The systemic abuse of animals whether they reside in puppy mills, laboratories, or in confined animal feeding operations among other places warrants serious oversight and inspections by the Federal Government.  There is no alternative to this existing process.  The USDA should continue its efforts to protect animals through its existing inspection processes.  Americans care about this issue and it is a disgraceful and disturbing day when the U.S. Government and the USDA abandons one of its core missions solely to appease the very industries that perpetuate unrelenting harm upon animals.    <br/><br/>The APHIS should absolutely not use third-party inspection and certification programs to substitute for government inspections in any form, even as a factor in determining inspection frequency. There can be no substitution for the impartiality of government inspection; allowing industry-controlled third parties to determine USDA inspection frequency weakens the entire system. Allowing facilities to receive fewer or less rigorous APHIS inspections could enable violations of the AWA and animal suffering to go unnoticed for years.

Regulatory policy should serve the American people by staying within legal limits and administering the law with respect for due process and fair notice. It is essential to manage the costs associated with the governmental imposition of private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations.

Agencies should closely examine their use of sub-regulatory actions, such as guidance documents, enforcement manuals, interpretive rules  can serve an important role in explaining existing statutory or regulatory requirements; however, they should not be used to impose new or additional legal obligations or requirements. <br/>Take a close look at existing guidance documents to assess whether some of them should be withdrawn or modified, or whether their requirements should go through a process of notice and comment rulemaking. Clarifying existing law rather than making new law will provide greater transparency about the regulatory process and ensure that regulated entities and the public have notice and an opportunity to comment on significant changes in regulatory requirements. <br/>Agencies should administer the law found in statutes, not make new law, and they should respect the judicial role in enforcing limits on administrative power. Moreover, faithful execution of the laws requires the Administration be directly accountable for its regulatory policies and ensure that regulations and their enforcement benefit the American people. <br/>A new direction that recognizes the costs of accumulated regulatory burdens and looks for ways to reduce those burdens by modifying or eliminating regulations; revising or eliminating guidance documents; and streamlining information collections.

Machine made cigars have a totally different clientele, in many cases, only being purchased to be used for substances such as marijuana. Cigar smokers also do not smoke a premium cigar the same as a cigarette smoker would. Cigarette smokers inhale smoke into the lungs and back out causing lung cancer and emphysema. Cigar smokers inhale only as far as the mouth before exhaling the smoke. The primary factor for cigarette smokers is the addiction they experience caused by the chemical nicotine. The amount of nicotine experienced via a premium cigar is much less due to the manufacturing process of cigarettes vs. cigars. Cigar smokers also only smoke the first two thirds of a cigar which does not allow the smoker to experience the nicotine. Cigarettes also produce a much higher concentration of tar. This is due to the fact that the tobacco in cigarettes is finely chopped as opposed to cigar which are simply rolled. The cut that a smokers adds to the cigar in order to draw it is large which does not allow tar to build at the smoking end. In closing, the premium cigar industry is not in need of regulation. ",

I am writing on behalf of the cigar industry, which is currently under significant threat and in the process of undergoing new regulations by the FDA, with severe and deleterious effects. The economic burden posed by these proposed regulations would significantly hinder the ability of larger companies to compete in the US marketplace, in addition to utterly bankrupting smaller US-based companies that are unable to procure the necessary funds to adhere to the proposed regulations while sustaining their financial viability and solvency within the market. This will lead to a significant loss of both US-based jobs and economic stability of those individuals and families that rely on this industry for their livelihoods. I know of multiple, small US-based companies that have already voiced their concerns regarding these regulations and their ability to remain solvent and in business without the ability to release new cigar lines as the market fluctuates and to ensure their existing lines adhere to the proposed regulations and regulatory processes. I understand the viewpoint of the FDA in regulating the industry to avoid tobacco exposure to young children and adolescents; however, there is significant research that has, and continues to, document that most children and adolescents try smoking cigarettes during their development, and not cigars with the CDC documenting only 7% among high-school aged adolescents and 2.2% among early adolescents. There is also substantial data charting the significantly decreasing trend in the amount of children and adolescents that do try tobacco-based products, with the largest percentage of use trending toward electronic and tobacco cigarettes. Research has also documented the average age of individuals who either try their first cigar, or begin smoking cigars, are in their mid thirties. As a result of this research, I believe the proposed regulations are overbearing on the wrong tobacco market and industry. I sincerely hope the FDA will reconsider the existing proposals to ensure the cigar industry is able to continue within the US marketplace without undue and burdensome regulations that will weaken the largest companies and bankrupt the smaller boutique companies. Thank you for your time and help in this matter, I truly appreciate the opportunity to voice my concerns for the industry and hope that the FDA is able to reach a reasonable conclusion in implementing commonsense regulations that will not pose such detrimental effects on the market as they are currently posited.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Thomas J.

Bats play an important role in many environments around the world. Some plants depend partly or wholly on bats to pollinate their flowers or spread their seeds, while other bats also help control pests by eating insects.  study found that bats save farmers more than $1 billion worldwide . So why is the government give big tax dollars to the Wind turbine suppliers ??<br/>August 8 2008 - The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) announced today that it will implement a new initiative to better protect bees, BATS, birds and others that are essential to global crop production and biodiversity. N United Nations designated 2011-2012 the International Year of the Bat. Wind farms and wind turbines kill hundreds of thousands of bat per year in usa,    <br/>was designed to tackle the recent decline and, in some cases, near collapse of important pollinator populations around the world, such as honey bees. Disease, pesticides, habitat loss and the introduction of exotic species are all thought to be responsible in part.  Wind Turbines are destroying Bats. <br/>Pollinators such as bees, as well as BATS, butterflies, birds and even mosquitoes, play a vital role in food production because they transfer pollen between seed plants, affecting more than a third of the world&#39;s agricultural crops. Farmers and consumers are thus dependent on healthy pollinator populations.<br/>Under the initiative, best management practices for maintaining and protecting pollinator species will be introduced worldwide and countries and regions will be given assistance to help them protect pollinators.<br/>Recent research determined that free-tails are so effective that they save south-central Texas farmers up to $1.7 million a year in pesticide costs, the BCI reports.   Mexican free-tailed bat, common in Texas, will reach an altitude of 1,000 feet to snare crop-destroying corn earworm moths. The corn earworm moth (or more specifically, the moths&#39; larvae) cause major damage to U.S. corn crops. Researchers from Southern Illinois University (SIU) wanted to find out what happens when bats aren&#39;t allowed to feed freely on the moths, so they built large outdoor enclosures over cornfields in Southern Illinois. The enclosures were covered in nets that let insects in but kept bats out. The corn grown within the enclosures had significantly more larvae-damaged kernels - by 56 percent - and less fungal damage.  <br/>The researchers noted that bats &quot;suppress pest-associated fungal growth and mycotoxin in corn&quot; as well as increased crop yield by 1.4 percent, which adds up to a difference of more than $3 an acre. study found that bats save farmers more than $1 billion worldwide - and that&#39;s only for corn crops. The estimate also doesn&#39;t factor in other benefits that bats provide, such as a reduction in pesticide use. Study author Josiah Maine told BBC News: In 2011, University of Tennessee at Knoxville researchers also analyzed the economic importance of bats in agriculture.   <br/>",

These regulations create a heavy restriction on the freedom to patronize these small businesses across America. Premium cigar retailers are typically small family businesses selling an artisan product created by craftsman richly skilled in the art of creating premium cigars. The proposed regulations would threaten yet another rich, culturally significant tradition . People that enjoy premium cigars and cigar shops all across the country, enjoy the social aspects of meeting with friends, the camaraderie, the moments of enjoying life that we all need. Premium cigars deserve an exemption from federal regulation.<br/><br/>Additionally as a small business owner that operates a Cigar lounge, our demographic is rarely anyone under 30 years of age.  The disposable income needed to afford premium cigars does not fall i. Line with those individuals under the age of 21.  Furthermore, there is virtually no link to cancer or illnesses associated with Cigar smoking as it is a natural tobacco without the artificial, addictive ingredients associated with cigarettes.

I feel this ruling should be reconsidered as it provides no value in furthering the goal of reducing gun violence, and provides no amnesty period for law-abiding owners, like myself, who have done nothing wrong.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the ATF was correct when, in 2010, it determined that bump stocks did not convert semi-autos into fully automatic firearms. Federal law says, in part, that a machine gun is a weapon that can fire &quot;automatically more than one shot ... by a single function of the trigger.&quot; The definition includes &quot;...any part designed and intended solely and exclusively ... for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun...&quot; (26 U.S.C. 5845(b)) According to this definition, a &quot;bump stock&quot; does not fall within this definition. With a &quot;bump stock,&quot; each and every round is discharged as the result of an independent pull of the trigger.  So it is simply untrue that the &quot;bump stock&quot; assists the discharge of more than one round &quot;by a single function of the trigger&quot; -- no matter how fast the gun discharges rounds. One pull, one discharge.  This is the classic textbook definition of a SEMI-automatic firearm.<br/><br/>",

    "text": "Dear Mr. ATF<br/><br/>I am commenting to state that I do not agree with the banning of bump stocks.<br/>Firstly, your agency would redefine and broaden existing definitions and rulings to encapsulate a device already reviewed and approved by your same agency. Stated in this very document is the notion that bump-firing a weapon is a legal exercise, but a non-mechanical device that assists in that legal exercise would be outlawed.<br/><br/>It would be a &quot;slippery slope&quot; if this agency began an unconventional trend of banning non-conversion firearm accessory devices. The phrase Classification of Devices Exclusively Designed to Increase the Rate of Fire of a Semiautomatic Firearm&quot; is disconcertingly broad and non-specific to say the least, as this definition could be affixed to any number of existing apparatuses; Bump-stocks, match-triggers, &quot;High-Capacity&quot; magazines, adjustable gas or spring systems. What might even be considered the legal limit of a semi-automatic&#39;s firing rate, and by what measures do you enforce this?<br/><br/>Additionally, you would refuse to grandfather a device that, by your estimates, is numbered to be in excess of half a million already possessed by the citizenry, certainly eligible for the &quot;common use&quot; of District of Colombia v. Heller. Furthermore, the banning and destruction of bump-stalks would cost, and again by your own estimates, nearly three hundred million in tax payer dollars. <br/><br/>To summarize; bump-stocks break no laws, bear no heightened risk to public safety, and their banning would set dangerous precedence and cause huge unnecessary burden, financial and otherwise, to the tax paying citizenry. In no other light can this proposed ruling be seen as anything but reactionary political appeasement, offering up the essential liberties of others for the temporary security of the few. Tragedy is by no means justification to tread recklessly atop the bill of rights.<br/><br/>--regards <br/>A very unhappy citizen<br/>",

The agency name is &quot;Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.&quot;<br/><br/>My information is as follows:<br/><br/>Clinton D. Roberts<br/>200 Holland Drive<br/>Apartment 1018<br/>Clarksville, TN 37043<br/><br/>I am a layperson. I am not a lawyer. However, I see several issues with this proposed ban:<br/><br/>1. If we can broaden the definition of &quot;machine gun&quot; to incorporate certain devices in order for them to be banned, then the government may also unconstitutionally write laws totally banning legal firearms. What would stop the government from doing this? This is an unconstitutional overreach by the Executive Branch.<br/><br/>2. In implementing such a ban, the government is turning millions of good-natured and law-abiding citizens into felons overnight and without Due Process. The government cannot seize property without just compensation.<br/><br/>3. The method of actuating multiple shots with a single pull of the trigger, under the proposed ban, can easily be accomplished with someone&#39;s finger and a relaxed grip and support of the firearm. Further, this method is also accomplished through the use of belts, sticks, and other items that are not &quot;affixed&quot; to the firearm. This proposed regulation fails to address these issues.<br/><br/>4. In Haynes v. United States (1968), Haynes was a felon who possessed an unregistered &quot;sawed off&quot; shotgun, where the NFA required the firearm&#39;s registration. The Supreme Court ruled that Hayne&#39;s rights to not incriminate himself under the Fifth Amendment would have been violated. Thus, his conviction was reversed. This ban efficaciously turns millions of people into felons overnight. They would only have to turn in their devices if the government found them on its own. If they are found to be guilty, their convictions may expectably be overturned.<br/><br/>5. A single, illegal, and alleged use of a &quot;bump stock&quot; device, as seen with the Las Vegas Shooter, hardly meets strict scrutiny of the Courts. The government lacks evidence that bump stocks were actually used in this event; this single event by a deranged man does not make it a compelling government interest when millions of other people abide by the law; and is unconstitutional to the civil rights of millions of Americans.<br/>",

    "text": "Dear Sir or Madam:<br/>Please take into account the following concerns:<br/>1. Without express limitations on what may be reviewed, when it may be reviewed, and for what purpose it may be reviewed, the review of social media accounts unnecessarily enables a consular officer to discriminate based on expressions of First Amendment protected free speech and religion.  See e.g., Kleindienst v. Mandel. <br/>2. When the Department of State regularly engages in systematic review of fundamentally protected rights and utilizes that review to deny, refuse, revoke, or delay adjudication of a visa case, it will find itself directly adverse to finding facially legitimate and bona fide reasons for its decisions, which in turn will further limit the doctrine of consular nonreviewability and make it susceptible to a broad-based attack by &quot;dirty immigration lawyers&quot; who will pierce gaping holes in the protections currently afforded to the decisions of consular officers.<br/>3. Social media presence is inherently unreliable and prone to connections, statements, and restatements that do not adequately reflect the account holder&#39;s own expressions.  As a result, systematic review of social media accounts will result in individuals intentionally silencing their and censoring their social media presence in order to avoid adverse visa decisions.  The intelligence value of social media review will be substantially decreased due to this review.  Furthermore, the silencing of social media presence will harm the development of new democracies that are dependent on freedom of expression through social networks, will undermine international economic and business relationships, and will harm the U.S. economy by reducing the value of and presence on U.S. based social media services.<br/>4. Individuals cannot be reasonably held accountable for the variety of social media accounts they may have once held, due to the nature and fallibility of human memory which makes it unlikely for people to remember every account created.  As a result, individuals will be substantially more likely to be incidentally denied on grounds of misrepresentation through mere forgetfulness as opposed to willful actions.  <br/>5. Opponents to individuals attempting to travel to the U.S., and identity thieves could set up false social media presences with large profiles in order to intentionally undermine an individual&#39;s application for a visa.  As a result, new black markets will be created around blackmail and bribery schemes to clean and defraud individuals based on fictitious social media presence.",

Our federal government has strayed so far beyond the scope of our constitution that it is nearly unrecognizable.  I fear that restoration of our rights as citizens, and a return to a government truly limited in the scope intended by the constitution is at the very least, unlikely, and more accurately, impossible.  How anyone actually employed by our federal government could even consider this updated regulation as constitutional is beyond me. This is creating law, plain and simple.  This is not the responsibility of the executive branch.  The regulation of automatic firearms is unconstitutional.  But attempting to regulate pieces of plastic that snap on to an otherwise legal firearm is not only unconstitutional, but impossible. Since a person can accomplish the same outcome through multiple methods that do not involve an added part, this regulation will wind up having to be redefined every time someone invents a new way to pull a trigger faster.  A single person decided to use these attachments in a crime.  Had this person, who has no regard for the law, not used this attachment, and instead used aim fire, he would have killed many more people.  This is why even the US Army limited the M16 to a three round burst.  Automatic fire, even by a rifle designed for the purpose, is largely ineffective and certainly inefficient.  This proposal would make felons out of thousands of otherwise law abiding Americans.  I know that even though I do not own a bump stock, I would never destroy or surrender any of my own firearms without a hearing in a court of law.  I swore an oath as a soldier in the US Army many years ago to uphold the constitution of the United States, and to protect this country from any enemy, be they foreign or domestic.  Any law restricting my right to own or carry any type of firearm is unconstitutional, and therefor I cannot comply.  Regulations which create law in the executive branch is unconstitutional, and therefor I cannot comply.  I swore an oath, which as far as I know, does not expire.  I am bound to protect my country and my constitution.  It is truly sad that I must protect my constitution from my own government, but so be it.  I don&#39;t know how many ways that this proposal is unconstitutional, and just plain silly, but it provides no security to our citizens, and further erodes our rights.  We were meant to be a free country.  Our rights were not limited to the first ten amendments.  As any American should know, the argument against including a bill of rights to the constitution was the fear that future generations would mistakenly believe that the were our only rights.  We have reached that point, and then some. The only reason that this proposal isn&#39;t causing an uproar, is simply that nobody cares about bump stocks.  They are a silly novelty, and not a serious modification.  All the more reason why those who know better should step up and say no!  This is not right, not constitutional.  Although it may be popular today, this is the type of thing that will eventually end our republic.  That may sound alarming or extremist, but it is true.  One day, and I fear sooner rather than later, the people will tire of the trampling of our rights and the growth and power of the federal government.  I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m wasting my time writing this. But I can&#39;t just sit here and watch this country be destroyed from the inside.  All this concern about Russia, when our own government has become much more dangerous.  Oh well.  I tried. ",

Some people can shoot pump or single action shotguns quickly, and nationally recognized competitions and foundations exist to encourage that skill. These parts are simply tools, and machine guns are mechanically defined already. A high percentage of gun sales are dedicated to semi-automatic firearms, because that is what people expect from a modern firearm. Many muskets do not even classify due to style or age of weapon. Many semi-automatic weapons are included in or close to curio and relic status due to the old design features contained within. Shooting fast is what approximately any given modern firearm can due well, therefore that is what consumers, citizens, and voters desire for their personal protection and basic rights, wants, and needs. The public wants this right. Do not regulate rate of fire or other such devices that are not included in the basic mechanical definition of a fully-automatic machine gun. Keep bump stocks legal.&quot; <br/><br/>Thank you for your time. ",

    "text": "The Rule created potentially unduly burdensome requirements<br/>Given the extremely limited pollutant loadings and relative high costs, according to EPA&#39;s own analysis, these requirements appear to be ripe for substantial reduction or elimination. this entire subcategory would be excluded by rule given the de minimis amount of pollution.<br/>The Shelby Amendment Nov. 1999 , Agencies reliance on the IPCC for GHG emissions results is a VIOLATION. The Act was the culmination of a two-year effort to make federally funded research data (which are often used to develop new regulations) accessible to the public. The provision directed OMB to amend OMB Circular A-110 &quot;to require Federal awarding agencies to ensure that all data produced under an award will be made available to the public through the procedures established under the Freedom of Information Act&quot; (FOIA, codified at 5 U.S.C. 552). &quot;Shelby Amendment,&quot; As a result of the changes, in response to a covered FOIA request, agencies are required to obtain certain types of research data from grantees and provide the requester access to the data. The Act which was a two-sentence rider attached to the Treasury and Postal section of the Omnibus on solidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY1999 (Public Law 105-277, enacted on October 21, 1998). OMB&#39;s revisions to the circular took effect in November 1999. OMB views the Shelby Amendment and the IQA as compatible and mutually enforcing in that they promote public access to quality government information.<br/>Data Quality Act, ; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an international body outside the jurisdiction and oversight of the United States Congress. EPA, Interior Dept. Energy dept, Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife and Agricultural, dept of Transportation, etc. are the entity of the United States government that during last administration was seeking sweeping regulations on the basis that GHGs are increasing global temperatures. EPA&#39;s reliance on the IPCC for GHG emissions results is a VIOLATION of the Data Quality Act, (The Information Quality Act (IQA), sometimes referred to as the Data Quality Act, was enacted in December 2000 as Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-554). The act required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance to federal agencies designed to ensure the &quot;quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity&quot; of information disseminated to the public. It also required agencies to issue their own information quality guidelines, and to establish administrative mechanisms that allow affected persons to seek correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agencies that does not comply with the OMB guidance. Although some observers said the IQA would improve the quality of agency science and regulation, others viewed the act as a tool by which regulated parties could slow or even stop new health, safety, and environmental standards. Because of the scant legislative history of the IQA and its lack of detail, OMB&#39;s guidance interpreting key provisions in the act has a major effect on its implementation. In those guidelines, OMB noted that the act applies to virtually all federal agencies and established the broad scope of the guidelines by defining &quot;information&quot; as &quot;any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in any medium or form.&quot; Similarly, the guidelines define &quot;dissemination&quot; as any &quot;agency initiated or sponsored distribution of information to the public.&quot; OMB indicated that &quot;quality&quot; encompasses elements of utility, objectivity, and integrity, and said agencies can generally presume that data are &quot;objective&quot; if they have been subject to an independent peer review process.<br/>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) require agencies to analyze the economic impact of regulations to determine whether there would be a significant economic impact on small entities, the agency must conduct an initial regulatory flexibility analysis with the proposed rule and a final regulatory flexibility analysis with the final rule. The United States Code also requires special considerations if the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the OMB determines that the rule is &quot;major.<br/>The Regulatory Right-to-Know Act calls for an analysis of the effects of regulations on small business. <br/>Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA).

    "text": "This comment is to address keeping silicon-containing products for use in organic farming.  I am a research plant physiologist at the University of Toledo and have been studying the role of silicon as a plant nutrient for over a decade.  My graduate studies as well as my four-year postdoctoral research with the USDA-ARS leading to my current faculty position at UT has focused on how silicon works within a plant to alleviate stress and disease.  Researchers, in addition to myself, have known for centuries that applying silicon to plants protects them from environmental stress (such as temperature, drought and salt) and pathogen infections (including insect infestations and diseases caused by fungal, bacterial and viral attack).  We are showing that silicon enhances the plant immune system internally and without the nutrient, plants are more susceptible to stress and diseases, which negatively impacts yield and profitability.  It is my understanding that organic farming values itself on using natural products to grow plants successfully with the goals of sustainability and low environmental impact.  Silicon products, such as the potassium and calcium silicates, provide a nutrient to plants to enhance the immune system.  These products are equivalent to pesticides in reducing disease, especially that of fungal diseases like powdery and downy mildews.  The formulation of these products, in contrast to many pesticides, are similar to naturally occurring silicates in the environments, providing the end user with a safe, environmentally friendly alternative.  To remove these valuable products from organic use would be devastating to organic farming. It is my professional opinion that these silicon fertilizers/pesticides should be kept as organic options for disease control, as the nutrient, silicon, is necessary for a plant&#39;s immune system to operate efficiently.  If there are any further inquiries or more information that I can provide to assist you in your decision, please feel free to contact me.  ",
