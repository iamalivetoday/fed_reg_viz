And, while a bump stock is in operation, the trigger functions separately every time a round is discharged.<br/><br/>So these regulations are proposing a radical change -- as they effectively define a gun as a machinegun even if the trigger resets for every round that is fired, so long as the finger only pulls the trigger once.<br/><br/>While bump stock devices will now be treated as machineguns under these regulations, they also raise serious questions in regard to AR-15s and other semi-automatic rifles -- as they are now on the brink of being designated as machineguns by the next anti-gun administration.<br/><br/>In the past, one had to fundamentally change the firing mechanism of a semi-automatic firearm to convert it into a fully automatic firearm.<br/><br/>But now according to these regulations, a bump stock is a machinegun -- and it can &quot;readily restore&quot; a semi-auto into a machinegun, simply because the gun owner can effectively fire the weapon continuously with a single pull of the trigger. This would invoke the statutory definition for a rifle, which is classified as a machinegun (26 USC 5845(b)).<br/><br/>It wont matter that a gun which is being bump fired has not been fundamentally altered.  AR-15s will be on the brink of extinction once these regulations go into force.<br/><br/>These regulations dismiss Second Amendment protections, by appealing to the Heller court decision. But the Constitution trumps the Supreme Court -- so when the Second Amendment says that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, any limitation of the right for law-abiding citizens should be treated as unconstitutional.",

As the nations third-largest nonprofit health system, Colorado-based CHI operates in 18 states and comprises 100 hospitals as well as numerous other facilities and services that span the inpatient and outpatient continuum of care. As a faith-based health system, we are dedicated to improving the health and well-being of our patients and communities with a particular calling to prevent and reduce violence.<br/><br/>We all witnessed tragedy on October 1, 2017, when a gunman killed 58 people and wounded another 500 by shooting into a concert crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Casino in Las Vegas. The horror of that day can hardly be described. The semi-automatic weapons used in this attack were modified with bump stocks to mimic the killing power of a full-automatic machinegun and render the victims defenseless. Since that day, bump stocks have entered the national lexicon along with calls for increased regulation. Recreational gun enthusiasts argue that bump stock devices are simply a novelty, and manufacturers typically market them in this fashion as well. We maintain that any gun or modification device could be marketed for recreational purposes; however, Congress and ATF have identified certain weapons as far too dangerous to be considered novelty. Machine guns fall into this category, as should bump-stock-type devices that cause semi-automatic to weapons to fire like a machine gun.<br/><br/>We appreciate that ATF is reviewing the classification of bump stocks and similar conversion devices in the wake of national tragedy and public outcry. As a health system, we are concerned that bump-stock-style devices pose the same threat to public health and overall safety as machine guns. The bump stock is intended to effectively turn a semi-automatic weapon into a rapid-firing, fully-automatic machine gun weapon by modifying how the semi-automatic weapon operates. We believe ATF has a responsibility to close the loopholes in existing regulation that have allowed bump stocks and similar devices to circumvent restrictions that currently apply to the possession of fully automatic firearms as determined by the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the National Firearms Act of 1934. We strongly agree with ATF that all bump-stock-style devices should be classified as machine guns since they all convert a semiautomatic firearm into a firearm that shoots automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. <br/><br/>Recommendation: ATF should to finalize its proposal to clarify that bump fire stocks, along with other conversion devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to mimic automatic fire, qualify as machineguns under the National Firearms Act and are generally illegal to possess.<br/><br/>In future rulemaking, we ask the ATF to consider banning bump stocks entirely, as well as any similar device that alters a legal firearm into a weapon that operates with the power and devastating capabilities of a fully-automatic machine gun. We recommend that ATF revisit the existing definition of a machine gun in the National Firearms Act of 1934 to include such conversion devices among the applicable restrictions. <br/><br/>Where gun violence can be mitigated, especially in light of existing and applicable federal law and regulation, we should strive to do so. We applaud the ATF for addressing this critical issue and appreciate its thoughtful and careful consideration of this potentially volatile matter. Thank you for your consideration of our comments and recommendations. If you have any questions, please contact me at 303-298-9100, or email Laura Krausa, Director Advocacy, at laurakrausa@catholichealth.net.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/> <br/>Colleen Scanlon, RN, JD<br/>Senior Vice President and Chief Advocacy Officer<br/>",

    "text": "As an American and a Reform Jew, I am writing to express my support for the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives Bureau (ATF) proposed rule (Docket ID No. ATF 2017R-22) clarifying that bump fire stocks, along with other conversion devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to mimic automatic fire, qualify as machineguns under the National Firearms Act and are generally illegal to possess.<br/><br/>Jewish tradition emphasizes the sanctity and primary value of human life. Our tradition guides my belief that dangerous devices like bump stocks, which threaten the safety of innocent Americans, should be banned. Leviticus 19:16 commands us, Do not stand idly by while your neighbors blood is shed, a scriptural instruction which reminds us that inaction is unacceptable. Further, we are inspired by the Talmud that teaches us about our absolute obligation to prevent the loss of innocent life, noting that he who takes one life, it is as though he has destroyed the universe, and he who saves one life, it is as though he has saved the universe (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5).<br/><br/>Bump stocks and similar devices that accelerate the rate of fire of a semiautomatic firearm are extremely dangerous and pose a substantial risk to public safety. Bump stocks harness the recoil of a semiautomatic rifle to enable a shooter to fire shots much more quickly than if they were simply squeezing the trigger on a firearm not altered with a bump stock. It is with these bump stock devices that the shooter in Las Vegas was able to commit the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. With his bump stocks, the shooter was able to fire 90 shots in 10 seconds and more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition in just 11 minutes, murdering 58 people and injuring more than 500 people. These devices threaten the safety of our communities and must be regulated to help prevent further atrocities. Despite their role in converting legally purchased semiautomatic weapons into devices that operate in the same way as automatic rifles, these newer devices are not currently regulated by the ATF.<br/><br/>In the absence of immediate action by Congress, ATF should finalize its proposed rule, clarifying that conversion devices like bump fire stocks are included in the definition of machinegun under the National Firearms Act of 1934. Without regulation, these dangerous devices will continue to pose a threat to Americans nationwide.<br/>",

The gunman fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition in 11 minutes, using semi-automatic rifles modified with dangerous firearm accessories designed to dramatically accelerate the rate of gunfire, commonly known as bump fire stocks.<br/><br/>These devices are intended to circumvent the restrictions on possession of fully automatic firearms in the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the National Firearms Act of 1934 by allowing an individual to modify a semiautomatic rifle in such a manner that it operates with a similar rate of fire as a fully automatic rifle, posing a substantial risk to public safety.<br/><br/>In the absence of immediate action by Congress, I urge ATF to finalize its proposed rule clarifying that bump fire stocks, along with other conversion devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to mimic automatic fire, qualify as machine guns under the National Firearms Act.

    "text": "I am opposed to any regulation on bump stocks.<br/><br/>These proposed regulations would declare a bump stock to be a machinegun because it allows the gun to fire more than one shot by a single PULL of the trigger -- that is, by a single volitional function of the finger.<br/><br/>But federal law, at 26 U.S.C. 5845(b), defines a part as a machinegun ONLY if it is designed solely and exclusively to allow the gun to fire more than one shot ... by a single FUNCTION of the trigger.<br/><br/>To state the obvious, a finger is not the same thing as a trigger. And, while a bump stock is in operation, the trigger functions separately every time a round is discharged.<br/><br/>So these regulations are proposing a radical change -- as they effectively define a gun as a machinegun even if the trigger resets for every round that is fired, so long as the finger only pulls the trigger once.<br/><br/>While bump stock devices will now be treated as machineguns under these regulations, they also raise serious questions in regard to AR-15s and other semi-automatic rifles -- as they are now on the brink of being designated as machineguns by the next anti-gun administration.<br/><br/>In the past, one had to fundamentally change the firing mechanism of a semi-automatic firearm to convert it into a fully automatic firearm.<br/><br/>But now according to these regulations, a bump stock is a machinegun -- and it can &quot;readily restore&quot; a semi-auto into a machinegun, simply because the gun owner can effectively fire the weapon continuously with a single pull of the trigger. This would invoke the statutory definition for a rifle, which is classified as a machinegun (26 USC 5845(b)).<br/><br/>It wont matter that a gun which is being bump fired has not been fundamentally altered.  AR-15s will be on the brink of extinction once these regulations go into force.<br/><br/>These regulations dismiss Second Amendment protections, by appealing to the Heller court decision. But the Constitution trumps the Supreme Court -- so when the Second Amendment says that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, any limitation of the right for law-abiding citizens should be treated as unconstitutional.<br/><br/>The Second Amendment is not the only provision of the US Constitution these proposed regulations violate. By completely rewriting the statutory definition of &quot;machinegun&quot; found in 26 USC 5845(b) as noted above and effectively making a new law, they violate the separation of powers doctrine. Per Article I of the US Constitution, Congress not the executive branch of which BATF is part has the exclusive power to make laws. Article II of the US Constitution gives the executive branch and its agencies the power to enforce laws passed by Congress not rewrite them. These regulations represent an executive usurpation of Congress&#39;s exclusive constitutional power to make laws. <br/><br/>They also constitute an unconstitutional ex post facto law per Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 of the US Constitution. By declaring &quot;bump stocks&quot; illegal contraband with no grandfather clause and no provision for registration, BATF is essentially threatening to prosecute people for being in possession of something that was 100 percent legal at the time they bought it. That is the very definition of an ex post facto law. The government cannot criminalize an activity after the fact. <br/><br/>The absence of a grandfather clause also renders these regulations unconstitutional under multiple provisions of the 5th Amendment as well as the 4th Amendment. The 5th Amendment prohibits the taking of private property without just compensation and requiring someone to surrender his or her property (i.e. a &quot;bump stock&quot;) for destruction without compensation or face prosecution constitutes an uncompensated taking. In addition, requiring someone to surrender his or her &quot;bump stock&quot; to law enforcement requires him or her to identify himself or herself as being someone in possession of a contraband item thereby violating his or her 5th Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Last, but not least, requiring someone to surrender his or her personal property that was 100 percent legal at the time of purchase violates the 4th Amendment prohibition on unreasonable seizures. <br/><br/>In closing, I would like to reiterate my opposition to the BATF&#39;s proposed &quot;bump stock&quot; ban for the foregoing reasons. Please consider withdrawing the proposed regulations or at least amending them to include a grandfather clause. They are clearly unconstitutional as currently written and will not hold up in court. If these regulations are not withdrawn or amended, the end result will be an untold sum of taxpayer money wasted defending them in court. If bump stocks are to be banned in the interest of public safety, Congress, not the BATF or DOJ, must ban them and any ban must include a grandfather clause. Thank you for your time and consideration.   ",

    "text": "First of all, I would like to state an issue that has not been part of this discussion.  My negative experiences with animals on <br/>planes began years ago when airlines started allowing &quot;pets&quot; in the cabins.  They were not called &quot;service animals&quot; or &quot;emotionalsupport&quot; animals. I very rarely experienced, then and now, what seems to be a &quot;real&quot; service animal.  Of course, who am I to <br/>judge, since NO ONE considers my disability as being real either.  Through personal experiences with acquaintances I am well <br/>aware of the fraud surrounding this situation.  Every pet lover I knew suddenly had to see a therapist so they could get a letter <br/>allowing them to bring their pet in the cabin and even sitting in their lap.  <br/>I could write a book about all the traumatizing experiences I have had in the past 8-10 years but I will try to make this as succinct<br/>as possible.  I have written to the DOT, Jet Blue, the governor of Massachusetts, and the AAFA in the past with limited response.<br/>The DOT did send me a response in January 2014 stating that they were bound by the requirements of 14CFR Part 382. It also <br/>stated that &quot;we will be happy to make seating accommodations that meet your needs&quot;.  I&#39;m sorry to say but this was completely <br/>false.  I have been yelled at, berated, and humiliated on numerous occasions.  I will only refer to one experience because I <br/>was completely horrified.  I was traveling with my then 93 year old mother and had paid extra for seats in the front since she <br/>requires some help.  We were the first ones on the plane immediately followed by a cat that was placed very close to us.  I <br/>spoke to the flight attendant and she rudely told us that there were two seats available in the last row if we wanted to move.  <br/>Thank God my mother didn&#39;t hear her.  So the cat was more important than my elderly mother!  <br/>Flying aboard an airplane is now the most stressful experience imaginable. Even worse than the emotional ramifications<br/>is the fear of having a severe asthma attack.  When this situation began for me around 2008-2010, I had almost forgotten<br/>that I have asthma.  Once I started going to the Emergency Room after every flight I realized something was not right. I had<br/>no clue that animals were on board, however, I am like a canary in a coal mine.  Since then I am pro-active; I take lots of<br/>prednisone before, during, and after each flight as prescribed by my pulmonologist.  But this does not solve my problem.<br/>I still have symptoms long after each flight and I suffer from the long term side effects of prednisone.<br/>Airline employees will not even give me the consideration of telling me where the animals are located so that I can choose<br/>my seat accordingly.  I am now terrified of saying anything because I&#39;m tired of being abused and I am afraid of being <br/>thrown off the plane. It is very stressful, especially when my mother is with me.  I am mortified that people can treat an elderly <br/><br/>person with such disregard.<br/><br/>I had my worst asthma experience on a flight from Rome to Boston. It was terrifying since I had seven more hours trapped in a<br/>box with my worst nightmare.  I took megadoses of prednisone and Benadryl and tried to keep myself calm.  Thankfully I lived <br/>through it but was ill for over a week after the flight.  I could detail so many more experiences but I think you probably get the <br/>idea.  As I said earlier, I could write a book about all the traumatizing experiences I have had.  And you may ask, &quot;Then why do y<br/>you still fly?&quot;  Through most of these years I was flying back and forth from Florida to Boston, trying to take care of my <br/>elderly parents and working.  I still travel this route with my mother but I also retired and my life&#39;s dream has been to travel.<br/>Unfortunately it has not been as pleasant as I had hoped.<br/>I will end this here.  If I can provide anything else that can help you to see that this is a dire situation for myself and many <br/>others, I would be happy to help.   Sincerely,  Karen Cookerly<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I am providing my name reluctantly because I do fear<br/>that I will be blacklisted.  Please allow me to continue to fly.

    "text": "To whom it may concern, <br/>I do not believe that the proposed label is adequate to convey to the consumer that a product contains GMO&#39;s.<br/>Not only is the logo&#39;s informational purpose not readily apparent, it is cleverly designed to fallaciously fool the consumer into <br/>obviously perceiving the product to be natural, and or environmentally friendly., and these are both egregious claims for several reasons. <br/> <br/> The claim that a GMO product is natural is as ludicrous as saying that slaughtering animals for meat can ever be humane. <br/>It is fundamentally misleading, since genetic modification often employs advanced scientific techniques with the intent of drastically modifying <br/>the DNA of a species, typically by introducing genetic information from another species or another variety through non sexual means, such<br/>as with any or a combination of these methods&quot;:  &quot;gene gun&quot;, radiation, manipulation of germplasm etcetera. Similarly, the GMO industries such as <br/>Monsanto and Syngenta have lobbied to receive patents on their seeds, forbidding farmers to save seeds from their crops,, the very notion of which<br/> is also elementarily against nature. Angiosperms and other plants reproduce via seeds, and precluding nature from taking it&#39;s course by<br/>introducing sterility to control access to their &quot;product&quot; is a property antithetical to natural selection which favors fertility and <br/>characteristics that favor survival and reproduction. <br/><br/>   In addition, attesting that GMO&#39;s are environmentally friendly is not a transparent or accurate statement to make at this <br/>time. Genetic modification of most crops is often to make them immune to glyphosate, so that they can be liberally sprayed <br/>in order to reduce completion from undesirable wild plants, &quot;weeds.&quot; The introduction of GM corn and soy has accelerated<br/>the use of glyphosate and other herbicides in agriculture due to the convenience and also in part due to adaptation of weed<br/>species to resist glyphosate. This has created a dangerous pesticide treadmill where growers are forced to cope with more resilient<br/>nuisance plants via applying increasing levels and often more noxious herbicides to deal with the expanding threat. <br/><br/> There is research that suggests that glyphosate is a carcinogen, and it is well known since Silent Spring and other environmental <br/>advocates work has shown that many pesticides and herbicides are lipophilic and will bioaccumulate in the tissues of <br/>exposed wild animals, often reducing fertility by interfering with the male reproductive system especially, but also<br/>due to damage to bodily systems susceptible to these poisons. DDT causing California Condor eggs and other species to be brittle <br/>and thus reducing populations comes to mind as one example. It has been suggested that GM crops such as the Bt varieties reduce <br/>pesticide use, however they still foster the type of monoculture that is inherently damaging to the environment while organic crops,<br/> especially those grown on a small or local scale often employ non-chemical means of pest prevention which is better for the <br/>environment over all in most instances. Organic is never GMO, however it is unfortunate that radiation techniques to create seedless watermelon for example aren&#39;t as <br/>tenaciously regarded as &quot;GMO&quot;, even though indeed they are.<br/><br/>   All in all, a more utilitarian and less stylized label for foods containing GMO&#39;s is far more appropriate than the currently proposed label, <br/>especially in light of the fact that the science on GMO&#39;s is inconclusive and there are deleterious effects linked to adopting GMO&#39;s such as increased use of herbicides, this is scientific fact. If the organization responsible for determining the means by <br/>which a consumer is notified of this critical issue champions the evidence, and has integrity than it will suggest an image that is <br/>at the very least neutral if not accurately representative of the data on the health effects of GMO consumption or the lack thereof.<br/>  <br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>A Concerned Citizen",

Additionally, millions of Americans who live in rural areas may not have reliable cellphone service that would allow them to send or receive text messages. <br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The law clearly directs the USDA secretary to provide additional and comparable options so that consumers who dont have smartphones or live in parts of the country without reliable cellular service can access the GMO disclosure, if the agency determines they will not have sufficient access to the GMO disclosure through electronic or digital methods. <br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Comparable options need to be just as convenient as it is for someone to pull out a smartphone to scan a product.

In 2017, of the 27 member countries in the European Union, 20 member countries had increased rates of carbon dioxide emissions . France and Italy each increased their carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 by 3.2 percent. Spain increased its carbon dioxide emissions by 7.4 percent in 2017 despite generating power from wind, solar and hydroelectric resources. Spain accounted for a 7.7 percent share of Europes total emissions output in 2017. despite massive investments in renewable energy, the European Union is far from hitting this goal. Germany invested heavily in wind and solar power, but it remains the Europes largest emitter of carbon dioxide emissions. Germany spent an estimated 189 billion euros  around $222 billion  on subsidies for renewable energy since 2000 while its carbon dioxide emissions have remained at about 2009 levels. The country decreased its carbon dioxide emissions by just 0.2 percent from their 2016 levels in 2017.<br/><br/>The wind industry in Europe is burying millions of tons of toxic waste, as wind units near the end of their 20-year operating life. The European Union believed that intermittent renewables were the answer to meeting its carbon dioxide reduction goals. But, the regions carbon dioxide emissions rose by almost 2 percent in 2017 despite massive investments in renewable energy. A study of the wind industry in Europe has shown that wind energy produces idle capacity and expensive electricity as duplicative power sources must exist to provide power when the wind is not blowing and when wind capacity is not operating.<br/><br/>Germanys Energiewende has not made a major contribution to the environment or to Germanys climate. But since renewable energy subsidies are financed through electric bills, Energiewende is a major reason why prices for German consumers have doubled since 2000. Germans now pay about three times more for residential electricity than consumers in the United States.<br/><br/>German wind farm operators will be forced to dismantle and recycle their turbines, which is very expensive and not included in their price of the wind power. Further, the large blades, which are made of fiberglass composite materials and whose components cannot be separated from each other, are almost impossible to recycle and burning the blades is extremely difficult, toxic and energy-intensive. According to German law, the massive 3000-metric ton reinforced concrete turbine base must be removed. Some of the concrete bases reach depths of 20 meters and penetrate multiple ground layers, which can cost several hundreds of thousands of euros to remove. Many wind farm operators have not provided for this expense. Wind farm operators are trying to circumvent this expense by removing just the top two meters of the concrete and steel base, hiding the rest with a layer of soil.<br/><br/>Germany has made it more difficult to obtain approvals for new wind farms due to an unstable power grid, noise pollution, blighted views and health hazards. So with fewer new turbines coming online, wind energy production in Germany is likely to recede in the future.<br/><br/>Germanys 29,000 wind turbines are approaching 20 years of operating life and for the most part are outdated, requiring maintenance and expensive repairs. That means their earnings will not cover the cost of their operation. Further, the generous subsidies granted at the time of their installation will soon expire, further making them unprofitable. After 2020, thousands of turbines will lose their subsidies with each successive year, and must be taken offline and mothballed. It is estimated that about 5700 turbines with an installed capacity of 45 megawatts will see their subsidies expire by 2020 and approximately 14,000 megawatts of installed capacity will lose their subsidies by 2023, which is more than a quarter of Germanys wind capacity. Thus, Germany will be left with hundreds of thousands of 2 to 300 metric tons of turbine parts littering its landscape.<br/><br/>2018 The Chinese governments announce significant cut down in subsidies offered to the nations solar projects, dealt a major blow to the solar industry worldwide. utility-scale solar projects will be cut and distributed generation (DG) projects will be capped until further notice.<br/><br/>Countries are finding that offshore wind is not only expensive, but noisy too. wind turbines off its Atlantic coast where the wind blows consistently and the noise is constant.<br/><br/>Massachusetts and Rhode Island have some of the highest electricity prices in the continental United States.

I believe in complete transparency, that is that people should EASILY be able to find out the ingredients and whether they are genetically engineered or not. <br/><br/>I do not take a position on genetically engineered food, but believe that each person should make up his/her mind on whether they choose these products or not. <br/><br/>The proposed new regulations do not provide the consumer with the necessary information. I understand that many of the newer types of Genetically Engineering will be excluded which is unfortunate. I believe if a product contains any ingredient that is genetically engineered it should be labeled as containing such products.<br/><br/>I am very much opposed to allowing companies to use QR codes instead of readable labels. Many of us do not use our cell phones for this purpose. I certainly dont. Why allow this? What is gained, except confusing the public. If you agree that consumers deserve to know what is in their foods and make their own judgments about what to accept or avoid, why make this more difficult? You should be making it easier for consumers not more difficult. <br/><br/>As I said previously, I am not for or against genetically engineered foods, but believe in transparency. If you accept this new labeling scheme, the result will be confusion and give the food companies the ability to disguise and mislead the public. I ask you as a consumer to stop these new rules from taking effect. Please enact rules that give complete transparency in an easy to understand format. <br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Paul Kaplan ",

My general statement is to align the ACAA with the Americans with Disabilities Act and its basis of reasonable accommodation. This alignment will resolve many of the issues brought forward by the DOT relating to species limitations, abuse by fraudulent animals, quantity concerns, inappropriate behavior, and documentation. The revised ACAA should:<br/><br/>1. Create a consistent environment across all air carriers to limit confusion among passengers and airline personnel. <br/>2. Respect the needs of all, while protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities who must travel with a service animal. <br/>3. Include special accommodations for service dogs in training when under the control of a certified service dog trainer. To prevent fraud, it is reasonable for the DOT to enforce special requirements that trainers must meet to identify themselves, such as a trainer identification card from an accredited organization.<br/>4. Include collaboration with industry leaders to establish acceptable in-flight behavior by service dogs as well as developing required training for airline staff. <br/>5. Empower airline employees to restrict unreasonable access to untrained animals that display agreed upon behaviors that disrupt business - in this case, the execution of safe and timely air travel.<br/><br/>Thank you for your solicitation of public comment on this important issue.",

    "text": "According to the US Department of Justice&#39;s regulations, only dogs can be recognized as service animals.  This restriction should equally apply to traveling by air, since no other animals can legitimately provide seeing-eye service or other services for legitimately disabled individuals.  In addition, the DOJ regulations recognize that where individuals with animal dander allergies are required to be in the same room as a service dog, they both should be accommodated by assigning them, if possible, to different locations within the room or different rooms in the facility.  However, due to the confined nature of airplane cabins, it is important to ensure there is a sufficient buffer between service animals and allergy sufferers.  In the first class or business cabin, it is almost impossible to create a sufficient buffer between animals and allergic passengers. Accordingly, any regulation established by the Department of Transportation should ensure that service animals and legitimate allergy sufferers are not placed in the same first-class or business cabin.  The regulations should require that airlines create a system that precludes a person with a service animal from booking a first-class or business-class ticket if an allergy sufferer has already booked a seat, and vice versa.  In addition, the regulations should require that airlines create a buffer zone in the economy cabin of at least eight rows between any allergy sufferer and a service animal passenger.  To qualify, the allergy sufferer and the service animal passenger should each be required to present to the airline a doctor&#39;s note that identifies the allergies or certifies that the service animal is certified to perform a legitimate service for a disabled passenger.  The DOT should look to Air Canada&#39;s policies regarding service animals and allergy sufferers for a good model for accommodating allergy sufferers.",

Thats why I support clear, consumer-friendly GMO labels on ALL foods containing GMO ingredients. <br/><br/>The proposed rule allows companies to disclose GMOs solely through digital disclosures, while doing nothing to guarantee Americans without smartphones or cell service will have access to vital information about their food. <br/><br/>The USDA needs to ensure ALL Americans have access to GMO disclosures. Heres why: <br/><br/>- A Deloitte study found that nearly one-in-four Americans dont own a smartphone and that three-in-four dont know that you can scan QR codes to get production information. Most have never scanned a code to get food information, and 85 percent of Americans who have tried said they have struggled with mobile scanning apps. Compounding the fact that many Americans still dont have smartphones is the fact that more than 20 million American have lousy cell service. That means that it will take a long time for the GMO information to load  if it loads at all. <br/><br/>- The proposed rule currently does not provide comparable options. The text message option included in the proposed rule should not be considered a comparable option because it is not clear that this option must be included in addition to the digital disclosure. Additionally, millions of Americans who live in rural areas may not have reliable cellphone service that would allow them to send or receive text messages. <br/><br/>- The law clearly directs the USDA secretary to provide additional and comparable options so that consumers who dont have smartphones or live in parts of the country without reliable cellular service can access the GMO disclosure, if the agency determines they will not have sufficient access to the GMO disclosure through electronic or digital methods. <br/><br/>- Comparable options need to be just as convenient as it is for someone to pull out a smartphone to scan a product. This could most easily be achieved by requiring stores to place scanners in every aisle of grocery stores, unless a retailer requires that manufacturers disclose the presence of GMOs on packages. <br/><br/>I urge you to create a clear, consumer-friendly GMO labeling standard that ensures ALL Americans have access to vital information about their food. <br/><br/>Thank you.",

Of course this requires an internet connection and a smart phone or other device.  It is estimated that 130 million Americans lack the resources to do this.  QR codes allow companies to camouflage their GMO ingredient information.  This is not acceptable.  Let the USDA know that clear product clear package labeling is essential, not the use of QR<br/>    codes or enhanced UPC codes.<br/><br/>    The USDA has released some preliminary logos for potential use with GMO products. The smiley face, feel-good images provide no value other than encouraging your acceptance of the product.  The use of the lettering, BE, is disingenuous.  It is supposed to stand for bioengineered, a term most consumers are not familiar with (most are familiar with GE/genetic engineering or GMO/genetically modified organism).  To make it even more confusing, the image closely resembles logos used in the European Union to signify organic products.  How insulting is that?

Companies are already using the terms GMO &amp; GE and should be permitted to continue.  <br/><br/>3) Require neutral symbols. <br/>The disclosure law permits the use of symbols instead of text. However, two of three symbols proposed by USDA are cartoonishly pro-biotech propaganda, with blatantly biased smiley faces (see below). Symbols should be content neutral and easy for consumers to understand. <br/><br/>4) Include all processed foods produced with genetic engineering. <br/>The vast majority of GE foods are not whole foods but processed foodssuch as cooking oils, sodas, and candiesmade with GE corn, soy, canola, and sugar beets. Many of these products are so highly refined that current DNA tests may or may not show the GE content, despite the source of the ingredient(s) indisputably being GE. <br/><br/>5) Ensure future food products made with newer forms of genetic engineering are covered. <br/>Companies are currently experimenting with newer forms of genetic engineering, such as gene-editing. Foods such as oranges, cacao, potatoes, soy, and canola bioengineered with CRISPR are in development. USDA must ensure that any foods made with these newer forms of GE are required to be labeled. <br/><br/>6) Harmonize with the European Union (EU) standard. <br/>USDA proposes two options for disclosure of GE content arising from unintentional contamination0.9% or 5%. The 0.9% threshold is best because it is high enough to cover contamination; has long been established in the EU and would facilitate trade with EU countries; and it aligns with existing standards of many US food companies. <br/><br/>7) Demand disclosure now, not postponed until 2022. <br/>The labeling law requires regulations be finalized by July 29, 2018. However, USDA would allow companies to postpone GMO labeling until as late as 2022. This is an entirely unreasonable delay. Many companies are already labeling. Demand that companies be required to use GMO content labels by January 1, 2020.<br/>",

GMOs must be labeled clearly, as GMOs, for people to make decisions about what they purchase for themselves &amp; their families. The proposed food disclosure standard does not include new genetic engineering techniques such as CRISPR &amp; Synbio. Call it a GMO if it&#39;s made through the transgenic process, but also for any genetic modification. Use the term GMO. Don&#39;t confuse consumers with new term bioengineered or BE - the label &quot;GMO&quot; is already trademarked by USDA. The proposed symbols in the food disclosure standard are not neutral.<br/><br/>There must be oversight of the labeling, including PENALTIES for non-compliance that are sufficient to induce compliance. The proposed &#39;standard&#39; contains unnecessary exemptions, such as oils &amp; sugars. If those items are produced from GMOs, they should be labeled GMO. If the intention is to downplay the presence of GMOs, include the amount of GMOs in the product instead of the proposed 5-10% GMO contamination by weight before requiring the label.<br/>    <br/>Finally, labeling should take effect long before the proposed date of 2022! Companies change the labels on their products with little or no notice to consumers - they can make this change without such an extended lead time.<br/>",

    "text": "Regarding the proposed usage of &quot;bioengineered&quot; instead of &quot;genetically modified&quot; or &quot;genetically engineered,&quot; I think that the term bigoengineered is relatively new to the public, which is more familiar with GMO and genetically modified, and consequentially, may have a better understanding of what a GMO and other genetically modified foods are. While bioengineered may be a fancier, more encompassing umbrella word for the future of the industry, I doubt its intended use is to that effect. Instead, it is my belief that the word bioengineered is intended to obfuscate what a genetically modified organism/food is in order to aid food manufacturers, who do not wish or are not capable of meeting current self-regulatory market standards set forth by the Non-GMO Project that was founded in 2007, in their marketing pursuits. I would prefer the AMS modify the language of this proposed rule to align itself better with the concepts and language set forth by the Non-GMO Project regarding GMOs, specifically using the terms Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) and genetically modified.<br/><br/>Regarding the proposed usage of digital QR codes on labels, I find this proposal highly unacceptable. All food products&#39; labels should have human readable text that a human-being can read immediately without the use of an external tool and/or an Internet connection. Setting aside that a person has to purchase an electronic device, most likely with a cellular plan, to access the Internet, it&#39;s cumbersome to pull out such a device to then read not just one product&#39;s label but the label of every product that I&#39;m physically looking at and considering purchasing in the grocery store, and then hope that the Internet connection and the QR lookup service are working in order to get the relevant information.<br/><br/>Regarding exempting highly refined foods from labeling, I don&#39;t think that any food products should be exempted from labeling, especially highly refined or processed foods as most foods/food products consumed by Americans are in fact processed and/or highly refined foods. Perhaps there&#39;s a public misconception about GMOs as to whether/not they&#39;re healthy, therefore the food industry is concerned that if they are forced to label their products then they&#39;ll become less profitable. Perhaps that&#39;s a valid concern, but I know that a GMO is not necessarily good nor bad, better or worse for you compared to a non-GMO, however more aptly, issues with processed foods are the sugar/fat ratio manipulation, typical lack of fiber and the various chemicals for flavoring and preservation. Is the food industry worried that they&#39;ll have to label a single product because at least one ingredient may be genetically modified? If so, understood, but we&#39;re defining terms/definitions. If the definition accurately reflects a product then it ought to be labelled as such.<br/><br/>Bottom line:<br/>Use common, simple terms that are already widely used in the public dialog.<br/>Mandate human readable text that can be read without the aid of external tools/systems.<br/>Do not provide food labeling exemptions for highly refined/processed foods.<br/>Apply definitions uniformly across all food products without corrupting the definition to accommodate certain foods.",

Thats why I support clear, consumer-friendly GMO labels on ALL foods containing GMO ingredients.<br/><br/>The proposed rule allows companies to disclose GMOs solely through digital disclosures, while doing nothing to guarantee Americans without smartphones or cell service will have access to vital information about their food.<br/><br/>The USDA needs to ensure ALL Americans have access to GMO disclosures. Heres why:<br/><br/>- A Deloitte study found that nearly one-in-four Americans dont own a smartphone and that three-in-four dont know that you can scan QR codes to get production information. Most have never scanned a code to get food information, and 85 percent of Americans who have tried said they have struggled with mobile scanning apps. Compounding the fact that many Americans still dont have smartphones is the fact that more than 20 million American have lousy cell service. That means that it will take a long time for the GMO information to load  if it loads at all.<br/><br/>- The proposed rule currently does not provide comparable options. The text message option included in the proposed rule should not be considered a comparable option because it is not clear that this option must be included in addition to the digital disclosure. Additionally, millions of Americans who live in rural areas may not have reliable cellphone service that would allow them to send or receive text messages.<br/><br/>- The law clearly directs the USDA secretary to provide additional and comparable options so that consumers who dont have smartphones or live in parts of the country without reliable cellular service can access the GMO disclosure, if the agency determines they will not have sufficient access to the GMO disclosure through electronic or digital methods.<br/><br/>- Comparable options need to be just as convenient as it is for someone to pull out a smartphone to scan a product. This could most easily be achieved by requiring stores to place scanners in every aisle of grocery stores, unless a retailer requires that manufacturers disclose the presence of GMOs on packages.<br/><br/>I urge you to create a clear, consumer-friendly GMO labeling standard that ensures ALL Americans have access to vital information about their food.<br/><br/>Thank you.

    "text": "I fully support the Small Business in Transportation Coalition&#39;s request for exemption from the Electronic Logging Device rule. The rule is not necessary, and does not do what it was enacted to do. The ELD mandate is NOT a safety issue, as FMCSA purports it to be. FMCSA&#39;s own records show that over 90% of accidents involving trucks are not the fault of truck drivers, but rather the fault of automobile drivers involved in accidents with trucks. There is no evidence to prove the ELDs have any effect on the number of truck accidents.<br/><br/>Secondly, i am very concerned with the federal government&#39;s mandating private businesses to purchase a device strictly for the convenience of law enforcement. ELDs do not help the driver in any way, they are costly and burdensome and do not make a CMV drivers work any easier.<br/><br/>Third, I&#39;m concerned with the security and accuracy of the date being collected by ELDs. Where is the data being stored? Who has access to the data? Can the devices be hacked? All of these are serious questions that have not been answered by the government.<br/><br/>Upon review of SBTC&#39;s application for exemption, I notice on page 7 they note &quot;if the exemption is not granted, we will likely see a major disrution to the motor carrier industry due to the cost of both becoming and remaining compliant with the ELD technology.&quot; Indeed, reports are now surfacing that the trucking industry is losing drivers for reason specifically related to the ELD mandate.<br/><br/>SBTC&#39;s ELD mandate exemption request for carriers with fewer than 50 employees is reasonable because carriers with more than 50 employees would have the financial resources to comply with the rule. That is, they would have the resources to purchase and install the ELDs on every truck in their fleet, and would be able to train all of their drivers and would have the personnel to manage all of the data compiled by the ELDs in their fleet. Smaller carriers would be put at a financial hardship trying to comply with the mandate.<br/><br/>Because the ELD mandate is not necessary for CMV drivers to do their job, they do not increase safety in the trucking industry, the data they collect is not secure and it is a financial burden to small carriers, I support the Small Business in Transportation Coalition&#39;s exemption request and I ask FMCSA to grant the exemption.",

    "text": "I&#39;m writing you because, this topic of GM or GMO labeling is important for several reasons. The first being that everyone has the right to choose what they eat and if there are not labels( not number codes or sunshine happy faces with BE inside). The labeling needs to refer to ANY ingredients in a product that are GM or GMO, not matter how you formulate it. Please allow this labeling to be honest so consumers can make an educated choice of what foods they wish to consume and those they do not. <br/>The second issue is; that as a small farmer GM/ GMO affects the &quot; all natural&#39; crops I grow for my families own use and for the use of our animals. It&#39;s been proven over and over how easily these GM/ GMO crops cross pollinate and corrupt heirloom/ natural crops. These GM/ GMO foods for human consumption and feed for animals are taking over and those who are educated about them, do not wish to consume them or have their &quot;natural crops&quot; corrupted.  <br/>I urge USDA to provide clear, on-package labeling of foods that contain ingredients made from genetically engineered crops, regardless of the specific type of technology used.<br/> Thank you for your time in this matter<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Sincerely,<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Mr. Mike and Mrs. Kelle Ventling<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Fromberg, MT 59029",
