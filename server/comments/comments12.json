    "text": "I am writing to provide comments AGAINST the Repeal of the Clean Power plan.  I have a PhD in Ecology and feel that my expertise in plant ecology and soil nutrients is relevant to the issue.  There is no question that the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the subsequent changes to our climate and ocean chemistry are a grave threat to the health and security of the United States of America and to the world.  <br/><br/>First, increasing carbon dioxide and climate change undermines our ability to feed our people.  The majority of our food is grown in the Great Plains and in California.  Both of these regions have experienced several extreme droughts in the last decade and we are anticipating another drought this summer.  This reduces our ability to grow food to feed our people.  It also represents a large economic hardship for our farmers, who must invest in seed and chemicals at the start of each field season, but then lose that money as the crops die.  Frequent droughts also reduce the ability of our fallow lands to sequester carbon, which further accelerates warming.   Ocean acidification also reduces our ability to harvest seafood to feed people.<br/><br/>Second, climate change increases the frequency of natural disasters, for example in the last year we saw three massive hurricanes hit the US. These hurricanes have cost billions of dollars to rebuild infrastructure and homes, not to mention lost productivity.<br/><br/>Third, warmer temperatures experienced by climate change will affect people&#39;s health in a negative way. Mosquitos are carriers of disease and their populations will increase with temperature. Other insects, such as the Emerald Ash Borer, are moving northward as the winters are warmer.  These health care costs (as well as the costs of removing trees) also have negative effects on family and our nation&#39;s budgets.<br/><br/>While the Clean Power Plan costs businesses (and ultimately the consumers) money for implementation, this economic cost pales in comparison to the money lost to natural disasters, changes in agricultural productivity, and health care spending.  I am writing to strongly support the current standards.  I do not think that they should be rolled back.<br/>Thank you<br/>Lori Biederman, Ames Iowa<br/>",

    "text": "Flavors of e-liquid are a necessity to help people switch from the deadly habit of smoking to the safer (by 95%) habit of vaping. Smokers want their nicotine fix, so why would you not want them to switch to a method of intake that is almost guaranteed to help them live healthier and better lives. Smoking is the leading cause of increases of heart disease and cancer, these illnesses are negated by switching to vaping. I understand where you are coming from, as far as the appeal of vaping to minors due to flavor, but minors are smoking cigarettes and those are disgusting tasting. People are going to smoke regardless of the regulations about them, but vaping is a healthier and safer alternative all around. I appeal to you to examine the statistics of how many lives have been improved by vaping. Do we want minors vaping? No, but that fact remains that many minors smoke. Since people are always going to try to get their nicotine fix, vaping is a method that should be embraced not ostracized. Flavors give people a bigger reason to make the healthier switch. Instead of stricter regulation, vaping should be embraced as the public safety benefit that it is. There is no second hand contamination, there is little harm to the user, and it doesn&#39;t cause the diseases that tobacco combustion causes. So please, think of the benefits before you restrict a product that can help eliminate the damage caused by tobacco.",

I tried many flavors before finding a peach/strawberry flavor.

This proposal to revise the Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities (CCR) rule would drastically weaken federal standards for coal ash storage and proposal, and put the publics health and safety at risk.<br/><br/>Pollutants from coal ash in groundwater present a serious health risk. The recent release of groundwater monitoring data by coal-fired power plants demonstrates that coal ash is causing widespread contamination to groundwater around the nation. Yet, this proposal would weaken groundwater protection standards, and potentially allow polluters themselves to decide when to stop monitoring groundwater as well as whether or not they need to clean up contamination.<br/><br/>These revisions would put many communities living near coal ash sites back into the dark about pollutants in their groundwater caused by coal ash and limit their ability to take action when their water supplies are contaminated. Therefore, I oppose all revisions that would give polluters the power to create alternative requirements for groundwater standards, monitoring, and clean-up.<br/><br/>I also oppose making revisions that would allow companies to continue to use dangerous or leaking coal ash sites. Companies should not be given the power to decide when a leaking coal pond needs to be closed or retrofitted. Furthermore, I support the prohibitions on storing or disposing of coal ash in unsafe areas such as in the water table, wetlands, floodplains, fault and seismic zones, or unstable areas, and oppose any plans to weaken or eliminate these.<br/><br/>Many of these proposed revisions would take away the federal minimum standards. Without uniform minimum standards throughout the nation, we will go back to having a patchwork of regulations, with some states, under the influence of powerful industry, failing to implement meaningful protections. Strong federal standards are needed to prevent power companies from irresponsibly disposing of coal ash. Coal ash is toxic and the standards for it must be more stringent than the standards for household garbage.<br/><br/>Additionally, I think this comment period does not adequately provide for meaningful public engagement in this significant proposal. EPA failed to hold any hearings in impacted communities to discuss this proposal and is only allowing 45 days for the public to comment.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Karen Slote<br/>",

In November 2017, NMFS implemented an emergency rule that set the 2017 commercial and recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for red snapper in the South Atlantic at 42,510 fish.  Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.  The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

The options considered in the scoping document look specifically at management measures originally intended to reduce mortality of bluefin tuna, questioning whether the individual bluefin tuna quota (IBQ) program in place since 2015 affects the need for these measures. We agree that the IBQ program has been successful and commend NOAA Fisheries on its implementation. However, the western population of Atlantic bluefin tuna remains severely depleted, at approximately half of its already depleted 1974 level. The Gulf of Mexico is the populations only known major spawning ground, and it is critical to continue to protect spawning bluefin tuna during their spawning season. The current international quota is predicted to lead to further population decline for the foreseeable future, making protection of the spawning grounds even more important. Therefore, we strongly urge NOAA Fisheries (1) to exclude any consideration of modifications to the Gulf of Mexico Gear Restricted Areas (GRAs) from any proposed rule and (2) to retain a January through June seasonal requirement for use of weak hooks on pelagic longline vessels.<br/><br/>The Gulf GRAs enacted through Amendment 7 to the Consolidated Atlantic HMS FMP have exceeded expectations for their reduction of bluefin tuna mortality. Average annual bluefin tuna interactions during the April and May closure months are 82 percent lower than before the GRAs were in place. Interactions is a key point since NMFS electronic tagging studies have found that more than half of all bluefin caught on longlines in the Gulf of Mexico are dead at haulback. Time-area closures are the most effective way to avoid interactions. Neither the IBQ program, nor weak hooks, nor any other existing restriction on longline fishing can completely avoid interactions  and thus mortality  as the GRAs can. Furthermore, any relatively minor reductions in target catch as a result of the GRAs are offset by the ability to use alternative gears in the GRAs, including with funding through the Deepwater Horizon Oceanic Fish Restoration Projects longline repose program. The Gulf GRAs have been in place for just three spawning seasons and have been more effective at reducing wasteful mortality of spawning bluefin tuna than expected. It is premature and ill-advised to give any further consideration to modifying the Gulf of Mexico GRAs at this time.<br/><br/>Year-round use of weak hooks has been mandatory in the Gulf of Mexico since 2011, intended to straighten and release large spawning bluefin tuna from longlines. The weak hooks are another success story, having reduced dead discards of bluefin in the Gulf of Mexico by almost 75 percent. However, there is some concern about the weak hooks reducing target catch and increasing catch of white marlin. Therefore, we support a compromise to change the year-round requirement to a seasonal requirement for the months of January through June. This 6-month weak hook mandate would maintain protection for spawning bluefin tuna during the months of highest longline catch rates, while allowing the use of regular hooks for the other half of the year (including the months of higher white marlin catch rates).<br/><br/>The Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab at Duke University commends NOAA Fisheries on the success of Amendment 7 at meeting its multiple objectives. We look forward to working with you to ensure that any changes proposed through this potential rulemaking do not undermine this success. Most importantly, options related to the Gulf of Mexico GRAs should not be included in the proposed rule, and a 6-month seasonal requirement for weak hook use should be included.<br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Guillermo Ortuno Crespo<br/>Ph.D. Candidate in Marine Science &amp; Conservation<br/>Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab, Duke University",

A 2006 study found that just in the cotton fields of Texas, Mexican free-tailed bats saved farmers an annual average of $724,000 in pest control costs and losses from insect-related damages. Extrapolating that to the country as a whole, a follow-on study in 2011 estimated that bats are worth around $23 billion in pest suppression services.

In that light, the economic services bats provide is a real and quantifiable sum. USDA meteorologist John Westbrook are looking at the seasonal movement of insects and how bats track and exploit them. Over three seasons in Uvalde, Texas, they found that bats were eating 44 different agricultural pests, 20 of which were migratory. Insect pests are threats to important agricultural crops including those in fruit farms, bats provide an important ecosystem service by eating and depleting pest populations. <br/>Bats feed on some of the most damaging crop pests  just how many tons of insects the bats are eatingmostly agricultural pests, And as they munch their way through 140 to 147 tons of insectsnearly 300,000 pounds of bugs each and every night during the growing seasonbats provide a huge, yet mostly hidden, service to the United States agricultural communities. including the moths of cutworms and armyworms  which helps to protect food crops naturally. Most of the farmers say  the pest control and crop protection services they provide saves thousands.   Many put up bat boxes on their farms to provide a home for them. In this region of Texas, bats nightly foraging occurs over huge tracts of land planted in corn, cotton and sorghum. Their prey: primarily moths, especially the adults of corn earworm and cotton bollworm moths. With each female moth capable of laying up to 1,000 eggs, every moth consumed by a bat represents a major reduction in the millions of dollars of potential damage that could occur. Bats control pests, eating up to 1,200 insects an hour. The bat is on the hunt for insects, and according to new research, farmers have a billion reasons to be grateful for it. Research recently written by former graduate student Josiah Maine and his adviser at Southern Illinois University Carbondale shows that bats play a significant role in combating crop pests.<br/><br/>",

Countless die at wind turbines elsewhere in the U.S. and Canada in the forests and fields of the Midwest and the windy prairies of the Great Plains.   Much of this slaughterthe greatest threat to animals that are a vital link in our ecosystem.<br/>The number of bats killed across the entire United States  2020 an estimated 33,000 to 111,000 bats will be killed annually by wind turbines in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands alone . Bats are particularly susceptible to wind turbines, when extrapolated to one million bats deaths, that would be between 660 and 1320 metric tons of insects are no longer being consumed each year. <br/>Value of bats to the agricultural industry is roughly $22.9 billion/ year. as high as $53 billion/year. These estimates include the reduced costs of pesticide applications that are not needed to suppress the insects consumed by bats .   This will likely have long-term cumulative impacts on both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. single colony of 150 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in Indiana has been estimated to eat nearly 1.3 million pest insects each year, single little brown bat can consume 4 to 8 g of insects each night .  <br/>The loss of bats in North America could lead to agricultural losses estimated at more than $3.7 billion/year.  Bats are important pollinators and help farmers through their pest-control capabilities and nectar-feeding acts. But declining bat populations from wind Turbines leave big impact. <br/>Corn farmers love winged mammals put more than $1 billion back into your collective pockets, a new study suggests. value of pest suppression services provided by bats range  from about $12 to $173/acre (with a most likely scenario of $74/acre) in a cotton-dominated agricultural landscape in south-central Texas   On the whole, bats increased crop yield by 1.4%a benefit that, on average and at current corn prices, adds up to a difference of about $7.88 per hectare ($3.18 per acre) and more than $1 billion worldwide. The drop in damage could be attributed to bats, the researchers say.   the loss of 6 million bats due to Windfarms can  result in more than 1300 metric tons of insects escaping bat predation every year.

In November 2017, NMFS implemented an emergency rule that set the 2017 commercial and recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for red snapper in the South Atlantic at 42,510 fish.  Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.  The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

    "text": "I have a couple of issues with the idea of train&#39;s being ran without a conductor or engineer being on board. First of all there isn&#39;t any such thing as a failsafe system. I replace my computer every few years because all computer systems eventually fail. All Computer systems. The idea of having a train running where the backup emergency systems don&#39;t trigger a safe response to an emergency scares me to death. The idea of a chlorine loaded train going into a sharp curve into a populated community potentially derailing because of a computer failure doesn&#39;t sound like the public&#39;s best interests are at the heart of testing autonomous trains. <br/>Furthermore, crossing protections, a computer doesn&#39;t see like a human being does. In some instances while on board a train we&#39;ve been able to see a stranded vehicle on the rails and stop in time. We were able to stop because we could see and respond accurately to the situation. Even if theres a safety feature that would stop the train I foresee the railroads quickly disabling them as the amount of people that run around the crossing protections would trigger trains to come to a stop everywhere. <br/>Suicides. What does the autonomous train do during a suicide situation? Does it detect the difference between a dog and a child that may have wandered into the path of the train without any person to react to that horrible situation? <br/>I&#39;m not against PTC but it&#39;s not a failsafe system either. This is an untested system that hasn&#39;t even been completely put into service yet and you&#39;re already looking for the next step to remove all human interference to respond during an emergency. <br/>There&#39;s no addressing of what to do during an intentional sabotage where a computer hacker could potentially interfere with the trains autonomous commands. No human up on the head end to throw a switch to enable the trains emergency braking system in such a situation. <br/>I would point your attention to the Metrolink collision in California that had a large impact into the cell phone ban on the railroads. Blame was accurately placed on the engineer that was texting during that collision. Your agency failed to accurately place blame on the commuter company that had removed the conductor from the head end of that train. We will never know for certain that had the second person been on board that train would have been able to save those innocent lives. But you still lack the courage to do the right thing and mandate a two person crew on the head end of a locomotive to prevent future incidents. But now you want to have input about completely removing all human interference asking about safety and efficiency. I am amazed at your ability to pretend to care about the safety aspect.<br/> I think a good representation of my view of autonomous vehicles was portrayed by Hollywood in the 2017 movie Logan. It depicts autonomous tractor trailers driving without any regard to the human life it shared on the highways in the fictional movie. Thats because a computer simply does what its commands tell it to do. We have a conscience that allows us to use tools that a computer does not possess such as compassion to those nearby in distress. This allows us to try to stop the train to avoid a collision and to notify our dispatchers of the situation to be able to send the proper emergency personnel to save as many as possible. <br/> I do not believe autonomous trains are in the best interest of anyone but the railroads executives and shareholders who may not understand the gravity of the dangers they pose but are simply grateful for the bonuses and dividends.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Thank you for your time.

In November 2017, NMFS implemented an emergency rule that set the 2017 commercial and recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for red snapper in the South Atlantic at 42,510 fish.  Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.

    "text": "Dear members of the committee,<br/><br/>I am a physician specializing in medical genetics with special expertise in achondroplasia and clinical trials for genetic conditions.  I have been a practicing geneticist for 23 years and have taken care of more than 100 individuals with achondroplasia.  I have been involved in developing a treatment for achondroplasia for many years, bringing the concept to BioMarin.  I have no intellectual property in the drug development and will not benefit financially if it is approved. <br/><br/>As an expert in skeletal disorders, I am sensitive to the concerns of some in the dwarf community about developing a treatment where the primary goal is to increase ultimate height. It is certainly their right not to treat their own children with such a drug. This situation is similar to the decisions parents in the deaf community make about cochlear implants for children with congenital hearing loss. However, the majority of children with achondroplasia are born to average stature parents. These families almost uniformly have a sincere desire to increase the height of their children and allow them to function more easily in an average stature world. Their right to treat their children with such a drug should also be respected.<br/><br/>The choices for an outcome measure for a clinical trial are limited. Most parents, whether they are little people or not, would support a treatment that reduces the need for surgical interventions such as foramen magnum decompression in young infants, tympanostomy tubes and adenoidectomies in young children, tibial bowing correction in adolescence, and laminectomy for spinal stenosis in adults. Demonstrating a reduction in complications is certainly a desirable but would be extremely difficult to show in a reasonable time frame given the variable need for operations for complications that are spread throughout the lifespan of an achondroplast. <br/><br/>The most sensible primary measure is an increase in height velocity. The current trial design has a placebo control for a year followed by an open label extension. A year is sufficient to show that growth velocity is improved. The subsequent open label study provides cross-over data for those on placebo and is adequate to show a sustained increase in growth velocity in the subjects treated with active drug throughout. Requiring a placebo-controlled trial longer than a year is unnecessary and ethically questionable. The natural history of growth in achondroplasia is well known and the growth curves have been improved by BioMarins natural history study. In addition, all but the youngest infants will have at least 6 months of longitudinal pre-treatment growth data before entering the drug trial. A sustained increase in growth velocity will not occur on its own.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration,<br/><br/>William Wilcox, MD, PhD<br/>Professor of Human Genetics<br/>Emory University<br/>Whitehead Biomedical Research Building, 305H<br/>615 Michael Street<br/>Atlanta, GA 30322<br/><br/>",

And, while a bump stock is in operation, the trigger functions separately every time a round is discharged.<br/><br/>So these regulations are proposing a radical change -- as they effectively define a gun as a machinegun even if the trigger resets for every round that is fired, so long as the finger only pulls the trigger once.<br/><br/>While bump stock devices will now be treated as machineguns under these regulations, they also raise serious questions in regard to AR-15s and other semi-automatic rifles -- as they are now on the brink of being designated as machineguns by the next anti-gun administration.<br/><br/>In the past, one had to fundamentally change the firing mechanism of a semi-automatic firearm to convert it into a fully automatic firearm.<br/><br/>But now according to these regulations, a bump stock is a machinegun -- and it can &quot;readily restore&quot; a semi-auto into a machinegun, simply because the gun owner can effectively fire the weapon continuously with a single pull of the trigger. This would invoke the statutory definition for a rifle, which is classified as a machinegun (26 USC 5845(b)).<br/><br/>It wont matter that a gun which is being bump fired has not been fundamentally altered.  AR-15s will be on the brink of extinction once these regulations go into force.<br/><br/>These regulations dismiss Second Amendment protections, by appealing to the Heller court decision.

    "docAbstract": "NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 43.  In November 2017, NMFS implemented an emergency rule that set the 2017 commercial and recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for red snapper in the South Atlantic at 42,510 fish.  Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.  The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

    "text": "I want to make clear my opposition to the Federal Railroad Administration in regards to the implementation and testing of autonomous trains in the United States. As a railroad employee, I have firsthand knowledge of train operations and find it nearly incomprehensible that the Federal Railroad Administration would consider such a request.<br/>Recently Sam Al-Ibrahim, FRA Division Chief of Signal, Train Control and Communication stated in a recent article in Trains magazine that Positive Train Control (PTC) and Trip Optimizer (TO) have provided the building blocks for autonomous trains. How can he make such comments when the use of autonomous technology in the rail industry is extremely limited, not fully developed and has been found to have enormous complications and failures? Even the limited implementation of safety overlay systems including positive train control and trip optimizer, both developed as a safety overlay system to assist human performance not replace it, have proven to be unreliable. Trip optimizer has had several documented failures that without human oversight could have led to catastrophic results. Positive train control also has not been implemented long enough with human oversight to even fully study what impact it may have or what complications and faults need to be corrected.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>PTC and TO have been promoted and implemented as a safety enhancement to human performance, not for autonomously operating trains without on-train human oversight. Have we been misled by the FRA previously? Is all of this yet another example of the railroads placing profits ahead of public and employee safety?<br/>It is my understanding that one of the primary responsibilities of the FRA is to ensure that public and employee safety is placed at the forefront of any policy or regulation. It is my belief that this proposal reduces, not enhances safety for all involved.<br/>If the FRA truly wanted to develop and implement new and emerging technologies that enhance safety and increase railroad operations and efficiencies, then it should start with the enactment of electronic pneumatic brakes on all rail equipment to assist with the ability to slow and stop trains. It should also mandate that two certified crew members must be in the cab of the locomotive to ensure safe and efficient operations.<br/>There have been countless examples of technology failure that has led to fatal accidents, including autonomous vehicles and shuttle systems. That number increases when you factor in sabotage and acts of terrorism. Replacing the on-train human element with remote technology does not enhance but diminishes public and employee safety.<br/>Based on the aforementioned comments I ask that you deny the implementation and testing of autonomous trains in the United States.",

    "text": "I have been a responsible and cooperative patient for the last 9 years and my conditions (in regards to my bone) are now severe arthritis and degenerative bone disease. Surgery has been done to fuse the lower part of my back. I can no longer work consistently, as my pain is still not under complete control and I do have to use my prescribed narcotics, along with other medications (+lotions and patches). I have done the recommended &#39;therapies&#39;: yoga, breathing exercises, pool activities, epidurals, etc. Problem is, my right hip has no &#39;cushioning&#39; left, looks like a slowly crumbling cookie on the cray and MRI. The specialist and my Primary were shocked I walk with the help of a Walker. Although, they did not want me to have a walker-AT ALL! I had to fight for it, and fight to get it I did (had to battle to simply get to the specialist)! I have been dealing with this issue since 2000 and gone thru the &#39;medical merry-go-round of proving my permanent injury and the need for medications. I am under the age of 45, and the bones of an 80 year old.<br/>It began with my usual pharmacy NOT having prescribed medication (yes, opioids)  and having to search for them at various pharmacies. Keep in mind that the pharmacist will NOT provide the information over the phone, as security. So one must go in and out for the search. Eventually, the pharmacies in the radius around me were no longer places to count on. I had to go farther in search of my medication.<br/>SUDDENLY, pharmacies have the problem of the Insurance provider (or State Insurance) NOT covering the medication unless there is a Prior Authorization or some kind of Doctor&#39;s authorization. This still has to be processed, no matter if you have taken the medication for a long time. A chronic pain patient is left waiting up to 48 hours to 2 weeks to hear if it will be covered. It can be denied by a regular employee, working with some kind of algorithm. NOT a Medical Professional, NOT someone who will be compassionate! The same regular employee/Insurance company can dictate &#39;Step-Therapy&#39;. An immediate change occurs, leaving the Chronic pain Patient out of the loop. If we speak up, stand for better treatment- we are penalized.<br/><br/>Now, besides the great difficulty in attempting to find one&#39;s medication; having to comply with the State regulations, Insurance company rules, Doctor&#39;s rules (monthly visits, monthly urine tests and bloodwork) Pain management contract, the stigma put upon us for the simple use of pain relief medication. <br/><br/>While I never have abused anything and have a pristine medical and a clean record.<br/><br/>You wish to make it much more difficult for us to LIVE in PAIN. Apply the rules that are already being followed by RESPONSIBLE PAIN PATIENTS and Our Compassionate Doctors. I am certain anyone reading this has had a family member or someone else, who has been in pain or suffering daily. Why would you make them have to go to the pharmacy every few days to fill a prescription? Why make our doctors be dictated to in regards in how they administer pain medication. Guidelines would be better, a recommendation on new patients, etc. but chronic patients (cancer, AIDS, post operation, etc.) have already gone through the referrals and there is nothing that can be done to improve our conditions-<br/>at least let us be without severe and crippling pain.<br/>Fight the FENTANYL in the STREETS!<br/>",

Below I outline how your proposal will leave communities and our environment vulnerable to toxic coal ash contamination and catastrophic spills.<br/><br/>GUTTING OF GROUNDWATER PROTECTION STANDARDS: I oppose your proposal to weaken the groundwater protection standards. Thousands of massive, aging coal ash pits are leaking heavy metals and toxic pollutants into groundwater. Coal ash dumping has led to water contamination and disastrous coal ash spills. Your proposal to allow states and polluters to use &quot;alternative&quot; groundwater protection standards for determining when cleanup is required will only enable states and polluters to hide the truth about contamination.<br/><br/>GUTTING OF GROUNDWATER MONITORING REQUIREMENTS: The public deserves to know if coal ash dumps in their communities are contaminating groundwater.  The groundwater monitoring requirements are vitally important to the more than 15 million households in the U.S. that rely on private wells for drinking water. It&#39;s unconscionable to allow polluters to decide when groundwater monitoring should stop.  <br/><br/>GUTTING OF CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS: Empowering polluters to avoid cleanup will result in ongoing water contamination. Allowing states or the owners of leaking dumps to determine whether cleanup or closure is necessary is dangerous. Coal ash is toxic, and weakening current standards to match those of town dumps endangers all communities that are near coal ash ponds and landfills. And just because a coal ash dump is no longer receiving waste doesn&#39;t mean that it no longer poses a threat to health and the environment. I oppose your proposal to treat coal ash like household garbage and to reduce the 30-year post-closure monitoring period for dumps that are no longer receiving waste.  <br/><br/>GUTTING OF LOCATION RESTRICTIONS: Prohibitions on dumping coal ash in groundwater, wetlands, floodplains, fault zones, seismic zones and unstable areas are commonsense requirements that prevent water contamination. I oppose your proposal to give states and polluters the discretion to ignore crucial and life-saving location prohibitions (and to do so without public notification or oversight), and reject any extension of the October 2018 deadline to comply with these requirements. <br/><br/>GUTTING CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR LEAKING UNLINED DUMPS: I strongly oppose your proposal to give states and polluters the discretion not to close or retrofit dangerous leaking unlined pits. If these leaking dumps are allowed to operate, they will keep polluting our drinking water and waterways and continue to threaten catastrophic spills. <br/><br/>THE EPAS CURRENT RULEMAKING PROCESS IS FLAWED AND LIMITS PUBLIC INPUT: The EPA has failed to consider widespread evidence of overwhelming groundwater contamination before proposing to weaken the coal ash rule. Industry data shows arsenic in groundwater near ash dumps exceeds federal drinking water standards at most plants. Dangerous levels of lead, thallium, selenium or radium are also very common.  Moreover, 45 days is far too short a time for the public to provide meaningful comment. By failing to hold any field hearings in impacted communities, the EPA is silencing the voices of those directly harmed. <br/><br/>I urge you to protect us from coal ash and preserve all of the minimum protections provided by the 2015 coal ash rule. <br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Lynda Cummingham",

You have the onus of responsibility to pay for inpatient detox for patients subject to your cruelty should this measure be approved.  Already there are patients emerging from surgery with no opiate pain relief and cancer patients report lack of pain control.  There is a responsibility to make sure there is something to replace what you are taking away, but I do not see any adequate pain control being offered.  Chronic intractable pain is very stressful on the body and detracts from healing.  Patients are being shamed at the pharmacy.  This is absurd; they did not write the prescription.  There used to be public concern about preventing suicide, but now, I guess that is what is being offered to agonized patients by default.  This is a broad brush, barbaric measure that creates immeasurable collateral damage.  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are off the table for American citizens deprived of pain relief that is strong enough when nothing else of sufficient efficacy is available.  This is a major mistake.  When did America stop caring about it&#39;s own citizens?  This measure adds to the horrible state of healthcare in the US, magnifying the damage done in the name of the almighty dollar: corruption, pharma greed and high costs of prescriptions, lack of efficacious treatment and useless therapies.  Doctors are being shamed as well if they care about patient pain control as it is.  This opiate epidemic push has gone too far already and invaded the doctor/patient relationship where it does not belong.  Street drugs are a problem, but stay out of the doctor&#39;s office and out of the pharmacy.",

I have been on the same dose of opiates for years, no increase, only decrease. I am well over 90mme and am NEVER high and have NEVER abused meds. They allow me to at least be present as a wife,mother and human. I&#39;ve tried every non narcotic pain relief method! I am not depressed, but if my meds are taken away I won&#39;t be able to even complete daily hygiene tasks or ambulate,thus have no life and will end my life before I writhe in pain,useless. Just &quot;being&quot; is agony. Opiate prescriptions are significantly down, yet drug overdoses are up! It&#39;s because the majority of overdoses are illicit street drugs, or if a prescription drug is present it was mixed with other drugs and alcohol and the person who took the prescription drug was prescribed it. The majority of chronic pain patients are using their meds responsibility. Please dont punish and kill us because of the actions of addicts! We are NOT addicts!! By all means, go after crooked doctors, drug dealers and help addicts, but keave us to our legit pain management physician! Legit pain management physicians are scared to help us! This is not right. The pendulum has swung completely to the other side and there has to be a proper medium. Causing hospitals to have pain medication shortages and taking relief from people who have tried everything and only have some life thanks to responsible and judicious pain medication use us not the answer! Addicts will still get their drugs just like alcoholics got their booze during prohibition. You will create bigger, richer, more powerful and dangerous drug cartels!! People will get meds off the street then DIE or won&#39;t and then the severe pain will cause them to DIE. Please think about this!!",

    "text": "To Whom It May Concern,<br/><br/>I strongly oppose the implementation and testing of autonomous trains in the United States. As a railroad employee, I have firsthand knowledge of train operations and find it nearly incomprehensible that the Federal Railroad Administration would consider such a request. <br/>It is my understanding that one of the primary responsibilities of the FRA is to ensure that public and employee safety is placed at the forefront of any policy or regulation. It is my belief that this proposal reduces, not enhances safety for all involved. <br/>While the addition of technology has assisted with the reduction of accidents and injuries, it is not infallible and should assist us with the safe operation of a train and not replace the human element.   <br/>The use of autonomous technology in the rail industry is extremely limited, not fully developed and has been found to have enormous complications and failures. <br/>Even the limited implementation of safety overlay systems including positive train control and trip optimizer, both developed as a safety overlay system to assist human performance not replace it, have proven to be unreliable. Trip optimizer has had several documented failures that without human oversight could have led to catastrophic results. <br/>Positive train control also has not been implemented long enough with human oversight to even fully study what impact it may have or what complications and faults need to be corrected.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>If the FRA truly wanted to develop and implement new and emerging technologies that enhance safety and increase railroad operations and efficiencies, then it should start with the enactment of electronic pneumatic brakes on all rail equipment to assist with the ability to slow and stop trains. It should also mandate that two certified crew members must be in the cab of the locomotive to ensure safe and efficient operations. <br/>There have been countless examples of technology failure that has led to fatal accidents, including autonomous vehicles and shuttle systems. That number increases when you factor in sabotage and acts of terrorism. Replacing the on-train human element with remote technology does not enhance but diminishes public and employee safety. <br/>Based on the aforementioned comments I ask that you place public and employee safety considerations well before efficient rail operations and deny the implementation and testing of autonomous trains in the United States. <br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/><br/>Peter J Harlow<br/>21 Year<br/>Engineer/Conductor<br/>Indianapolis, IN.<br/><br/>",

    "text": "Consider this contrast, just four short years ago the Federal Railroad Administration initiated a rulemaking procedure that sought<br/>to require a two-person crew (the current industry standard) on the overwhelming majority of freight trains operating in the <br/>United States.  Fast forward to today, the FRA is now requesting information from stakeholders about the possibility of <br/>automating the railroad industry (operating trains remotely without any crew members)!  This seemingly 180-degree turn by FRA<br/>is nothing short of mindboggling! <br/><br/>The impetus for the 2014 rulemaking was two devastating derailments involving crude oil trains, one involving tragic loss of life <br/>and both affecting communities in which the trains operated.  Those events were of course the Lac-Megantic derailment, which <br/>killed 47 civilians, and the Casselton, N.C. derailment which caused the evacuation of the nearby town and caused millions in <br/>damage.  Each incident highlighted train crew issues.  The Lac-Megantic derailment was partly caused by the fact that a lone<br/>crew member for that train couldn&#39;t secure it properly and that train eventually rolled away and derailed in the heart of town,<br/>causing unimaginable loss of life and property.  Casselton, on the other hand, involved adjacent trains derailing, but due to <br/>both trains having conventional crews (two-person) one of those crews were able to pull 70 some oil cars away from the <br/>derailment site and minimize overall environmental damage.<br/><br/>Although each incident had differing outcomes they share one undeniable trait, the devastating effect on the general public! <br/><br/>Trains do not operate along corridors without public interaction, they operate through communities large and small, next to <br/>schools and hospitals, homes and industries, vehicles and pedestrians.  Given these operational environments, to consider <br/>automated train operations is a direct threat to PUBLIC SAFETY!<br/><br/>While there will always exist the possibility for human error in non-automated operations (even with Positive Train Control),<br/>the fact remains that an automated train without crew members eliminates the instant responders (train crew members) that<br/>jump into action when things go wrong with a train.  Remember, trains are made up of incredibly heavy machinery that <br/>routinely break down (knuckles break, air hoses separate, equipment drags, etc.), and when that happens crew members<br/>need to be present to act, consider this:<br/><br/>Years ago in Illinois a train crewed conventionally (conductor and engineer) struck a vehicle carrying three teenagers in the<br/>dead of winter.  The conductor, after the train came to a stop, immediately walked back to the crash site to find all occupants<br/>of the car had been ejected.  Two of the individuals were obviously deceased, the third was alive and breathing but in need<br/>of immediate medical attention.  At that time, the conductor noticed emergency response personnel arriving on the scene, but<br/>they were arriving on the opposite side of the train of where the surviving victim was.  The conductor, understanding what <br/>needed to be done, contacted his engineer and after making a cut of the train had his engineer separate the train by pulling a <br/>portion of the train forward, opening up the grade crossing that the paramedics used to access the injured victim.  The <br/>medics then were able to save this victim, in the middle of the night and in the frigid conditions of winter.<br/><br/>This incident pretty much epitomizes the need for two-crew members on a train, and surely this young victim would have been<br/>fatally injured had it not been for the actions of that professional and trained crew that cold December night.  Alternatively,<br/>had that car been struck by an automated train it&#39;s highly likely that victim would have quickly succumbed to his injuries<br/>without immediate attention, which surely would not have come without the actions of an INSTANT RESPONDER.<br/><br/>While this is just one story from across America, the problem with vehicle strikes at grade crossings and pedestrian <br/>trespassing remains a major problem.  It seems that both vehicle collisions and pedestrian deaths continue an uptick, and<br/>one could only think that automated train operations would increase these unfortunate instances.<br/><br/>It&#39;s understandable, in all modes of transportation, to try to eliminate human error as much as possible for the sake of safety. <br/>But the fact remains that computers, like all machines, fail as well.  And while PTC will be an invaluable tool to improve upon<br/>the safety of rail operations, it cannot replace the people (train crew members) who instantly react when things go wrong.<br/><br/>I respect FRA&#39;s intent on improving safety within the railroad industry, but in doing so I ask that you truly take to heart the <br/>sentiments of railroad workers from across the country, the very people who know how absurd it would be to fully automate <br/>our industry.  The general public deserves it!<br/><br/>",

Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.  The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

I would want to defer to a doctor whose expertise, knowledge and insight I trust. The huge pharmaceutical companies advertise products which I can easily find in drug stores without getting a doctor&#39;s input. These are often generic in quality.<br/>With homeopathy, there are also generic products which work well-arnica for sprains and bumps; others which have been know for centuries to help certain conditions. I have used both allopathic and homeopathic remedies to great effect and results. However, the homeopathic physician must have a very broad range of understanding of the remedies available because they are more abundant and often more subtle than the anti biotic medicine. So I would urge that homeopathic remedies can be classified by said doctors (homeopaths) as either over the counter (like Advil in allopathy or whatever) and those which must be had with a doctor&#39;s prescription. <br/>Patients must be free to choose which direction to go after consulting with a trusted doctor of their own choice.<br/>Yours sincerely, Alice Stamm",

No part of the bump stock touches the trigger, only the shooter&#39;s trigger finger.  ATF&#39;s insistence otherwise is logically flawed and Rick Vasquez, former ATF director of technical decisions, stated: They are trying to target binary triggers, [bump stock] devices, and other devices, but that is such broad language, can I take that to a Gatling gun?  So now you start stretching this [new] definition, and who is going to decide what the [standard] rate of fire is?<br/>The Supreme Court in JAIME CAETANO v. MASSACHUSETTS has already ruled that weapons in &#39;common use&#39; cannot be banned when they ruled on stun guns. This decision highlights that even if a weapon was not in existence during the writing of the constitution the 2nd amendment is still applicable and applies today. Bump Stocks have become popular and there are hundreds of thousands in circulation at this time among law abiding citizens.<br/>The governmental interest in keeping law abiding citizens from owning legal self-defense items is tenuous and there is no stated policy to compensate owners for their property if made illegal. This issue is something only Congress can address. The Executive branch dictating a ruling that their own technical staff stated was not correct is unconstitutional and a gross overreach in power.<br/>Signed,<br/>John Widman<br/>Benefactor NRA Lifetime Member<br/>Virginia Citizens Defense League Member<br/>Iraq Combat Veteran &amp; Faithful Civil Servant<br/>",

As a railroad employee, I have firsthand knowledge of train operations and it is my belief that this proposal reduces, not enhances safety for all involved. <br/>There have been countless examples of technology failure that has led to fatal accidents, including autonomous vehicles and shuttle systems. That number increases when you factor in sabotage and acts of terrorism. Replacing the on-train human element with remote technology does not enhance but diminishes public and employee safety. <br/>It is my understanding that one of the primary responsibilities of the FRA is to ensure that public and employee safety is placed at the forefront of any policy or regulation. If the FRA truly wanted to develop and implement new and emerging technologies that enhance safety and increase railroad operations and efficiencies, then it should start with the enactment of electronic pneumatic brakes on all rail equipment to assist with the ability to slow and stop trains. It should also mandate that two certified crew members must be in the cab of the locomotive to ensure safe and efficient operations. <br/>Based on the aforementioned comments I ask that you deny the implementation and testing of autonomous trains in the United States. <br/>",

Initiating the leasing process prior to the finalization and approval of a new 5-year program is reckless and premature.

The region is home to many important marine animals, including beluga whales, polar bears, seals, walrus, migratory birds, and fish. Offshore drilling in this pristine environment would not only jeopardize sensitive marine ecosystems, but also the communities and species that rely on its continued abundance. There is no proven way to clean up oil spilled in sea ice. Unless and until we can prove that drilling in the Arctic Ocean can be done safely, it is a risk we simply cannot afford to take.<br/><br/>We urge the immediate reconsideration of the irresponsible 2019 Beaufort Sea Lease Sale.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>John Dukovich",

    "docAbstract": "NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 43.  In November 2017, NMFS implemented an emergency rule that set the 2017 commercial and recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for red snapper in the South Atlantic at 42,510 fish.  Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.  The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

And, while a bump stock is in operation, the trigger functions separately every time a round is discharged.<br/><br/>So these regulations are proposing a radical change -- as they effectively define a gun as a machinegun even if the trigger resets for every round that is fired, so long as the finger only pulls the trigger once.<br/><br/>While bump stock devices will now be treated as machineguns under these regulations, they also raise serious questions in regard to AR-15s and other semi-automatic rifles -- as they are now on the brink of being designated as machineguns by the next anti-gun administration.<br/><br/>In the past, one had to fundamentally change the firing mechanism of a semi-automatic firearm to convert it into a fully automatic firearm.<br/><br/>But now according to these regulations, a bump stock is a machinegun -- and it can &quot;readily restore&quot; a semi-auto into a machinegun, simply because the gun owner can effectively fire the weapon continuously with a single pull of the trigger. This would invoke the statutory definition for a rifle, which is classified as a machinegun (26 USC 5845(b)).<br/><br/>It wont matter that a gun which is being bump fired has not been fundamentally altered.  AR-15s will be on the brink of extinction once these regulations go into force.<br/><br/>These regulations dismiss Second Amendment protections, by appealing to the Heller court decision. But the Constitution trumps the Supreme Court -- so when the Second Amendment says that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, any limitation of the right for law-abiding citizens should be treated as unconstitutional.<br/>",

As a railroad employee, I have firsthand knowledge of train operations and it is my belief that this proposal reduces, not enhances safety for all involved.<br/>There have been countless examples of technology failure that has led to fatal accidents, including autonomous vehicles and shuttle systems. That number increases when you factor in sabotage and acts of terrorism. Replacing the on-train human element with remote technology does not enhance but diminishes public and employee safety.<br/>It is my understanding that one of the primary responsibilities of the FRA is to ensure that public and employee safety is placed at the forefront of any policy or regulation. If the FRA truly wanted to develop and implement new and emerging technologies that enhance safety and increase railroad operations and efficiencies, then it should start with the enactment of electronic pneumatic brakes on all rail equipment to assist with the ability to slow and stop trains. It should also mandate that two certified crew members must be in the cab of the locomotive to ensure safe and efficient operations.<br/>Based on the aforementioned comments I ask that you deny the implementation and testing of autonomous trains in the United States.<br/> ",

This sounds like it could easily have the effect of creating medication supply problems for patients who depend on narcotic pain medications to get through day-to-day life. <br/><br/>If those supply problems occur, this action will serve to unnecessarily punish people who have legitimate prescriptions for necessary medications and have had no role in causing the many problems associated with heroin and illegal street opioid overdoses. Many people may feel hopeless about getting treatment; such hopelessness among some patients already has led many of them to take their own lives rather than suffer with pain unnecessarily. The result of the CDC&#39;s &quot;guidance&quot; about opioids has been that many physicians have wrongly dropped medication doses for patients who need them, and have caused many pain patients to suffer.<br/><br/>I strongly urge the DEA to step back from taking actions that result in a reduced ability for pain patients to rely on a supply of the medicines they need.",

    "text": "I write to express my opposition to your March 15, 2018, proposal to weaken the critical protections provided by the 2015 coal ash rule. Below I outline how your proposal will leave communities and our environment vulnerable to toxic coal ash contamination and catastrophic spills.<br/><br/>GUTTING OF GROUNDWATER PROTECTION STANDARDS: I oppose your proposal to weaken the groundwater protection standards. Thousands of massive, aging coal ash pits are leaking heavy metals and toxic pollutants into groundwater. Coal ash dumping has led to water contamination and disastrous coal ash spills. Your proposal to allow states and polluters to use &quot;alternative&quot; groundwater protection standards for determining when cleanup is required will only enable states and polluters to hide the truth about contamination.<br/><br/>GUTTING OF GROUNDWATER MONITORING REQUIREMENTS: The public deserves to know if coal ash dumps in their communities are contaminating groundwater.  The groundwater monitoring requirements are vitally important to the more than 15 million households in the U.S. that rely on private wells for drinking water. It&#39;s unconscionable to allow polluters to decide when groundwater monitoring should stop.  <br/><br/>GUTTING OF CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS: Empowering polluters to avoid cleanup will result in ongoing water contamination. Allowing states or the owners of leaking dumps to determine whether cleanup or closure is necessary is dangerous. Coal ash is toxic, and weakening current standards to match those of town dumps endangers all communities that are near coal ash ponds and landfills. And just because a coal ash dump is no longer receiving waste doesn&#39;t mean that it no longer poses a threat to health and the environment. I oppose your proposal to treat coal ash like household garbage and to reduce the 30-year post-closure monitoring period for dumps that are no longer receiving waste.  <br/><br/>GUTTING OF LOCATION RESTRICTIONS: Prohibitions on dumping coal ash in groundwater, wetlands, floodplains, fault zones, seismic zones and unstable areas are commonsense requirements that prevent water contamination. I oppose your proposal to give states and polluters the discretion to ignore crucial and life-saving location prohibitions (and to do so without public notification or oversight), and reject any extension of the October 2018 deadline to comply with these requirements. <br/><br/>GUTTING CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR LEAKING UNLINED DUMPS: I strongly oppose your proposal to give states and polluters the discretion not to close or retrofit dangerous leaking unlined pits. If these leaking dumps are allowed to operate, they will keep polluting our drinking water and waterways and continue to threaten catastrophic spills. <br/><br/>THE EPAS CURRENT RULEMAKING PROCESS IS FLAWED AND LIMITS PUBLIC INPUT: The EPA has failed to consider widespread evidence of overwhelming groundwater contamination before proposing to weaken the coal ash rule. Industry data shows arsenic in groundwater near ash dumps exceeds federal drinking water standards at most plants. Dangerous levels of lead, thallium, selenium or radium are also very common.  Moreover, 45 days is far too short a time for the public to provide meaningful comment. By failing to hold any field hearings in impacted communities, the EPA is silencing the voices of those directly harmed. <br/><br/>I urge you to protect us from coal ash and preserve all of the minimum protections provided by the 2015 coal ash rule. <br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Christopher Dunn",

The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

    "text": "I write to express my opposition to your March 15, 2018, proposal to weaken the critical protections provided by the 2015 coal ash rule. Below I outline how your proposal will leave communities and our environment vulnerable to toxic coal ash contamination and catastrophic spills.<br/><br/>GUTTING OF GROUNDWATER PROTECTION STANDARDS: I oppose your proposal to weaken the groundwater protection standards. Thousands of massive, aging coal ash pits are leaking heavy metals and toxic pollutants into groundwater. Coal ash dumping has led to water contamination and disastrous coal ash spills. Your proposal to allow states and polluters to use &quot;alternative&quot; groundwater protection standards for determining when cleanup is required will only enable states and polluters to hide the truth about contamination.<br/><br/>GUTTING OF GROUNDWATER MONITORING REQUIREMENTS: The public deserves to know if coal ash dumps in their communities are contaminating groundwater.  The groundwater monitoring requirements are vitally important to the more than 15 million households in the U.S. that rely on private wells for drinking water. It&#39;s unconscionable to allow polluters to decide when groundwater monitoring should stop.  <br/><br/>GUTTING OF CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS: Empowering polluters to avoid cleanup will result in ongoing water contamination. Allowing states or the owners of leaking dumps to determine whether cleanup or closure is necessary is dangerous. Coal ash is toxic, and weakening current standards to match those of town dumps endangers all communities that are near coal ash ponds and landfills. And just because a coal ash dump is no longer receiving waste doesn&#39;t mean that it no longer poses a threat to health and the environment. I oppose your proposal to treat coal ash like household garbage and to reduce the 30-year post-closure monitoring period for dumps that are no longer receiving waste.  <br/><br/>GUTTING OF LOCATION RESTRICTIONS: Prohibitions on dumping coal ash in groundwater, wetlands, floodplains, fault zones, seismic zones and unstable areas are commonsense requirements that prevent water contamination. I oppose your proposal to give states and polluters the discretion to ignore crucial and life-saving location prohibitions (and to do so without public notification or oversight), and reject any extension of the October 2018 deadline to comply with these requirements. <br/><br/>GUTTING CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR LEAKING UNLINED DUMPS: I strongly oppose your proposal to give states and polluters the discretion not to close or retrofit dangerous leaking unlined pits. If these leaking dumps are allowed to operate, they will keep polluting our drinking water and waterways and continue to threaten catastrophic spills. <br/><br/>THE EPAS CURRENT RULEMAKING PROCESS IS FLAWED AND LIMITS PUBLIC INPUT: The EPA has failed to consider widespread evidence of overwhelming groundwater contamination before proposing to weaken the coal ash rule. Industry data shows arsenic in groundwater near ash dumps exceeds federal drinking water standards at most plants. Dangerous levels of lead, thallium, selenium or radium are also very common.  Moreover, 45 days is far too short a time for the public to provide meaningful comment. By failing to hold any field hearings in impacted communities, the EPA is silencing the voices of those directly harmed. <br/><br/>I urge you to protect us from coal ash and preserve all of the minimum protections provided by the 2015 coal ash rule. <br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Chad Empereur",

These two things go together. I work well over 40 hrs a week and have a lot of people depending on me to be effective. I am not, and will never be an addict. This past yr I moved to a different pain dr looking for more aggressive, non-prescription, therapies to add to my meds. The first one botched an epidural steroid injection, another made harsh comments about people who take opioids on just my first and cut my dose in half without any taper. I finally found a dr to be aggressive in procedures and keep me at my regular dose. During the time searching for him, I missed many days of work and lapsed into deep depression because the pain was so bad. Now that Im on my right dose and doing alternative procedures, my quality of life has returned. Please do not do this, do not harm those who just want the same life non-pain pts get to have.

While the suffering may decrease down to a  2/3/4  or spike right back up to 8+ on the 1-10 scale, I am never ever absent pain, frequently enduring crying jags as the pain eats at my body with cramping, spasms &amp; other such torments - be the discomfort low grade or excruciating.

There should be no delays in providing opioid pain medications to patients who legitimately need them. <br/>There is no sure way to estimate the quantity of opioid pain medications needed for the patient population. Chronic illnesses are quite often unpredictableI know this from personal experience of being chronically ill for over twenty years, being a member of multiple chronic pain support groups, and running a chronic illness themed blog with a following of 1393 people for over four years. <br/>I have numerous friends, family, and acquaintances who suffer with chronic pain, and many of these people need and are prescribed opioid pain medication. They take these pain medications as they need themmoreover, most them whom are prescribed these pain medications use them as sparingly as possible. They bear the pain until they can no longer. For many, they must take the pain medication in order to be functional enough to work, care for their children or parents, and in some cases, to be able to care for their own hygiene and other needs. Some of them take opioid pain medications on a regular basis, because otherwise, their daily lives would be unsustainable, and/or the pain would be so great that death would be their only source of relief. <br/>If there is an unexpected increase in the pain of numerous patients, those patients could end up without needed opioid pain medications because the allotted number in existence had already been depleted. When deciding on that number, these potentialities need to be a factor. Epidemics can happen. Natural disasters can happen. Man-made disasters can happen. Consider if, God forbid, there be a major tragedy that resulted in large numbers of seriously injured or ill people in America, and the opioid pain medications available were exhausted in their use for those peoplethis could lead to a multitude of chronic pain patients without access to their legally prescribed pain medications. In the previous paragraph, I mentioned how important opioid pain medications are to the lives of chronic pain patients. Please remember that these patients have the same rights as everyone else and deserve to be able to take care of themselves and their dependents, and to have lives worth living. Please remember that we are humans that need your consideration.<br/>",

The wildfires, hurricanes, and droughts, which I understand are made more extreme and dangerous because of changes in our climate, are hurting our families and neighbors. Scientists who study the climate agree that the carbon dioxide that human activity emitsthrough power plants, cars, trucks and other entities that are important to American jobs, our economy and way of lifeis making climate change worse. If we dont reduce the emissions, it is our children and grandchildren who will feel the impacts.<br/><br/>The good news is that we can cut harmful carbon pollution and still generate the power we need for our homes, businesses and communities. We can also create jobs here at home in a clean and energy efficient economy. The Clean Power Plan is consistent with the transition to clean energy, from sources like wind and solar power, and will provide certainty to power generators/utilities about what is expected of them.  And, as we reduce climate pollution we can help make our air cleaner to breathe across our cities and states. <br/><br/>I urge you to do whats right for Americans and America and keep the Clean Power Plan in place.",

    "text": "I am Dr. Henry S. Cole, President of Henry S Cole Environmental Associates. I am an atmospheric scientist with expertise in the air quality impacts of emission sources. In worked previously as a senior scientist with EPAs Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards and as section chief of its modeling application section.<br/><br/>I would urge EPA to strengthen rather than weaken the current regulations. One urgent need is to amend Section 257.64 by adding a proximity-based site restriction. The evidence demonstrates that those who live, work or go to school are often exposed to airborne coal ash PM2.5, including silica, toxic metals and in some cases radioactive substances. This combination is a dangerous combination especially for children, the elderly and those with chronic respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. <br/><br/>The amendment would prohibit any new CCR disposal facility from locating within 1 mile of any home, school, recreational area, medical facility, or from any other site that may cause public exposure to CCR. No new sites or expansions should be allowed in such areas. Applicants should be required to test for ash on surfaces to which people may be exposed. <br/><br/>Operators of existing sites with a record of repeated offsite releases or code violations should be barred from the further disposal of CCR and should be required to take all closure actions necessary to prevent additional CCR releases. <br/><br/>This amendment is urgent. Consider the many people who testified orally or in writing and who live close to CCR disposal sites. Many expressed concerns that family members are being harmed by excessive exposure to coal ash. <br/><br/>I refer also to the hearing testimony of Vicki Simmons, Moapa Paiute environmental director, and tribal council member. At the April 24, 2018 hearing, Ms. Simmon stated that flooding events caused coal ash from the Reid Gardner Power Plant to wash offsite with deposition of ash on nearby roads, soils, intermittent drainage ways, and other surfaces.  According to Ms. Simmons, fly ash clouds continue to be visible during windy days, despite the power plant&#39;s closing in February 2017. Coal ash present on surfaces can be re-entrained and windblown to areas where the Moapa Paiute, work and play The Moapa homes are located about a mile from the ash disposal sites.<br/><br/>Two years ago, I helped the Moapa Paiute design and implement a study to detect the potential presence of coal ash on indoor surfaces in homes. The results confirm the exposure of Moapa residents to coal ash. Scanning electron microscopy identified of coal ash particles in each of the five homes sampled. Chemical analysis of indoor wipe samples detected significant levels of ChromiumVI a coal ash constituent and a known carcinogen that rarely occurs in nature. <br/> <br/>I strongly recommend that EPA leave strengthen rather than weaken current regulations on the Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals in Landfills and Surface Impoundments. We need stricter regulations to ensure that state agencies and EPA have the enforcement tools critically needed to protect public health, especially where to ash disposal sites are close to those who live, work, play and heal.   <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration. <br/>",

    "text": "As a concerned citizen of Alabama, I respectfully submit the following comments to express my opposition to the proposed rule.<br/><br/>Due to (1) the major threat coal ash poses to public health, (2) the history of unlined and leaking storage ponds in Alabama, and (3) the positive provisions of the 2015 coal ash rule, I oppose the loopholes and flexibilities within this proposed rule. The proposal seeks to roll back the 2015 rule in favor of a scheme that allows power plants to set their own standards and escape accountability. These provisions will harm communities in Alabama and across the country.<br/><br/>Alabama is fraught with cautionary tales about the dangers of coal ash. For decades, the states nine active and inactive power plants have burned coal.  As a result, more than 100 million cubic yards of coal ash exists in Alabama. There are around two dozen coal ash pits; nearly every one is an unlined pond leaking directly into an important river or stream. Coal ash contains carcinogens, toxins, and heavy metals -- all of which have repeatedly contaminated groundwater, private wells, and rivers used for drinking water. The 2018 groundwater monitoring reports showed dangerous contamination surrounding all six coal ash facilities in the state. Additionally, Uniontown, Alabama now stores ash from the 2008 Kingston spill; the town claims serious degradation of health and quality of life thanks to improper storage.<br/><br/>DISCRETIONARY REMEDIATION AND MONITORING: The proposed rule would allow facilities to avoid remediation when contaminated waters are not hydrologically connected to drinking waters, or are polluted by other sources. This scheme allows pollution to go unpunished and fails to protect wildlife and riverine health. Facilities may also evade regular monitoring under certain findings. Knowing how severe contamination is in Alabama, these provisions impose too much unnecessary risk for communities near storage ponds.<br/><br/>WEAKER WATER QUALITY STANDARDS: The current rule requires closure and cleanup when pollutants exceed EPAs water quality standards. The proposal would allow states to work with polluters to set less protective standards. This rollback puts Alabamians at risk by subjecting them to waters in exceedance of what is scientifically and legally safe.<br/><br/>CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS: The proposed rule would allow unlined, leaking ponds to remain open. States and polluters would get to determine whether closure is necessary. Political pressure and economic incentives may jeopardize public safety, causing facilities to stay open despite dangerous pollution.<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION: Certain underrepresented communities in Alabama will be disproportionately affected because of these rollbacks. Due to the complexity of coal ash storage and EPAs accelerated timeline, those communities will largely go unheard.<br/><br/>I oppose the proposed rule, as it will hurt water quality, human health, and riverine ecology. I urge the EPA to protect the environment and public health by withdrawing this proposal.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Richie Sherer<br/>Mobile, AL<br/>",

This notice announces a public process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues relating to the management of Atlantic HMS, with a focus on area-based management measures and weak hook management measures that were implemented to reduce dead discards of bluefin tuna in the pelagic longline fishery.  NMFS would use the scoping process and the draft EIS to develop a regulatory amendment applicable to the pelagic longline fishery.  The scoping process and draft EIS are intended to determine if the suite of existing measures are the best means of achieving the current management objectives and providing flexibility to adapt to fishing variability in the future, consistent with the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA), and other relevant Federal laws.  NMFS is also announcing the availability of a scoping document describing potential measures for inclusion in a future regulatory amendment.  NMFS will hold scoping meetings to gather public comment on potential management options for area based and weak hook requirements.  The time and location details of the scoping meetings are available in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this notice.
