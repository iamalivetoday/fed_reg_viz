I&#39;ve been working for a major USDA NOP organc certifier since 2005. One reason the organic community pursued additional animal welfare standards is because large scale industrial egg laying and broiler chicken facilities are not providing sufficient outdoor access and natural living conditions yet are able to obtain USDA organic certification due to vague and unspecific livestock housing requirements.  Through the work of the National Organic Standards Board, and robust and thoughtful comment periods, the organic sector and the USDA NOP accepted additional, stricter requirements. The notion that AMS can&#39;t allow USDA NOP to exercise through normal and proper functioning of the NOSB and public comment period to develop specific and stricter standards is RIDICULOUS and an insult and injury to our democratic process. <br/>The clarification and specificity provided in the Organic Livestock and Poultry Practices are needed to protect the integrity and reputation of the USDA Organic program. Don&#39;t withdraw these standards, support them and support the organic sector. <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Andrew Black",

    "text": "Under ESA, anyone can submit unlimited petitions to the FWS or NMFS to list species as &quot;threatened&quot; or &quot;endangered.&quot; There is no requirement that the agencies considering these petitions actually count the species populations prior to listing. Thus, there is no real measurable numerical goalpost to justify the agencies&#39; determination that a species deserves to be listed or to justify what would be needed to recover them once they are listed. alternative approaches authorized by ESA to recover listed species, such as use of artificial propagation, are often ignored in favor of scapegoating human activity. Agricultural crop protection products that already undergo extensive regulation under one federal statute must go through consultation with FWS and NMFS, which have little expertise, resulting in consultation delays and litigation, a recent review of  information reveals that more than 30% of all &quot;delisted&quot; species were removed from the ESA list due to data errors, indicating that they should never have been listed in the first place. Even when a species has been deemed recovered, certain Activists groups continue litigating to keep the species on the list. State and tribal representatives have expressed concern that federal proposed recovery timeframes are too lengthy and lack incentives for local, state and tribal entities to delist species,  also,  concerned that federal ESA recovery goals are being set too high, and that they include objectives unrelated to species, such as greenhouse gas emission targets. Litigious groups are petitioning for new species that lack even common names or descriptions, citing from a database called NatureServe, which is not reliable as an accurate or complete source of data. Too often, the &quot;science&quot; included in citizen listing petitions is directly relied upon in the 90-day findings and is then codified as &quot;fact&quot; by the time the 12-month review is completed, and 12-month reviews are sometimes subjected to ad hoc and informal peer reviews that may amount to no more than an email distribution of the document with informal comments received. NMFS created and has used a different means to quantify and classify populations of fish. NMFS characterizes populations of salmon and steelhead as &quot;evolutionary significant units,&quot;116 whereas the FWS utilizes &quot;distinct population segments&quot; as defined by ESA under section 4. that FWS and NMFS have used less-than-transparent processes to ensure that they can list a population of species, even though doubts have been raised about the science underlying a listing proposal<br/>ESA is bowing to out-of-the mainstream and unjustified agendas of certain groups. One Activists in 2010 states &quot;where humans multiply extinction follows, and that the planet cannot continue to sustain both an exponentially growing human population and the healthy abundance of other species.&quot; One biologist went so far as to defend his statement that &quot;the collective needs of non-human species must take precedence over the needs and desires of humans.&quot; Another stated that &quot;humanity threatens to turn the earth into a planet of weeds.&quot; These groups and many conservation biologists believe the primary reason for lawsuits is &quot;to hold the government accountable&quot; on forcing habitat protection and acquisition from private landowners for species.<br/>In 2009, environmentalist activist stated: &quot;When we stop the same timber sale three or four times running, the timber planners want to tear their hair out. They feel like their careers are being mocked and destroyed - and they are. Psychological warfare is a very underappreciated aspect of environmental campaigning.&quot; these statements foster a contentious atmosphere that creates unnecessary conflicts between humans and species, rather than encouraging cooperative efforts to aid species.<br/>",

Decades of failed federal forest management have created unhealthy and overstocked forests, placing 73 million acres of National Forest lands and 397 million acres of forest land nationwide at risk of severe wildfire. Fires are destroying species habitat and ESA itself is creating obstacles that are counter-productive to fighting wildfires, including use of heavily mechanized equipment, use of aerial retardant and restricted use of water due to concerns about potential impacts to other ESA-listed species, such as spruce goose, salmon and others.  State and tribal lands adjoining federal forest lands are increasingly at risk of wildfires partly because of ESA.<br/>The United States is currently 100 percent reliant on foreign sources for 20 mineral commodities and imports the majority of its supply of more than 50 mineral commodities. Mineral commodities that have important uses and face potential supply disruption are critical to American economic and national security. However, a mineral commodity&#39;s importance and the nature of its supply chain can change with time; a mineral commodity that may not have been considered critical 25 years ago may be critical today, and one considered critical today may not be so in the future. Mineral commodities are vital for economic growth, improving the quality of life, providing for national defense, and the overall functioning of modern society. Minerals are being used in larger quantities than ever before and in an increasingly diverse range of applications from telecommunications (cell phones and computers), to renewable-energy generation (wind turbines, solar photovoltaics, and fuel cells), to clean forms of transportation (electric and hybrid cars). Until the mid-20th century, only about 15 metallic elements had much practical use.<br/>For many, the United States currently has no mine production or any significant identified resources and is largely dependent on imports to meet its needs. As a result, the emphasis in this volume is on the global distribution and availability of each mineral commodity. The environmental issues related to production of each mineral commodity, including current mitigation and remediation approaches to deal with these challenges,<br/>since 1973, the United States has continued to become increasingly dependent on imports to meet its demands for an increasing number of mineral commodities. The global demand for mineral commodities is at an all time high and is expected to continue to increase, and the development of new technologies and products has led to the use of a greater number of mineral commodities in increasing quantities to the point that, today, essentially all naturally occurring elements have several significant industrial uses.<br/> Today, nearly all the natural elements in the periodic table of elements have several significant uses. production of many mineral commodities has become concentrated in relatively few countries (for example, tungsten, rare-earth elements, and antimony in China; niobium in Brazil; and platinum-group elements in South Africa and Russia), thus increasing the risk for supply disruption owing to political, social, or other factors. <br/>23 mineral commodities currently among those viewed as important to the national economy and national security of the United States: antimony (Sb), barite (barium, Ba), beryllium (Be), cobalt (Co), fluorite or fluorspar (fluorine, F), gallium (Ga), germanium (Ge), graphite (carbon, C), hafnium (Hf), indium (In), lithium (Li), manganese (Mn), niobium (Nb), platinum-group elements (PGE), rare-earth elements (REE), rhenium (Re), selenium (Se), tantalum (Ta), tellurium (Te), tin (Sn), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), and zirconium (Zr). For a number of these commodities-for example, graphite, manganese, niobium, and tantalumthe United States is currently wholly dependent on imports to meet its needs.<br/>",

    "text": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#39;s job is to assure consumers that organically produced products meet a consistent and uniform standard. Access to outdoors means just that--access to the outdoors. I am writing today to express my strong opposition to the proposed withdrawal of the Organic Livestock and Poultry Practices final rule. I urge you to reconsider this baseless move to weaken the USDA Organic seal. This action is an assault on organic farmers, businesses, and consumers everywhere. <br/><br/>I rely on a strong USDA Organic seal to know that what I am purchasing is backed by a standard that I can trust. I am willing to put my money where my mouth is, but I expect products bearing the USDA Organic seal to meet rigorous standards.<br/><br/>It&#39;s important to me to know that the same strong standard applies to all organic products regardless of where I buy them. I understand that organic farmers and businesses of all types and sizes overwhelmingly support the final rule, and I find it outrageous that you are making this move to withdraw the rule against their recommendation. The withdrawal endorses a few businesses that deny animals access the outdoors and ignores the millions of consumers who rightly equate animals going outside with the organic label.<br/><br/>I want to support the organic farmers and businesses who share my values, but you are putting that in jeopardy. I urge you to please implement the final rule.",

    "text": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#39;s job is to assure consumers that organically produced products meet a consistent and uniform standard. Access to outdoors means just that--access to the outdoors. I am writing today to express my strong opposition to the proposed withdrawal of the Organic Livestock and Poultry Practices final rule. I urge you to reconsider this baseless move to weaken the USDA Organic seal. This action is an assault on organic farmers, businesses, and consumers everywhere. <br/><br/>I rely on a strong USDA Organic seal to know that what I am purchasing is backed by a standard that I can trust. I am willing to put my money where my mouth is, but I expect products bearing the USDA Organic seal to meet rigorous standards.<br/><br/>It&#39;s important to me to know that the same strong standard applies to all organic products regardless of where I buy them. I understand that organic farmers and businesses of all types and sizes overwhelmingly support the final rule, and I find it outrageous that you are making this move to withdraw the rule against their recommendation. The withdrawal endorses a few businesses that deny animals access the outdoors and ignores the millions of consumers who rightly equate animals going outside with the organic label.<br/><br/>I want to support the organic farmers and businesses who share my values, but you are putting that in jeopardy. I urge you to please implement the final rule.",

As a daily caller to the Port of Seattle noise hotline, I appreciate the ease of simply calling the Port, leaving a recorded message, who can then (&amp; hopefully does) share with the FAA.   The problem is that it is not a transparent or publicly accessible system.<br/><br/>The airline industry is only continuing to grow, with a growing population traveling to support it.   Its time to develop an on line, or  phone message system - with transparency and oversight to provide an outlet for not just complaints but suggestions to improve our over burdened airports and the unfortunate residents - like myself - living in the expanding, impacted areas.   Its time to start building new airports - esp in Seattle - to reduce the horrendous noise and health threatening fumes of jet fuel.  Perhaps with infrastructure improvement support we wont need the feedback tool!   Step up FAA and get into the current century!!",

This action is an assault on organic farmers, businesses, and consumers everywhere. <br/><br/>I rely on a strong USDA Organic seal to know that what I am purchasing is backed by a standard that I can trust. I am willing to put my money where my mouth is, but I expect products bearing the USDA Organic seal to meet rigorous standards.<br/><br/>It&#39;s important to me to know that the same strong standard applies to all organic products regardless of where I buy them. I understand that organic farmers and businesses of all types and sizes overwhelmingly support the final rule, and I find it outrageous that you are making this move to withdraw the rule against their recommendation. The withdrawal endorses a few businesses that deny animals access the outdoors and ignores the millions of consumers who rightly equate animals going outside with the organic label.<br/><br/>I want to support the organic farmers and businesses who share my values, but you are putting that in jeopardy. I urge you to please implement the final rule.",

    "text": "By proposing to withdraw the Organic Livestock and Poultry Practices rule, the USDA is ignoring the overwhelming support of the public, consumers and farmers for creating consistent animal welfare standards for organic farms. Big Agriculture wants to continue business as usual, raising animals in inhumane conditions and misleading consumers who pay more for products with the Organic seal, expecting better animal welfare. Do not withdraw the rule. Implement it now to ensure better lives for farm animals and continued respect for the Organic seal.",

Concerns about the appearance of significant influence from special interest and environmental groups in the past Obama administration.   Congress needs to provides a strong foundation upon which America  can build in the fight of special interest groups.  GREATEST PROBLEM AMERICA FACES TODAY IN AMERICA ARE   ENVIRONMENTALISTS,   USING THE Endangered Species Act (ESA)  with the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA)  TO STOP BUSINESS AND HUMANS FROM USING THE RESOURCES ,by   exert more control disguised as helping animals and the environment .

David Valadao (CA-21)    of the House of Representatives  formed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Working Group in May 2013 to examine a variety of questions related to ESA implementation.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Example, CALIFORNA  1998 construction of an elementary school in San Diego was delayed by ESA litigation and FWS mitigation requirements to protect a two-inch shrimp. Construction is finally slated to go forward as a result of an agreement by the school district to spend $5 million in ESA mitigation expenses, all of which will be passed on to local citizens,  EXAMPLE  TEXAS Department of Transportation has been forced to completely redesign the highway project design and submit it for federal approval.  A   spider halted completion of an $11 million water pipeline project.  EXAMPLE MONTANA,  a mining project  has been told by the FWS that it will need to pay for contractors to help them complete a biological opinion related to grizzly bears, without any assurance the project will be approved.  EXAMPLE UTAH,  A rural electric cooperative in Utah was determined that two acres of Utah Prairie Dog habitat were within a 350-foot buffer of the project&#39;s right-of-way. This resulted in a nine-month delay ...... Current implementation of ESA does not clearly identify what is needed to recover and delist species, resulting in a lack of incentives, for state and private conservation, costly mandates, and wasted resources even in light of increased federal funding. ESA punishes private property owners and water rights holders and fails to properly account for huge economic and regulatory burdens that also hinder species conservation. The ESA also advances the agendas of groups seeking land and water acquisition and control. Working Group Conclusion: The ESA promotes a lack of data transparency and science guiding ESA-related decisions, and there are conflicts of interest and bias in &quot;peer review&quot; of federal ESA decisions. ESA is increasingly becoming a tool for litigation and taxpayer-funded attorneys&#39; fees. The Obama Administration&#39;s use of closed-door settlements undermines transparency and involvement of affected stakeholders and drives arbitrary mandates and deadlines that do little to recover species. In 2012, the Department of Justice (DOJ) provided the House Committee on Natural Resources case information on 613 total cases. ESA shuts out states, tribes, local governments, and private landowners not only in key ESA decisions but in actual conservation activities to preserve and recover species. Congress passing the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA). This act, as amended, requires, among other things, that all agencies annually identify and review programs and activities that may be susceptible to significant improper payments.  ",

The same effect can be created by simply pulling a weapon forward while maintaining rearward pressure on the trigger of most any weapon. Having owned and thus fired a rifle with one of these stocks attached in the past I speak from experience. These types of items are strictly for fun to waste ammo with as they are not accurate. The weapon must be held in a manner that greatly reduces accuracy to make the stock &quot;bump fire&quot; back and forth. Do not redefine what is a machinegun based on recent events.

Unless the wording of the law has changed, how is it possible that the ruling on bumpstocks, binary triggers, or similar devices suddenly change?

The ATF directly defined these devices as non machine guns.  How is it they can now be defined in that matter if no law has been altered?  Until the definition of machinegun is altered, the standing on these devices cannot be altered in a manner not within the spirit of current U.S. law. Also, this type of reactionary redefinition of items will place many Americans in a tenuous position.  No one wants to be made a criminal overnight by a past purchase they made years ago.  Arbitrarily changing the law is really not law.  This will cause chaos and panic with innocent citizens branded as potential law breakers.  This will not affect crime rates.  This will, however, create another reason for common folks to distrust and fear the ATF as a reactionary and politically biased organization that works to confuse and obfuscate the clarity of law.  Simply, this will have to be done in Congress, not the ATF, if it is to be constitutional.  Otherwise, any item can be reassessed and rebranded as anything.

First, there is no way you could ban them that there wouldn&#39;t be a product out tomorrow that does the exact same thing...not unless  there was an over reach and banning almost any firearm accessory (which is what this would be).  Second, bump firing cannot be banned...it is something that happens when firing a firearm...even when not trying.  Fire a semi auto from a bench with a loose grip and you will some times bump fire the weapon.  The action is a side effect of recoil. This would be like banning physics...you can&#39;t.  The only way to ban it would be to ban semi autos...which would be an over reach.  Third,  anything (and I mean ANYTHING) can be used to bump fire.  Somebody can grab a stick from the ground, rest one side on shoulder and other side on the finger and make a &quot;bump fire stock&quot;.  A rubber band...belt loop.  The list goes on.  Why try and ban something than can literally be made with no effort...this only hurts people trying to follow the law. Why are we trying to hurt people who only want to comply?  No law that can&#39;t be enforced should be a law.  <br/><br/>So to sum it up...you can only ban bump fire stocks by banning ANYTHING that increases the rate of fire...which means literally every firearm accessory.  If you can&#39;t see this as an over reach of government power...please do all of us a favor.  Quit your job.  Or, be a good American and tell others you will not infringe. That semi autos are protected under the 2nd amendment.

I have not seen any bump fire stocks for sale at any gun shows. And I nor anyone I know owns a bumpfire stock that could possible be exchanged privately nor do I know of any such events. Some online forums may have 3d printer blueprints for download.<br/><br/>22. Typically $99 to $400. Depends on brand and handed-ness. Material doesn&#39;t seem to play a role. It should be noted that 3D printer blueprints are extremely easy to come by. And this is viable option if you don&#39;t want to wait a few weeks for your order to process(and it&#39;s cheaper).<br/><br/>23. Bump stock devices are purely a &quot;range toy&quot; by any view. It simply a device that brings bumpfiring(traditionally done at the hip with a belt loop on a pair of pants) up to the shoulder for better accuracy.  These devices give newer gun owners the ability to shoot a firearm to near full auto speeds. I don&#39;t know a single firearm owner that hasn&#39;t at least wanted fire a machine gun at least once in their life time. Since &#39;86 ban on newer registered machine guns these devices sort of filled that niche. *They would have never have been created if new machine guns could be registered*(thus that person would have to pass a stringent background check). <br/><br/>I just wanted add here at the end that these devices are in no way automatic. The following is the definition of a machine gun (MG) per the 1934 NFA:<br/><br/>&quot;Any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.&quot;<br/><br/>Bumpstocks are devices that help manipulate the trigger fast but do not do so automatically.The user is still only getting one shot with one action of the trigger.  Recoil is what device is taking advantage of. The user is simply taking the technique of bump firing (which can be done 100% without these devices) and maximizing its effectivity. It is still possible to bumpfire above the hip with practice",

National environmental groups, that only a few years prior to Obama EPA , praised natural gas as the bridge fuel to a clean environment, but last 8 years changed to oppose .

Congress should consider steering the U.S. out of the natural gas crisis and back toward a competitive and vibrant economy. It is critical that Congress act to keep American resource production from snowballing into economy-wide destruction and repeal the burdens of regulations.<br/>Power generators expanded their demand for natural gas by 36% over the period 1997-2000.

In a June 2005 report the State of California consumed approximately 6 to 10 billion feet of natural gas per day. If California were a country, it would have ranked as the tenth largest user of natural gas worldwide. Natural gas is regarded as the cleanest burning fossil fuel and therefore should be preferred over other sources, so why is it not championed by environmental groups? Instead , they had significant and detrimental impacts on the U.S. gas and oil economy as a whole, and consumers and workers specifically. <br/>In an industrialized and globally competitive world, energy use represents a very real and fixed cost of doing business and more fundamentally, of life. Consumers and businesses have moderated and may continue to moderate their energy use marginally, but in the end, they require energy for survival. More simply, energy is not a luxury; it is a necessity.<br/>The Congressional Joint Economic Committee found that, &quot;environmental laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s, and their subsequent regulations, encouraged utilities to use clean burning natural gas. during this time 90 percent of new power plants were gas-fired in large part as a result of government environmental policies. Some states&#39; percentage of natural gas-dependent electricity was closer to 100 percent, and many of those states were starving for more natural gas. For example all of California&#39;s power plants from 1998-2005 had been natural gas-fired facilities. The U.S. have abundant natural gas resources with trillions of cubic feet , and finding more by the month. America is not running out of natural gas, and it is not running out of places to look for natural gas. America is running out of places where companies were allowed to look for gas. California&#39;s Energy Commission in 2005 report concluded that natural gas has allowed power plant developers &quot;to meet local air quality regulations that implement the federal Clean Air Act.&quot; then the Environmental activist turned against this clean energy, makes no since.<br/>Natural gas has been regarded as the ideal fossil fuel for multiple uses- from electricity generation to manufacturing, in part because of its efficiency, in part because of its relative cleanliness, and in part because of its relatively low delivered cost. For many years, natural gas was a wise and easy choice; America is blessed with an abundant supply and gas burns cleaner and is considered by some to be more environmentally preferable to other fuels. That abundant supply translated to low prices, and those low prices helped fuel a strong and vibrant economy. Most people probably do not realize the importance that natural gas plays in their daily lives. Natural gas is a principal feedstock to several industries including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, the pulp and paper, steel, and fertilizer industries. The most dramatic finding was that U.S. federal laws and policies in Obama administration with regulatory burden had contributed in large measure to the nation&#39;s natural gas crisis. Federal environmental policies have prevented a sufficient and corresponding increase in supply of natural gas. These conflicting federal policies have created an artificial barrier for the market.<br/>After quite literally placing middle income taxpayers on the brink of going out of business the government current is acknowledging the unfortunate fact -we are indeed experiencing an energy regulation crisis from the past administration.<br/>",

    "text": "The core problem to be solved which checks all the blocks on the punchlist are not simply reducing emissions per se but making emissions reduction compliance a self-financing mechanism which reinforces the stability and economic reliability of existing power generation activities through emissions-compliant retrofits.  There is no silver-bullet &quot;disruptive innovation&quot; imminent as a solution but rather applying tried and true hydrocarbon processing methods within the guidelines of industry specifications and standards on an incremental non-disruptive  &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; basis. <br/><br/>Making electricity plus chemicals is a primary component responsible for our nation&#39;s economic growth and stability. DuPont de Nemours, Monsanto, Dow, BASF U.S.A. and other chemical giants of the last century advance the renown of their present world market standing through applying principles of chemical manufacture developed during that epoch. Crafting strategies for coal plant stack gas-derived conversion to coal-to-chemicals co-production therefore is but a modern continuation of a time hallowed industrial tradition.<br/><br/>This coal-based technology is by no means obsolete nor Luddite but rather well-proven and current whilst meeting new E.P.A. regulatory criteria. Three of many American exemplary reference coal plants producing both electrical power and chemicals (to include high-grade carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery projects) are available for your technical and fiscal review:<br/><br/>    http://www.dakotagas.com<br/><br/>    http://www.eastman.com/Company/Sustainability/features/Environment/Pages/Cogeneration.aspx<br/><br/>    http://saskpowerccs.com/<br/><br/>The Allam process also is prototyped as a pilot plant and is but one step from full deployment commissioning as being commercially viable by the above-stated criteria.<br/><br/>The task of duplicating these thermal plant successes through converting power plants, either in whole or in part, can be divided into three preparatory components.<br/><br/>    Development of a fully-costed co-production retrofit business plan specific to thermal plants which would include a local and national co-product marketing strategy and timeline, including a co-product distribution, logistics and storage breakdown. This is done through developing multiple scenarios then selecting the configuration that works best relative to overall corporate and shareholder goals;<br/><br/>    Competitive selection through the RFP mechanism of an EPC contractor to engineer, procure and construct the envisioned plant. Happily many EPC&#39;s in the hydrocarbon processing plant retrofit construction industry have the proven capability and experience in running the finished plant whilst training your staff to take over the EPC&#39;s operations function at a pre-agreed point in time. This process is called BOT (build-operate-transfer); and<br/><br/>    Crafting of the financial mechanism for making your retrofit coal-to-chemicals co-production facility a reality.<br/><br/>Gasification of existing thermal plant emissions and slag on an onsite add-on is also a co-production option which routinely pencils out if adopted.  As an example, carbon dioxide as a chemical commodity is the most highly-traded industrial gas worldwide for exactly the purpose described:  making chemical products.  Here is a full listing from UNIDO&#39;s CommTrade records of volume of trade in industrial carbon dioxide (not reduction offsets but solely the physical commodity) for the years 2015 and 2016).  Individual nations&#39; checmial industries can and would take all the CO2 captured that thermal power plants produce:<br/><br/>http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=inorganic+chemicals&amp;d=ComTrade&amp;f=_l1Code%3a29%3byr%3a2015%3bcmdCode%3a281121&amp;c=2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12&amp;s=_crEngNameOrderBy:asc,yr:desc,_l2Code:asc&amp;v=1<br/><br/>There are hundreds of coal and biomass gasification facilities available worldwide for inspection and review, many of which having been fully operational since the 1960&#39;s.  Here is a global listing of these facilities:<br/><br/>http://www.gasification-syngas.org/resources/map-of-gasification-facilities/<br/><br/>If carbon capture is the primary option under consideration, these plants as well can make use of that product and pay well for this surplus economic asset which is now going to waste except within the framework of the hydrocarbon processing community.<br/><br/>For states to make best use of this surplus asset deployment opportunity, it remains for the mindset to be developed by state governments which treats of this priceless chemical commodity for what it is: an essential part of the world&#39;s chemical industry.  A partnership between the Edison Electric Institute and the American Institute for Chemical Engineering for each state is in order, organised  similar to the German Chemical Parks system:<br/><br/>https://www.chemicalparks.com/chemical-parks/list-of-chemical-parks.html<br/><br/>America&#39;s chemical industry is equal to the challenge.

    "text": "As it currently stands, I oppose the proposed tip regulation rule of (RIN) 1235-AA21. This could change with revisions.<br/><br/>Firstly, I am certainly in favor of ensuring that all workers receive the minimum wage. This rule would ensure such a thing, and I approve because it would give waitstaff more opportunity to cope with sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior from customers. Currently, waitstaff have to suffer from such behavior because confronting it means they are likely to lose tips and thus not have enough money for living expenses.<br/><br/>Despite this, it is important to point out that the current minimum wage is not a living wage, since the minimum wage has not increased in proportion to how living expenses have increased. Living wage can be better understood here: http://livingwage.mit.edu/pages/about. For example, in my state and others, the minimum wage is not a living wage. There are people who have to take multiple jobs and work more than 40 hours a week just to pay for living expenses (as I&#39;m sure you know, 40 hour work weeks are INTENDED to be long enough to pay for basic living expenses). This is important to consider in relation to tips.<br/><br/>If there are enough compassionate customers, tips may offer a service worker the opportunity to make a living wage. This is difficult to ensure, since the minimum tip wage is only $2.13 and making up the difference relies entirely on the customers (rather than the employers, as seems more appropriate). But there is nevertheless an opportunity that other workers are not necessarily afforded. If waitstaff can make the usual minimum wage as well as tips, they are MORE likely to make a living wage. And with the tip pool suggested by this proposal, enough tips could possibly allow other restaurant staff could make a living wage as well. Until the federal minimum wage is increased to a living wage, this proposal may help restaurant workers make a living wage.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, as it currently stands, this proposal needs revision. Firstly, there is a legitimate risk that the money can be pocketed by corrupt employers. Nothing restricts what an employer can do with the money, and thus the tip pool could be put forward to help only the individual employer rather than all of the employees. Corruption exists, and without regulations to keep it in check this proposal CANNOT reliably work as I have suggested.<br/><br/>Secondly, it is important to point out the possible drawbacks of forcing a tipping pool. Tips work as an incentive for waitstaff to provide good service, and the knowledge that their service will not be rewarded may lead to a decrease in work performance. Waitstaff are expected to be polite and appropriate in order to earn tips, while other restaurant workers are not encouraged in the same way. A tipping pool means that the waitstaff&#39;s performance is the deciding factor for other workers earning additional pay, and they may be disinclined to work hard if they are not earning for themselves and/or would be paying the wages for rude co-workers. This risks hurting not only the business, but the opportunity for the workers to make living wages.<br/><br/>Even if you ensure that employers do not steal wages, the second problem of decreased incentive exists. To fix this, the proposal should consider implementing a proportional tip pool. The employer should not take from the tipping pool if they do not do day-to-day work in the restaurant like their employees, and the portion of a tipping pool an employee gets should be dependent upon their existing basic wage (less for people who make a larger basic wage, as they need less to make a living wage). The waitstaff, who are the ones performing the service that ultimately decides whether a customer gives tips, should be given bigger parts of the tipping pool than back-of-the-house workers. This provides waitstaff the personal incentive to work hard, and the other workers the incentive to be polite and appropriate to one another so that the waitstaff feel more at ease with some of their hard work going to their co-workers. THIS could actually be beneficial to the business and the workers.<br/><br/>Personally, I believe that tips should be what they are intended: The customer commending the waitstaff for excellent service. It would also be nice for the customer to have an opportunity to tip the other staff (e.g. cooks, etc.). Additionally, a living wage needs to be ensured for all the hard working citizens of the United States. But since the federal minimum wage does not amount to a living wage, I can see how this proposal could potentially help restaurant workers pay for their living expenses. This will NOT happen, however, until the proposal is revised so that the benefits go the workers instead of benefiting only the employer.",

    "text": "The USDA has announced its intention to end regulations requiring the humane treatment of animals for foodstuffs that receive an organic label. This is unethical and wrong. Consumers have expectations of what &quot;organic&quot; means, and farms profit financially from these expectations. <br/><br/>By allowing farms to use the &quot;organic&quot; lucrative label regardless of their raising practices, this decision threatens to remove incentives for humane farming and make it more difficult for those who do raise animals humanely to compete with factory farms.&quot;<br/><br/>I will no longer purchase &quot;organic&quot; meat if the regulations requiring humane treatment of animals disappear. America should be ashamed of itself.",
