These are valuable landscapes rich with history and recreation opportunities including canyoneering, climbing, hiking, backpacking, sightseeing and just plain getting in touch with nature that are unparalleled even in the treasures of Utah&#39;s National Parks. Preserving the desert and its wildlife, clean air, dark skies, and ancient artifacts is good for humanity at large and also for the economic interests of regional communities that benefit from tourism to GSENM. Please keep the Monument as it is, for us and for those who will come after us. <br/>Thank you, <br/>Aron Ralston",

Many visitors from other countries travel here to be inspired and amazed. <br/><br/>During a visit to the Grand Canyon, I heard French, German, and Slavic languages. Later at lunch I listened to a table of French speakers pouring over their travel book planning their next stop. I thanked them for their visit and they said this was their third trip to American, and they were effusive with their excitement about what they were seeing. <br/><br/>On another trip to Jackson, Wyoming, we hiked behind a German couple who were so excited to see the magnificent scenery and the experience of  wilderness that is more difficult to find and access in Europe. <br/><br/>In addition to my experience with international visitors in the parks, I have visited national parks and monuments across the country from New England to California. Many of these parks provide economic benefits to the surrounding area. <br/><br/>On the local level, I have suppported environmental conservation both actively, by helping to maintain hiking trails in Montana and Colorado, and financially, by contributions to local conservation organizations.

The Everglades would be condos. <br/><br/>Our National Parks and Monuments are American royalty. They are sacred lands that everyone can enjoy. Our public lands do not care if you are rich or poor, black or white, male or female. Our National Monuments are &quot;For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People.&quot; All people. Once our sacred lands are gone we cannot get them back.<br/><br/>I implore you to please protect our sacred lands. Thank you Secretary Zinke.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Noah Thompson<br/>  Nampa, ID 83687",

DO NOT RIP THIS WONDERFUL PLACE FROM THE DESERVING HANDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!!!  While locals might be upset that they are no longer the only official beneficiaries of this land, they also need to understand that this land has always been the federal government&#39;s, never &#39;theirs&#39; as many seem to think.  This stunning landscape has been held in trust for the American people by the federal government, and any move to rescind these protections or to open the land to further exploitation by ranching and extractive industries is a direct and evil-hearted decision against the American people.  Furthermore, there is neither a precedent nor right for an executive or department to reduce the designations and protections established by earlier presidents.  The entire reason that the Executive is only given the power to create, not destroy, public land designations is so that this important asset of the citizenry is not threatened by the capricious political winds of Washington.  This land was designated to be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of all Americans, and measures such as this to reduce protections for the benefit of short-sighted resource extraction are a clear and immutable championing of industry over the good of the American people.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the supposed industry that opening these lands up to development is a mirage.  These measures are intended to open lands up for resource extraction under the banner of creating jobs and economic stability.  However, the entire west is littered with dying small towns whose rapid decline testifies to the short-term nature of extraction industry (such as Globe, AZ or Butte, MT).  Furthermore, these industries rarely bring jobs to the people in the area.  Instead, we see trends such as those seen in the Bakken oilfields; Texas and Oklahoma workers brought in, crime and violence dramatically increasing, and skyrocketing of land prices that crowd locals out.  No part of this process helps local residents create a robust and sustainable economy.  <br/><br/>I am a proud resident of Arizona and the larger mountain West, and it shakes me to my core to see politicians openly entertaining this grand theft of such a wonderful place from the American people.  Please say NO to this elitist corporate plan to swindle the American people out of their heritage, and advise for no reductions in the GSENM.  Thank you.",

The guidance provides updated received levels, or acoustic threshold levels, based on the best available science, above which individual marine mammals are predicted to experience changes in their hearing sensitivity (either temporary or permanent) for all underwater anthropogenic sound sources. This guidance is intended to be used by NOAA analysts and managers and other relevant user groups and stakeholders, including other federal agencies, when seeking to determine whether and how their activities are expected to result in particular types of impacts to marine mammals via acoustic exposure. Although NOAA has updated the acoustic threshold levels from those previously used, and these changes may necessitate new methodologies for calculating impacts, the application of the thresholds in the regulatory context under applicable statutes (Marine Mammal Protection Act, Endangered Species Act, and National Marine Sanctuaries Act) remains consistent with past NOAA practice."

During your confirmation hearing you said you grew up near Glacier National Park, knew the personal value of the park,  and saw first hand the effects of climate change on that special place. This gave me hope when you were confirmed as the secretary of the interior. Despite our differences in political party, we shared a common desire to preserve our parks and consider what we can do about climate change. <br/><br/>The same extends to national monuments. I spend many of my weekends exploring national parks, monuments, and forests. I&#39;m incredibly grateful that such land has been preserved for use by the American people. Withdrawing protection or even reducing the regulations and protections for the national monuments is a huge blow, not just to the environment within that monument, but to the American people such as myself. National monuments are land set aside for everyone to enjoy. Reducing their protection to serve the interests of a few small groups is a disservice to the American people. Please maintain the integrity of America&#39;s national monuments so that all Americans can enjoy them the way your family enjoyed Glacier NP.

These are special places set apart for much more then being &quot;pretty places.&quot;  Our economies depend heavily on tourism to these great places, our native nations call these places sacred heritage sites that have thousands of years of traditions still being practiced today, and for those of us lucky enough to live around these places, we call it home.  If you have not visited these great places i invite you out here and hope you do before making any decision upon thier behalf.  Make sure to bring a camera!  I am asking strongly that you keep these places as they are, set apart for the preservation and limited use of us, the US citizens.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Eric Retterbush<br/>  Flagstaff, AZ 86001",

    "text": "The Red Wolf Recovery Plan called for the reintroduction of wolves into at least three areas within the wolf&#39;s historic range. Each population should be allowed to grow numerically large enough for the natural evolutionary processes to work within the species and remove threats of extinction. This could be accomplished by achieving three wild populations totaling approximately 220 wolves.<br/><br/>The wild population in eastern North Carolina has been the most successful of all wild reintroductions of red wolves, reaching 130 wolves in 2005. This site--as well as others--allows for the eventual establishment of a healthy metapopulation, featuring interactions between populations to achieve the necessary exchange of genetic material critical to species restoration and eventual delisting. Increased genetic diversity from additional reintroductions will further act to mitigate inbreeding depression associated with small isolated populations. Expansion of the current wild program is also of critical importance as a genetic buffer against disease. <br/><br/>Tools for population management must include controlling coyote hybridization and gunshot mortality, as well as pup fostering, which is a significant population management tool for ensuring red wolf recovery. The threat of hybridization is minimized by promoting an environment that bolsters red wolf populations and supports encounters between red wolves. Establishing sterile placeholder coyote individuals in the landscape to reduce hybridization can work, and needs to be part of any revised recovery strategy. Disease monitoring and prevention plans are also needed. Perhaps most importantly, the red wolf program needs a 10(j) rule that prioritizes red wolf conservation and recovery instead of allowing landowners to kill wolves, especially when nonlethal methods of avoiding conflict are widely available, and the population is so vulnerable. <br/><br/>According to Sparkman, Hinton, Bohling, Waits, and other experts on coyote/red wolf hybridization, in larger populations, red wolves will likely have less incidence of hybridization with other species of canids, as red wolves will have a larger pool of available mates. In addition, the Red Wolf Adaptive Management Plan--including targeted control of coyotes and hybrids and release of sterilized coyotes to hold territories until red wolves move into the territory or are reintroduced--was extremely effective at limiting introgression of coyote genes into the red wolf population. In fact, the US Fish and Wildlife Service itself concluded in its last five-year review of the red wolf: &quot;We have effectively reduced interbreeding and coyote gene introgression using the adaptive plan and associated non-invasive techniques, all with assistance from scientists on the Red Wolf Recovery Implementation Team.&quot;<br/><br/>A revised 10(j) rule must truly provide for the conservation of red wolves. The current implementation of the rule has allowed for the dramatic decline in the species in recent years, showing that greater protections are needed. Gunshot mortality and removals from private lands have become leading threats to the species; the lenient standards currently in place, intended to bolster landowner support for the program, must be balanced against the needs of the species.",

On a monthly, sometimes weekly, basis my family and I explore, hike, bike, ski, raft and camp on public lands, especially Canyonlands National Park, Arches National Park, Colorado National Monument and White River National Forest and the surrounding BLM lands.  We moved our family from Northern Illinois to Colorado after a memorable trip to Moab, Utah, and its surrounding area (including what is now Bears Ears).  These lands belong to the American people, not local ranchers, gas/oil interests or real estate developers.   <br/>My children, now teenagers, watched TV in abject horror as groups of armed thugs such as Ammon Bundy claimed, at gunpoint, that these lands were best managed by local authorities.    These lands are not theirs, nor are the decisions as to what to do with these lands.  I agree that some lands can be efficiently used to mineral resources such as gas, oil and cattle, but not lands that have unsurpassed beauty and ecological significance (not to mention cultural value to Native Americans).  <br/>We have heard from gas, oil and ranch interests, as well as their lobbyists.

The EPA safeguards clean air, clean water, and ecosystem health for the whole country and Americans&#39; health and lives depend on it. I also strongly support the Paris Climate Accord and the Clean Power Plan, and vehemently oppose Scott Pruitt&#39;s attempts to gut climate research from the EPA. <br/><br/>Man-made climate change is a scientific consensus, which means it is true whether or not Mr. Trump or Mr. Pruitt choose to believe it. There are thousands of peer-reviewed articles that support this consensus with irrefutable evidence, and the majority of Americans want to see climate change addressed and mitigated. Acting to stop climate change will create jobs and be a boon to the economy- the Clean Power Plan is projected to yield up to $20 billion in climate benefits, plus public health benefits of $14 - $34 billion each year, and give a major boost to the clean energy industry that employs 2.5 million Americans, and growing. Additionally the Clean Air Act alone prevents more than 160,000 premature deaths and 1.7 million asthma attacks  every year  delivering up to $90 in public health benefits for every dollar invested (source: NRDC).<br/><br/>This should not be a partisan issue- there are groups of Republican legislators who want to address climate change, and even the Department of Defense has described climate change as a &quot;threat multiplier&quot; that will threaten the national security of the United States. I&#39;ve attached a recent article from the Annual Review of Public Health titled &quot;Climate change and collective violence&quot; that describes the social impacts that climate change will have on our society if it is not brought under control. <br/><br/>The authors state &quot;Increased temperatures and extremes of precipitation with their associated consequences, including resultant scarcity of cropland and other key environmental resources, are major pathways by which climate change leads to collective violence. Public health professionals can help prevent collective violence due to climate change (a) by supporting mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, (b) by promoting adaptation measures to address the consequences of climate change and to improve community resilience, and (c) by addressing underlying risk factors for collective violence, such as poverty and socioeconomic disparities.&quot;<br/><br/>The EPA needs to support its scientists in their research and follow the data to create sound public policy built on scientific consensus and evidence. The EPA also needs to stop gagging its scientists and purposefully censoring their research and scrubbing climate change data and policy from its website. This is shameful and deceitful.<br/><br/>Republicans can and should claim this issue as their own and start listening to scientists! Let the EPA do its work to protect public health and the environment from pollution and climate change. We don&#39;t have much time left, but it&#39;s still not too late to let science, evidence, and facts lead us to rational action.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Glenda Mahoney<br/><br/>Illustration Editor at Annual Reviews<br/>A nonprofit scientific publisher<br/>(these views are my own)<br/>www.annualreviews.org<br/>(650)843-6653",

    "text": "As a PTA member, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Education&#39;s (ED) revised state template for the consolidated state plan under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). National PTA is the oldest and largest volunteer child advocacy association in the United States, with congresses in all 50 states, Washington DC, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Europe. Since 1897, National PTA has been a strong advocate and a reputable resource for empowering all families to effectively engage in their child&#39;s education. <br/><br/>The enactment of ESSA and the ongoing implementation process of the law has allowed parents and families more opportunities to be involved in their child&#39;s education at the school, district and state level. The statutory requirement that parents be &quot;meaningfully consulted&quot; as stakeholders in the development of state and local education plans will allow us to become closer to making every child&#39;s potential a reality.  <br/><br/>Our members are committed to educating and empowering all families to be active participants in the state and local implementation of ESSA to ensure equity and opportunity for all students. We are extremely disappointed that stakeholder engagement is no longer prioritized in the revised consolidated state plan template. The removal of the requirement for states to explain how they have engaged stakeholders undermines Section 1111(a)(1)(A) of ESSA, which requires state education agencies to meaningfully consult a wide variety of stakeholders that are vital to the implementation and success of the law. <br/><br/>The U.S. Department of Education must require a description of stakeholder engagement in its ESSA consolidated state plan template, including who was consulted, what they were consulted on and how stakeholder feedback was incorporated into the state plan. Furthermore, it is imperative that states explain to all stakeholders-especially parents and families-how students and schools will be impacted under the new state accountability system. <br/><br/>Authentic and robust stakeholder engagement must occur at all levels-the state, school district and school-so that there is transparency and accountability for the educational system and opportunities provided to our nation&#39;s youth.   <br/><br/>State education agencies (SEAs) should provide the necessary support and oversight of local education agency (LEA) plans to ensure authentic stakeholder engagement also occurs at the school district level. Within the description of stakeholder engagement in the state plan, the state should describe how it will provide guidance and best practices for stakeholder engagement so that school districts can create strong LEA plans that meet the needs of all students in their communities.  <br/><br/>Parents and their children are consumers of our nation&#39;s public education system, and parents are essential partners in education. However, they haven&#39;t always been included at the decision-making table, which has caused confusion, mistrust and backlash when new initiatives-whether at the federal, state and local level-have been considered and implemented. We have learned from the implementation of other education initiatives that engaging all stakeholders-especially parents-is critical, not optional. Stakeholders, particularly parents, play a critical role in the successful implementation of ESSA and ensuring that all children receive a quality education by providing valuable input and holding states and districts accountable.  <br/><br/>It is imperative that the consolidated state plan template requires a clear and thorough description of how stakeholders were engaged to develop the state plan. Through meaningful consultation of all stakeholders, states and school districts can provide a blueprint to improve education, provide educational equity for all children and make sure every child is prepared for long-term success through ESSA. <br/><br/>I am committed to educating and empowering all parents and families to be engaged in their child&#39;s education, and specifically be involved in the ESSA implementation process. Our association values our strong and long-standing relationship with ED and we look forward to continuing to collaborate to make every child&#39;s potential a reality.",

    "text": "There are now a few commercial tourist boats like the pirate ship and freedom sailboat, that I have seen make the bridge open and stay open while they just turn around and head back through for sightseeing. This is an abuse and extremely disrespectful to tie up traffic for even longer and not for any &quot;legitimate navigational need&quot;! They do this at the worst rush hour times. Vessels should not be allowed to pass back and forth during the same bridge opening.  If you don&#39;t need to be on the other side then you don&#39;t need for cars to wait for you to motor around twice!  Once this backs up traffic downtown then it never recovers until several hours later. Vehicle traffic is becoming worse with each passing season and that on-demand bridge openings are contributing to vehicle traffic backups on the Bridge of Lions.  For this reason I support the proposed modification of extending the twice an hour draw opening period from 7:00am to 9:00pm daily, and preclude the draw bridge from opening at 3:30pm on weekends and federal holidays.",

    "text": "Dear Jennifer Jessup, I am writing in support of the addition of a new classification for people from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region by the U.S. Census Bureau on the 2020 Census. I call on your support for the testing of MENA as an ethnic classification. People from the MENA region identify with many racial backgrounds. Unfortunately, no designation currently exists on the Census forms for individuals who trace their roots to the MENA region. We effectively remain an &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; community which has left us undercounted and underrepresented. A MENA classification will also allow many sub-national minority communities (i.e. Assyrians, Chaldeans, Kurds, Berbers, etc.) that originate from this region to self-identify. I believe that accurate and inclusive data collection on the MENA population in the U.S. will serve as a resource to policy makers, federal and local officials, public institutions, service organizations and the public, in assessing the status and needs of these communities. Thank you for your contributions in the development of this new category.",

The favourable EA was sound and based on a thorough and appropriate analysis. The transgenic strain does not express any known toxins or allergens. Further, the strain is self-limiting as all of the female offspring of the transgenic males die. Thus the strain poses negligible risk for the environment and human health. The transgenic strain could be a valuable addition to current control tactics for this devastating plant pest that has become resistant to many chemical insecticides.",

The resulting deterioration of our resources would only mean that we would then have to mitigate the effects by greater dependence on more chemicals and other types of man-made support systems, thereby supporting businesses in making a profit off of the results. There would also be greater health costs for individuals, many who could not afford it, by being exposed to food and water, as well as air, that was unhealthy. The long term results of this action would only benefit those businesses who made a short term profit from the relaxing of regulations. Over the years the harmful effects would increase exponentially, leaving the devastation for future generations, after those who had made the original decisions to loosen our regulations, as well as those who profited by that action, were dead and did not have to live with the results of their greed.<br/><br/>Thank you for your conscientious consideration concerning the evaluation of existing regulations.",

    "text": "As the evaluation of existing regulations unfolds, I believe each regulation warrants careful consideration regarding how and why it was drafted, the ways in which it has / has not been effective, and the implications for modifying or removing it.  In this vein, this public comment opportunity is greatly limited by its lack of specificity: all regulations are being lumped together and commented on as a whole.  While regulations can be conflicting, burdensome and/or ineffective, the degree that this is occurring depends on the terms of each individual regulation and, as such, ***public comment should be made possible for planned changes or termination of individual (or at least bundles of related) regulations.***<br/><br/>As it relates to the EPA, a regulation may impair the ability of one industry to cheaply manufacture a product, thus eliminating or inhibiting job creation, but this does not account for the potential of that regulation to retain jobs in another industry (e.g. those relying on fisheries impaired by dumping of pollutants into waterways), nor the public health or the inherent value of supporting resilient ecosystems.  Therefore, it is paramount in the evaluation of a regulation that the reviewer ask for whom is cost-benefit analysis being performed?  Is it the GDP, specific industries, or for the citizens living in the region?  How short-term vs. long-term are the goals for improving quality of life, and to what extent are we willing to loosen regulations that would allow degradation of natural systems and public health for immediate wealth generation?<br/><br/>In summary, I implore that public comment be available for proposed changes to each set of regulations, and that the framework for evaluating a regulation give importance to society over any interest group.<br/><br/>- Greg Richardson (US citizen; CA &amp; WI)",
