    "text": " I support the National Organic Standards Board&#39;s motion to approve the two-art proposal to eliminate the Incentive to Convert Native Ecosystems to Organic Production.<br/><br/>We have lost so much native prairie, our native ecosystem, and non-native grassland pasture in the Midwest where I have lived most of my life.  The consequences have been destruction of habitat for native prairie wildflowers and grassland birds and animals and the pollution of streams from field runoff.  It&#39;s become a desert of corn and soybeans.   U.S. agricultural policies should not encourage any more plow down of native prairie or even non-native grasslands. <br/>    <br/>That&#39;s why I&#39;m writing to urge the National Organic Standards Board to fully support the two part proposal that would stop encouraging landowners to destroy this habitat in order to plan organic crops. <br/><br/> First the term &quot;native ecosystem&quot; should be defined so that it means certain plants, plants known to thrive in native prairies that are found on land that a farmer may want to plow down and plant.  And second, even though   farmers are encouraged by the higher prices organic crops bring to plow down prairie grasslands and put organic crops into production, they should be required to wait 10 years before that land can be certified organic.  This definition and 10 year wait will discourage land owners from ruining more native prairie grasslands.  The land can still be used to graze animals and be productive.<br/><br/>",

    "text": "As a recreational angler and Texas resident, I am in support for the proposed Exempted Fishing Permit (EFP) that would allow Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) to manage both the charter for-hire and private recreational angler sectors. The inclusion of the charter for-hire sector in this EFP confirms that TPWD does not play favorites within the recreational fishing community and provides all anglers ample opportunities to participate in the fishery. Separating anglers by what vessel they fish on only complicates fisheries management and creates unnecessary divisions among anglers.<br/><br/>The levels of diversity in data collection, management strategies, quota monitoring, and season openings and closings that will be explored in the EFPs by all Gulf States should be a good indicator of the promise of state management. I feel that these EFPs will lead to better management of Gulf red snapper.<br/> ",

If granted, the EFPs would authorize the applicants, with certain conditions, to allow red snapper caught by the private angling component and/or charter vessel/headboat (for-hire) component to be landed within certain time periods determined by the respective states.  Red snapper landings would be monitored by the respective states and the state seasons would close when a state\u2019s assigned quota is reached, or projected to be reached.  These studies, to be conducted in the exclusive economic zone of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), are intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of Gulf state management of recreationally caught red snapper."

    "text": "As a registered dietitian (RD) and board-certified specialist in oncology nutrition (CSO) working in a CoC-accredited cancer center, I propose that nutrition screening with timely and appropriate nutrition intervention by qualified RDs be considered integral to OCE.  <br/><br/>When nutrition screening is implemented at critical points during cancer treatment and follow-up, there is opportunity to identify and address nutrition-related problems early, having the potential to prevent costly complications associated with poor outcomes.  Timely and appropriate nutrition intervention by a qualified nutrition professional is a cost-effective investment that should be considered crucial in any comprehensive cancer center.  <br/><br/>Early identification of nutrition problems with appropriate intervention has the potential to prevent, minimize, or delay malnutrition.  Patients with poor nutrition status (malnutrition) are more likely to experience breaks in treatment, ED visits, hospital admissions, treatment-related side effects, and overall poor quality of life.  These are costly to the healthcare system and to the patient.<br/><br/>While hospitals can bill for and receive higher rates of reimbursement for inpatients with a diagnosis of malnutrition, there is no such pathway for outpatient cancer programs to receive similar increases in payment for these sicker patients.  This, too, must be addressed to help cancer centers afford staff RD positions, allowing outpatients to gain access to appropriate and accessible nutrition care in all comprehensive cancer programs.<br/><br/>Additionally, many cancer outpatients require some form of nutritional support, like tube feedings or parenteral nutrition, at some point during their treatment.  While reimbursement is sometimes available for the formula and supplies, there is no such path for reimbursement for appropriate nutrition assessment and education provided by an RD.  Pressure should also be placed on payors, including Medicare, to review their guidelines for nutrition support coverage criteria in the oncology patient population.  It is not uncommon that cancer patients requiring medically justified nutrition support are denied coverage for their nutrition therapy (formula, supplies, home health nursing, and nutrition care by an RD) based on outdated or short-sighted benefit limitations.  Patients in such cases are therefore left to pay large out of pocket sums, if they can pay at all, for what in turn would be a cost-effective investment by the insurer and benefiting the healthcare system overall.<br/><br/>Finally, in the absence of easy access to reliable, evidence-based nutrition care, patients may feel compelled to seek answers or guidance to their nutrition and diet-related questions or problems from sources on the internet, friends/family, or unqualified or alternative practitioners without the training or knowledge of the unique and often complex needs of the oncology patient.  Patients can easily be misled by well-intentioned individuals, or otherwise, to adopt inadequate or even dangerous dietary practices and/or to use unproven or contraindicated herbal products and dietary supplements.  RDs are positioned and trained to identify patient beliefs around these practices and to provide education and counseling to help patients evaluate claims that could potentially lead them to make unfortunate decisions about not only their diet, but their cancer treatment, as well.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration on this very important topic.<br/><br/>",

    "text": "Companies should not have to complete a process of spending 4 years and $6 million coming up with a document that has dubious environmental quality to it and it&#39;s just a $6 million stack of paper. would you rather them spend $6 million on  a stack of paper or actually do something to protect the environment,  it would pass out of here unanimously to do something to  protect the environment. But that is not the process that was companies were going through in past 8 years. So anytime of question the process, all of a sudden it becomes a question of whether or not we want to protect the environment. It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with six inches of paper and $6 million.<br/>Makers never intended for the CEQ to become a super environmental agency. Nor one person as the head of it and they would have complete and total control over all other agencies. it is a mistake to regard the CEQ as a potential high court for the environment or super agency. If you look at the section of the law which creates and empowers  the CEQ, there are many things that it has not done, that it has  not been permitted to do, in effect, by under-staffing and by underfunding. There has been, to me, unaccountable, that there should be in  the Congress such a resistance to any attempt to forecast. By that,  I don&#39;t mean predict. I mean to look at the trends that are occurring  in the society, their interactions, to the best of our knowledge,  and draw from them at least certain findings with respect to the  direction in which we&#39;re going. to the effect that this was going to be a bad idea because  it would destroy consumer confidence, that we can&#39;t predict,  we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen in the future, and, therefore, it would be a waste of time and money. <br/>Important to be extremely proactive in trying to have local community involvement with NEPA  decisions. Having local community involvement  and locally based people involved with these decisions. The  way the process currently works, that just did not happen in past 8 years.  A huge problem with the current implementation of  NEPA is that the agencies themselves don&#39;t have the wherewithal  to implement this process over here. They don&#39;t have the  technical staff and the management skill sets. They don&#39;t have the  resources, period, in many cases to do this, and that&#39;s why there&#39;s  these huge cost over-runs and it ties back into the process has kind of gotten out of control. not just gridlock. They cannot fulfill their mandate to implement NEPA. the process has become  so cumbersome, I think that if the process was back streamlined  to a reasonable level, that there would be adequate resources  to produce the type of analysis that I think was envisioned in the beginning. But it&#39;s gotten so complex and out of hand that, in fact, agencies themselves, even if they had a budget, would probably not be able to staff adequately to do the level of detail that everyone in the world wants done in EIS&#39;s. The process of involving non-Federal government  entities, soil and water conservation districts, counties, states  and tribal governments, we&#39;re talking about specific jurisdictions. Those entities already have plans and policies in effect. They already have state statutes and county ordinances that  they are carrying out. The object in the NEPA process is disclosure,  disclosure to the Federal agency decisionmaker what those plans and policies are. encourage voluntary participation by the citizens in the community  on those communities that are bringing this input to the table for those Federal agency decisionmakers. more like a NEPA document is a planning document, its a disclosure of the conditions, disclosure of the existing conditions, a reasonable  prediction of future conditions, and will the natural resources that are there fulfill those needs in the future. You can have social engineering, which is what a lot of planning documents end up as, or you can  have a planning document that offers disclosure to decisionmakers,  what the conditions are and what the possible conditions in the future are going to be.<br/><br/>",

This is not what the public and organic consumers want, and it simply is not right. At this point in history, we should be focusing on converting the millions of conventional acres to organic, not going after un-farmed and potentially valuable habitat so that a farmer can suddenly be organic.<br/>I support the proposed definition of Native Ecosystems, and support requiring a timeframe of 10 years of ineligibility for those lands that have been converted. I encourage you, the NOSB, to pass this proposal. I also encourage that a Guidance be written to ensure uniform compliance. <br/><br/>Organic consumers do not always understand the complexity of these issues, but undoubtedly do not believe that native prairies and tropical forests are being destroyed for instant production of certified organic grains, palm oil, sugar and other products. We all rely on the integrity of the NOP to constantly and consistently regulate actions that equate organic farming with strong environmental standards.<br/><br/>",

None of them worked. <br/><br/>I then tried vaping. It took me 3 attempts but always went back to cigs.<br/>I did not like how any of the juices tasted. I could vape it for a while<br/>But then get sick of the taste. Then one day I came across a flavor that<br/>I enjoyed and could vape on it all day everyday. This is what is called an<br/>All day vape flavor. Each person will be different with this choice as taste<br/>Is subjective to each individual. This was 3 years ago.<br/><br/>When I started vaping it took me 24mg of nic to quit. In this time I have gotten<br/>Down to 6 mg in tank, or 3 mg in a dripper. I plan to go down to 3 and 1.5 respectively next month. In this time my fiancee, my son and step daughter have <br/>also been able to quit as well.<br/><br/>You should not remove flavorings as if the person does not like it<br/>they will most likely no be successful in quitting and after all this is the <br/>purpose of vaping. I&#39;m not going to go into if it is better then smoking as we all know it is, this has been proven. Now in regards to kids and then packaging.<br/>I fully agree something needs to be done but banning flavors is not the answer.it<br/>The packaging is. I don&#39;t think you will get much of an argument if made all packaging in black and white only with no graphics or pictures. The juice flavor<br/>and and description is enough along with word of mouth. Please do not take away flavors and instead focus on packaging. You will save many lives and nobody will disagree too much with a decision like that.<br/><br/>Thank you very much if you took the time to read this.<br/><br/>Thank you<br/>Brad R",

I smoked Newport menthol 100&#39;s for almost 5 years and i&#39;d smoke a pack a day if not more sometimes.  I finally came to a point last November where I could tell my health was declining and I would wake up in the morning not being able to breath and have a lot of congestion.  I decided to try vaping and one of the things that always intrigued me with it was the flavors.  <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>My first flavor was a kiwi, apple, and pear blend and i absolutely fell in love with it.  I eventually would buy other flavors such as donut and candy flavors like blue raspberry (i&#39;ve always been a fan of raspberry anything so immediately i was a fan).  From my understanding and my opinion i think that flavors targeting kids in very invalid.  I can walk into a wine and spirits and 70 percent of the liquor is flavored with cotton candy, whipped cream, and birthday cake.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In my opinion liquor can be just as easy to obtain as e-liquid flavors by minors or young adults however in my eyes alcohol is a lot worse and can be a lot more damaging however i&#39;m certainly not saying that vaping is healthy.  I don&#39;t think regulating flavors is fair for adults who do vape and who do enjoy trying new flavors or enjoy vaping candy or &quot;kid&quot; flavors.  To me vaping somewhat saved my life or might have saved my life and has become a very fun hobby for me as i no longer smoke cigarettes. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Thank you for your time and i hope this will be read along with other submissions that others will be submitting!",

I feel much healthier now thanks to the flavored juice, I think that removing flavored ejuice would be a terrible downfall for all children out there because if they currently are using vapes or end up getting into it they could still end up getting unflavored juice and attempting to add household additives to their juice to add flavor which could be dangerous depending on what they use. I&#39;m by no means an expert but I would much rather my kid alive then dead because they needed flavors in their ejuice so they mixed something in on their own and in turn something bad happened.",

    "text": "Hello,<br/><br/>I first started smoking cigarettes due to adolescent ignorance and peer pressure when I was 14 years old. The taste wasn&#39;t as such a factor as getting a   nicotine buzz, in some sense it was my form of young rebellion. Fast forward almost 13 years later and I could never stop smoking no matter what I tried. My health began deteriorating and my stamina was completed drained due to my decreasing lung capacity. <br/><br/>It wasn&#39;t until I discovered vaping that I was able to completely stop consuming tobacco products, and my health has been recovering ever since. Perhaps irreversible damage was done due to smoking at such a young age, but e-cigarettes gave me a second chance to avoid major health problems and possibly even cancer. <br/><br/>Flavor is one of the main factors which keeps me from going back to smoking since the taste is vastly superior to tobacco cigarettes. If you were to restrict them then my logic and behavior would probably regress back into smoking since it&#39;s hard to find a pleasant tobacco flavored e-juice. I understand we need to try our best as a society to help the younger generation make good decisions and prevent them from consuming harmful products, but I must draw a line when we begin infringing the freedoms of others. Especially when the change has potential to cause alot of harm in those who found a second chance with e-cigarettes. <br/><br/>I believe smoking has lost much popularity among-st the younger population due to proper advocacy and education, and we should continue this trend. Restricting products which shouldn&#39;t be in the hands of children to begin with is the job of parents, and harmfully punishing the majority for the mistakes of others who aren&#39;t properly monitoring their kids is very illiberal. The FDA should seriously reconsider banning flavored e-juice because it will inevitably cause more harm than good.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>P.S. I&#39;m open to some regulation such as proper labeling of ingredients and restrictions on known chemicals that are extremely harmful or carcinogenic. We need to approach this rising industry with smart and reasonable legislation, not knee-jerk overreaction.   <br/><br/>Dana Garoutte<br/>    ",

Taylor Hays, M.D.<br/><br/>No. Despite what you might have heard, cigar smoking isn&#39;t safer than cigarette smoking  even if you don&#39;t intentionally inhale the smoke.<br/><br/>Like cigarette smoking, cigar smoking exposes you to:<br/><br/>    Nicotine. Cigars, like cigarettes, contain nicotine, the substance that can lead to tobacco dependence. A single full-size cigar can contain nearly as much nicotine as does a pack of cigarettes. If you inhale cigar smoke, you can get as much nicotine as if you smoked cigarettes. And even if you don&#39;t intentionally inhale, large amounts of nicotine can be absorbed through the lining of your mouth. Smoking cigars instead of cigarettes doesn&#39;t reduce your risk of nicotine dependence.<br/>    Secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke from cigars contains the same toxic chemicals that secondhand cigarette smoke does. This type of smoke can cause or contribute to lung cancer and heart disease. It also increases the risk and severity of childhood asthma, ear infections, and upper and lower respiratory infections in children.<br/><br/>Cigar smoking poses serious health risks, including:<br/><br/>    Cancer. All tobacco smoke contains chemicals that can cause cancer, and cigar smoke is no exception. Regular cigar smoking increases the risk of several types of cancers, including cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus and larynx.<br/>    Lung and heart disease. Regular cigar smoking increases the risk of lung diseases, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It might also increase the risk of heart disease, such as coronary artery disease.<br/>    Oral disease. Cigar smoking has been linked to oral and dental disease, such as gum disease and tooth loss.<br/><br/>Switching from cigarette smoking to cigar smoking can be particularly harmful because you might inhale cigar smoke the way you inhaled cigarette smoke. The more cigars you smoke and the deeper you inhale, the greater the risks.<br/><br/>Although the health effects of occasional cigar smoking aren&#39;t as clear, the only safe level of cigar smoking is none at all. Instead of trying to choose between cigarette smoking and cigar smoking, try to quit tobacco entirely. There is no safe form of tobacco.<br/><br/>With<br/><br/>J. Taylor Hays, M.D.<br/><br/>According to this article Cigars are are not as harmful as cigarette but if you do smoke you will be subject to the same health risk as cigarette smokers. Most cigar smokers are middle age and older gentleman who have given up a lot of other habits and now enjoy a fine drink and premium cigar every now and then. We are recreational smokers.

I quickly realized she would never be a cigar smoker because of the totally different experiences offered by the two tobacco products. <br/>Quality cigars are expensive. To me that seems to make it unlikely young people will be smoking them routinely.

These are luxury items that are enjoyed by adults on the average of 2 cigars per month, as I understand it.  No teenager is going to spend $10 on 1 cigar.  Just like they wouldn&#39;t spend $30-$80 on a bottle of scotch when a case of cheap beer can be obtained for less than a dollar a beer. <br/><br/>Premium cigars and pipe tobacco manufacturers are typically small businesses and family owned from generations back. Their product is savored and enjoyed.  Cigars and pipes compliment different drinks and meals.  They are relaxing and very enjoyable.  Cigarettes are filled with preservatives and all manner of additional chemicals to help keep them lit and from going stale. Pipe tobacco and cigars don&#39;t incorporate these additional chemicals.  Pipes and cigars are an art form in which the one who partakes can enjoy differing flavor profiles, marketing artwork, and employ all of their senses into the enjoyment of consuming them.  <br/><br/>Additionally, cigars and pipe tobacco are not traditionally inhaled (neither I nor any of my friends who enjoy pipes and cigars inhale) which is a stark difference from cigarettes. This, in conjunction with the fact that, on average, cigar and pipe smokers smoke considerably less than cigarette smokers should not cause you to need to further restrict the cigar and pipe tobacco industries.  There are already plenty of restrictions around where one can smoke.  Don&#39;t hurt the small businesses by restricting further.  The USA is a free republic.

    "text": "Hello,<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I am typing today to address the possible decision of the ATF, in some small hope able to dissuade the decision for <br/>making this rule. I have retired from the Reserves after nearly 23 years of service, I am a municipal police officer with almost<br/>twenty one years of service. I am a firearms instructor (19 yrs), department armorer and I attained my Associates degree in the Science<br/>of Firearms Technology and Gunsmithing. I am providing this information to provide to you that I am not only speaking from the<br/>heart, but with the knowledge and experience regarding this rule making decision. Emotionally, I want to cry foul and yell and <br/>scream at how wrong of a decision this is, but I know that will only garner closed doors. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I do not have experience with, or own a &quot;bump fire&quot; stock, so I cannot say as to if the finger is coming off of the trigger completely<br/>or if its resting after it has reset. My question is that after the &quot;bump stock&quot; had been examined in its initial inception, why was <br/>there no determination then as to classifying it as a machine gun? The answer is that you found that according to the rules and<br/>definitions you provided, there was no violation and it was not considered a machine gun. Your statement regarding the creator of the <br/>bump stock, saying that he wasn&#39;t able to afford a machine gun did so that he could have a practical &quot;machine gun&quot;. This still <br/>doesn&#39;t hold water, due in part that it is close to a machine gun but wasn&#39;t. Suddenly, now due to political pressures there is a<br/>reversal to the definition? <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>The next question that I have, regarding your estimate about the government cost to the bump stock. Quoting directly from your<br/>PDF that is provided, you say in the heading:<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Government Costs<br/>Government costs are estimated as deminimis because collection of the bump stock-type devices by ATF would be an<br/>ancillary duty of existing ATF Special Agents.<br/>    <br/>Has there been the consideration or estimation of how many people who will find this ruling unethical and against the freedoms<br/>and rights of the American people and willfully disobey your ruling? By this, and your estimation of how many bump stocks <br/>sold to retailers and the public, you will be lucky to see fifty-percent of the stocks made actually turned in to be destroyed. This<br/>means that anyone in possession will be prosecuted by the federal government, this will be the next cost that you have not <br/>provided in your document. You have either not planned for it (which I do not believe) or you are not revealing these estimates<br/>to the public due to the inject of  fear, panic and anger this will create. <br/><br/>Which brings me to the next question, what would your plan be if there was mass refusal to obey this ruling? This has created some <br/>real fear and there are those who readily believe that this would spell the beginning of the end of the Second Amendment. <br/><br/>My next concern is that, now it is bump stocks, but what if in a year is a Franklin Binary trigger, or a Geissele competition trigger?<br/>You say that you have no interest in that now, but I cannot believe that. You will be told to &quot;do your job&quot; and you&#39;ll make <br/>another ruling, saying that the triggers need to be outlawed, much like how this consideration is for the &quot;bump stock&quot;. <br/><br/>&quot;Alternative 3Opportunity alternatives. Based on public comments, individuals wishing to replicate the effects of bump-stock-<br/>type devices could also use rubber bands, belt loops, or otherwise train their trigger finger to fire more rapidly.&quot; By the mere <br/>acknowledgement of this, those who are more inclined to commit criminal acts with guns are able to use these techniques <br/>against the public or law enforcement. <br/><br/>Again, this boils down to something that if you felt that it was a problem, you should have ruled against it during it&#39;s inception. <br/>With this, you are basically admitting that you created this problem and having someone who knows law and can argue it in a <br/>civil court could try to bring a civil suit against a government entity for failure to act. <br/><br/>If there is going to be forum with the Director, I would like to be considered one of the ones who are going to comment orally<br/>the Director. Please notify me if there are any other ways that I need to submit information for this request. &quot;D. Request for <br/>Hearing. Any interested person who desires an opportunity to comment orally at a public hearing should submit his or her <br/>request, in writing, to the Director of ATF within the 90-day comment period. The Director, however, reserves the right to<br/>determine, in light of all circumstances, whether a public hearing is necessary.&quot;<br/><br/>Thank you in advance. ",

It would be interesting to see an experiment testing this, however. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Topic 3: This sounds more complicated, because human milk has differing amounts of vitamins depending on the nutritional status of the mother whom it came from. I think this is interesting, though.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Topic 4: This would actually be very interesting. Non-nutritive chemical compounds like polyphenols have been shown to have a remarkable effect on nutrient absorption- this data would likely answer many of our questions as well as creating new ones. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Topic 5: This would be incredibly difficult to have any meaningful results, because even within a specific type of diet, there can be considerable variance in the foods one consumes. For example, as a vegan, I consume mostly whole plant foods, with most of it being vegetables, a small amount of fruits, beans, and whole grains. Some vegans choose to eat nothing but fruit and greens, some choose to eat mostly legumes, and some choose to eat mostly junk food. There will have to be LOTS of controls. Yes, I would hope that changes to recommendations would be made according to the new data that is collected.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Topic 6 and 7.  This seems pretty interesting, too, but has the same difficulties associated with topic 5. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Topics 8-11. This should be interesting, since adults typically are not growing and thus do not need as many nutrient as those who are-but it still has the difficulties associated with confounding variables. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Topics 12-17. During pregnancy, I would think that the best way to get extra calories is to eat more fruits and vegetables, beans and whole grains, or to take a supplement-interesting nonetheless-the answer is probably a bit more obvious than to the other questions. Supplements&#39; effects can be counterintuitive, so this would be very interesting. More research on the allergies would be welcomed (in my opinion). Seafood research could be interesting, but I don&#39;t think it is as necessary as the environmental effects of seafood farming and trawling warrant an exclusion of it as a food source anyway. Research on how beverages affect us is always interesting to me. For alcohol, since recent research has confirmed that it causes cancer, I would never recommend it in any amount to anyone, but especially recommend pregnant women to never drink alcohol. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Topics 18-19. If we are to make any strides in extending human lifespan, research on this type of thing is crucial, in my opinion. I would love to see more of this data! <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Overall, I really like these questions. I am looking forward to seeing some of the newer recommendations and modifying my dietary habits accordingly. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>",

There is a issue with defining a bump stock as a machine gun. In 26 U.S.C. 5845(b) the  &quot;to shoot automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.&quot; When a bump stock is used the trigger is actuated every single time the rifle recoils, which there by actuates the trigger &quot;once&quot; during each firing of the rifle.

I propose that the above stated information be carefully reviewed so a gross error or negligent misinterpretation of the law is not put forth. The misidentification of a &quot;machine gun&quot; opens the definitions of other firearms related statutes to be misinterpreted as well and I encourage you to not error so egregiously on subjects of 2nd Amendment protections as stated in the United States Constitution. <br/><br/>  As the premise for this action by the ATF is to mitigate further &quot;mass shootings&quot; I put forth a suggestion that, more research is needed as to bring actual and functional responses to mitigate the increase in &quot;mass shootings&quot; in the United States.",

This is unlikely because cigarettes cost a lot and if you cut the amount of nicotine smokers will go to<br/>other sources for their nicotine.  If I were a betting woman I would say the Culiacan Sinaloa Mexican Drug Cartel right now is seeing DOLLAR SIGNS with your<br/>announcement to lower nicotine in the USA.  They smuggle Meth, Heroin, Cocaine, Marijuana and other drugs in the USA.  Once you cut nicotine in Cigarettes they<br/>will start to smuggle Nicotine in the USA.  What happened when we had prohibition???  The Mafia and Al Capone, and Lucky Luciano became the source for alcohol.<br/>They had huge profits because alcohol was illegal.  Years later Prohibition was repealed.  When you cut the amount of nicotine in cigarettes you will create<br/>something called unintended consequences, otherwise known as, the law of unintended consequences.

They are seeing the Dollar Signs!!<br/><br/>Time will tell......I know exactly what you will do...its not rocket science you will create a black market for nicotine.<br/>Lawyers, Doctors, Executives, Politicians, Average people smoke.

If you dont have it their are REALLY bad side effects and they are nasty.<br/>Smokers will lose their jobs because they wont be able to think straight without their daily nicotine fix.<br/>I am pretty sure smokers will call their Congress People about this issue.<br/>I am also sure they will be voting as well.<br/><br/>Pandora&#39;s Box.<br/>",

    "text": "&quot;such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.&quot; Yet there are still subsequent functions of the trigger to continue that rate of fire.  In reality the initiation of firing the weapon with a bump stock or any bump fire method isn&#39;t even done with a &quot;pull of the trigger&quot;. It is done with the forward pressure of the assisting hand pushing the trigger against the trigger finger and continues the firing of the firearm with that forward pressure. The recoil of the firearm allows for the reset of the trigger. Without the forward pressure the firearm will not continue to fire. There is nothing built into bump stocks that mechanically applies forward pressure, there has to be individual input like pulling a trigger for every firing cycle. This rule change doesn&#39;t even make sense and is a lazy &quot;solution&quot; to a &quot;problem&quot; that falls under the authority of Congress. This rule change will not have any effect on crime, will ultimately further the transfer of power from the Legislature(some in congress are shucking their responsibility) to the Executive(specifically the Bureaucracy), and furthers the stripping of rights from law abiding citizens.<br/><br/>&quot;A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.&quot;<br/><br/>It&#39;s not possible to honestly believe that this one sentence wasn&#39;t intended to apply to accessories, ammunition, or any arm that one could use to defend them self(&quot;right of the people&quot;) or country(&quot;free state&quot;) once the evidence has been weighed. There never was any law or rule regulating the attachment of bayonets to firearms, the prepackaging of shot and ball for faster reloading(higher rate of fire), caliber of firearms, construction of shot(materials or intended uses), or ownership of artillery and explosives in that era(leading up to the NFA of 1934) our Founding Fathers ratified that one sentence and others like it of Liberty.<br/><br/>The notion that none of the weapons or arms of today hadn&#39;t been thought of then is null as it would have to expect that our Founding Fathers were complete imbeciles and couldn&#39;t for see any advancement in technology regardless of human history. Frankly I don&#39;t see how they could have defeated the strongest empire to exist since the Roman Empire and that spanned the earth to the extent that the sun never set on it if they had been that unintelligent.<br/><br/>This rule change is non-logical, outside of the authority of the Department of Justice, and it&#39;s unconstitutional.

However, the NOSB last addressed the issue in a report in Spring 2015. The report offered an approach for addressing this complex issue through examining feedstocks and pathways. We support the approach in that report. In the intervening three years, the NOSB has not made progress, but another source of contamination has risen in importance -use of water contaminated by oil and gas production.

It is a problem whenever someone portrays as organic a product that does not meet the rigorous organic standards required to use the USDA organic label. Fraud hurts all sectors of the organic community -especially organic producers who follow the letter and spirit of the law and the consumers who depend on the market to provide organic food that meets organic standards. Fraud is a problem when crops that are grown with prohibited inputs, when livestock do not get the required access to pasture, and when organic crops are produced in artificial media.<br/>The topic of inspector qualifications and training, listed separately on the NOSB agenda, is an integral part of fraud prevention. Regulations must be clear, so that they can be enforced. USDA&#39;s National Organic Program (NOP) must have a will to enforce, whether the violator is large or small, foreign or domestic. The task facing the NOSB and NOP is to craft a multi-faceted strategy to prevent organic fraud.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.",

The Act was the culmination of a two-year effort to make federally funded research data (which are often used to develop new regulations) accessible to the public. The provision directed OMB to amend OMB Circular A-110 &quot;to require Federal awarding agencies to ensure that all data produced under an award will be made available to the public through the procedures established under the Freedom of Information Act&quot; (FOIA, codified at 5 U.S.C. 552). &quot;Shelby Amendment,&quot; As a result of the changes, in response to a covered FOIA request, agencies are required to obtain certain types of research data from grantees and provide the requester access to the data. The Act which was a two-sentence rider attached to the Treasury and Postal section of the Omnibus on solidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY1999 (Public Law 105-277, enacted on October 21, 1998). OMB&#39;s revisions to the circular took effect in November 1999.

EPA, Interior Dept. Energy dept, Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife and Agricultural, dept of Transportation, etc. are the entity of the United States government that during last administration was seeking sweeping regulations on the basis that GHGs are increasing global temperatures. EPA&#39;s reliance on the IPCC for GHG emissions results is a VIOLATION of the Data Quality Act, (The Information Quality Act (IQA), sometimes referred to as the Data Quality Act, was enacted in December 2000 as Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-554). The act required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance to federal agencies designed to ensure the &quot;quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity&quot; of information disseminated to the public. It also required agencies to issue their own information quality guidelines, and to establish administrative mechanisms that allow affected persons to seek correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agencies that does not comply with the OMB guidance. Although some observers said the IQA would improve the quality of agency science and regulation, others viewed the act as a tool by which regulated parties could slow or even stop new health, safety, and environmental standards. Because of the scant legislative history of the IQA and its lack of detail, OMB&#39;s guidance interpreting key provisions in the act has a major effect on its implementation. In those guidelines, OMB noted that the act applies to virtually all federal agencies and established the broad scope of the guidelines by defining &quot;information&quot; as &quot;any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in any medium or form.&quot; Similarly, the guidelines define &quot;dissemination&quot; as any &quot;agency initiated or sponsored distribution of information to the public.&quot; OMB indicated that &quot;quality&quot; encompasses elements of utility, objectivity, and integrity, and said agencies can generally presume that data are &quot;objective&quot; if they have been subject to an independent peer review process.<br/>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) require agencies to analyze the economic impact of regulations to determine whether there would be a significant economic impact on small entities, the agency must conduct an initial regulatory flexibility analysis with the proposed rule and a final regulatory flexibility analysis with the final rule.

We have lost 2/3 of our production and thousands of jobs because of the disease. To counter the devastation, the industry launched a massive, multi-million dollar research effort designed to uncover short, medium and long term tools growers can use to mitigate the effects of HLB.<br/><br/>Bactericides are one of the useful therapies growers are employing as a result.  FireLine (Oxytetracycline) is one of two types of bactericides currently being used in the field under a Section 18 emergency use exemption. The other is Streptomycin. Both have proven to increase yields and tree health offering growers hope they can bridge the gap between the short term and the long term. <br/><br/>Not only is FireLine an effective tool but research reports the bactericide has no negative implications on other microbes in groves where it is used. Plus, there are no residue issues in the fruit. <br/><br/>I cannot understate the importance of granting a Section 3 registration to FireLine.  The bactericide is an essential and safe tool that will help ensure the future of the Florida citrus industry.<br/><br/>Thank you for allowing me to comment and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Michael W.

    "text": "Section 101 of NEPA neither authorizes nor requires action. The nature of Federal agency obligations under NEPA has been subject of a number of Supreme Court decisions. In a nutshell, these opinions say that Section 102 (42 U.S.C.  4332) contains the procedural requirements of NEPA, the so-called &#39;&#39;action forcing&#39;&#39; provisions, which are the only requirements of NEPA. NEPA contains no substantive law and invoking NEPA does not interfere with the ultimate agency decision if NEPA processes have been correctly conducted. Beginning at least with Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390 (1976), the Supreme Court identified the NEPA &#39;&#39;program&#39;&#39; as its action-forcing procedural duties under Section 102. Id., 427 U.S. at 409, n.18. Section 101 has been consistently described as a set of national goals. &#39;&#39;NEPA does set forth significant substantive goals for the Nation, but its mandate to the agencies is essentially procedural.&#39;&#39; Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 558 (1978); accord, Stryker&#39;s Bay Neighborhood Council v. Karlan, 444 U.S. 223, 227 (1980). As recently as 1989, the Court has distinguished between Section 101&#39;s declaration of &#39;&#39;a broad national commitment&#39;&#39; and Section 102&#39;s &#39;&#39;action-forcing procedures.&#39;&#39; Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989).This being the case, no programmatic authorization can be tortured into NEPA goals. Any such new program must come from Congress. NEPA does not have decision-making authority; rather its function is to provide a framework for disclosure and sound planning. NEPA requires that Federal agencies provide the public with full and adequate disclosure of impacts to local community economy. <br/>We have so many competing interests involved in a Federal agency actionsome with much at stake, others with nothing at stakethat various Environmental Activists groups often tend to impose their will upon an agency to make a particular decision, regardless of what the true scientific facts are. Decisions are routinely made without the State&#39;s consent or comments or worse still, State&#39;s comments and concerns are ignored. This style of management is simply unacceptable and merely leads to friction in what could and should be a more collaborative process.<br/>Development of oil and gas, mining, farming, ranching on Federal lands, agency should look at ways in which to streamline leasing process , resolve resource conflicts. Demonstrate that consensus can be reached when varying interests are included from the outset in a particular issue.<br/>NEPA was a well-intentioned law aimed at providing Federal agencies with the necessary tools to make decisions about how resource development projects might affect our environment and examine ways in which to mitigate those impacts. But also think of it as a law of unintended consequences. Numerous complaints of the unnecessary delays associated with Environmental Assessments and EIS&#39;s, not to mention the costs incurred with the work product.<br/>With a little help and consistency from both State and Federal agencies across the country, we can not only improve contents of NEPA documentation, but we can reduce time frame allotted to them <br/>Application and implementation of NEPA by past Administrations has not been based on science, as Act requires, but on pure politics. Take, for instance, a blow-down in Sabine National Forest in eastern Texas. Roughly 102,000 acres of trees were blown down, broken and lying on the forest floor. This is indeed a catastrophic event and the waivers provided by CEQ were correct and needed. These waivers allow logging companies to go in and harvest the dead trees, clean the forest floor, protect the area from wildfire, and, thus, save the Sabine National Forest&#39;s health. moving quickly in Texas by waiving NEPA to achieve forest health objectives. Contrast this with what is happening in northern Idaho, the Idaho Panhandle National Forest, suffered ice storm damages on thousands of acres, why the past administration can do one way in Texas, but fails to do so in Idaho, Washington, Montana, California, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico and Colorado. Unfortunately, this appears to be a pattern. More than half of the budgets of both the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service go to the west and, in the case of National Marine Fisheries Service, more than 70 percent of its enforcement budget goes to the northwest. Why? <br/>NEPA requires the Federal Government to consider environmental impacts of its actions including small business and people working the land, and, even more importantly, NEPA often provides the only opportunity for public comment on these Federal proposals. <br/>Council of Environmental Quality, which formed under NEPA statute. A discretionary ability for Council on Environmental Quality to pick certain areas to do things and certain areas not to do things for political purposes. If that is the case, then the Act itself is failing. ",
