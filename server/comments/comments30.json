    "text": "Dear Secretary ZInke,<br/><br/>I already submitted written comments on Bear&#39;s Ears and plan to submit a detailed letter on the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument before the comment deadline of July 10.  We have been visiting the Grand Staircase Escalante region since the early 1990s, before it was designated a National Monument.  In the meantime, I wanted to share with you our recent letter to the editor regarding the Grand Staircase and Bear&#39;s Ears that was printed in High Country News and shares my and my husband&#39;s view of the impact of Monument designations on local communities.<br/><br/>I live in a rural area of California (the Eastern Sierra region) and I know very well the impact special land designations can have on the economy and nearby communities.  I live in Lee Vining, CA adjacent to the Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area, which was designated in 1984 amid local controversy.   I moved here in 1984 just before the designation, and have witnessed the transformation of our town in the years since the designation (during that time I served for 16 years on the Mono County Planning Commission).  Today, Lee Vining is a thriving community from late spring through the fall (when mountain passes are open) and an international destination for tourists.  While there will always be disagreements over precisely how a piece of public land is managed, no one disputes the economic benefits the Scenic Area designation brought not only to our community but to our County, Mono County. <br/><br/>I hope you will retain the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument designation in full, and not undo years of investment in protecting these landscapes for the benefit of all the people, including those who live in nearby communities.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my written comments today, and those contained in our letter to the editor. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sally Miller<br/>Lee Vining, CA  93541",

As a former commercial fisherman in Alaska,   I chose to live here because of its proximity to wildlife reserves and wildlife habitats,  the salmon runs and the historic removal of the Elwha dam, which is returning salmon to the Elwha river. Our salmon runs support commercial and sport  fishing industries and provide an important cultural  resource for our First Nations people.  An equally integral contributor to the economic survival of the<br/>Peninsula is tourism.  Without the EPA to serve as a vigilant protector against clean air and clean water violators, illegal logging, and violations of wildlife and wildlife habitat protection we stand to lose the economic and spiritual heartbeat that gives life to our region. Please don&#39;t gut the regulations that have protected these valuable economic and spiritual resources; we need them now more than ever. They are part of our national heritage and identity and it would be a grave error to sacrifice them--and the jobs they support-- in a misguided effort to save money.   Though it was written in 1960, Wallace Stegner&#39;s eloquent, impassioned plea for wilderness is even more relevant and urgent today.  I attach it here for your consideration.  ",

Coal mining operations and coal burning power plants have fouled drinking water with coal ash and the air with mercury.  The EPA should not be an enabler of corporate crime and negligence.

    "text": "The federal government as well as states have meaningful roles to play in protecting the human health and the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as the federal government&#39;s primary enforcer of environmental laws, plays the most important role in regulating industry to the benefit of the greater good. <br/><br/>Environmental regulations specify the procedures for carrying out laws such as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, RCRA, TSCA, CERCLA, EPCRA, FIFRA, etc., creating even playing fields for businesses and giving those which voluntarily carry out best practices an incentive to keep doing so. Subsequently, businesses that cheat the law run the risk of civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Does this in the end make regulations good for business and good for jobs? There is strong evidence that an even playing field for businesses encourages competition and a race to the top, rather than a race to the bottom. Every dollar spent on enforcement, environmental remediation, and compliance assistance directly contributes to the creation of jobs. The billions of dollars saved in health care costs through protecting human health keeps more money in peoples&#39; pockets and contributes to a vibrate and healthy economy. <br/><br/>What then, is the role for states? States serve as valuable partners for the EPA in the implementation of environmental laws and regulations. Some states even push for greater environmental protections, creating a race to the top among states, however, without EPA as a federal backstop, states would be much more likely to race to the bottom. Much of the budgets of state environmental agencies come through EPA grants. States have the advantage of being closer to problems and being able to tailor more localized solutions. However, states are also closer linked to industry within their localities and are often more timid at enforcement. EPA is much more well suited to enforce in cases in which the state is hesitant or unwilling to act on behalf of protecting its citizens. EPA also has the advantage of being able to act across state lines, as often environmental problems do no respect political boundaries. Similarly, businesses whose operations span several states can be more efficiently regulated at the federal level. <br/><br/>In summation, you cannot evaluate the effectiveness of regulations through purely numerical terms, as simply reducing the number of regulations does not necessarily make government more efficient. Instead, the impacts of regulations must be properly weighed in terms of costs and benefits, taking into full account the positive aspects of protecting human health as well as the negative aspect of potential inefficiencies. Thus, regulations which protect human health but contain inefficiencies should only be replaced with regulations that simultaneously protect human health to the same or higher degree as well as increase efficiency.",

To turn back the clock and undo those accomplishments would put such lives in jeopardy again. That is unacceptable. The EPA has led the way in protecting The Commons--those things we all need to live, namely, clean air, clean water, clean land.  Although many corporations have already invested in the infrastructure to protect The Commons, there are those that, given the chance, would gladly take advantage of relaxed regulations, thereby endangering The Commons. Plenty of companies have shown that they can be good stewards of the environment AND make a profit. It is not an either/or game.  Keep the regulations that serve to protect The Commons, and hence, Us, the People.  Do not just repeal them because businesses have paid you off, paid off the President, or paid off other lawmakers. Do what is Right, for all of us now, and for all of our children and grandchildren. <br/><br/>Consider what could happen if you repeal the Clean Air Act.

If more people are exposed to higher levels of pollutants, then the health of many Americans will suffer, which will put added burden on the health care system.  The health care system is already in a fragile state.  Given what the Administration wants to do to health care, combined with causing more health problems by repealing important EPA regulations, this country could end up in a very serious crisis.  <br/><br/>I ask you not to repeal key regulations, such as the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. The Congressional Budget Office should be required to do an analysis of the collateral costs to any type of repeal that is proposed.

Invest in clean energies (wind, solar) and create jobs through those industries instead of sliding backward toward an even deeper reliance on our diminishing fossil fuel resources (coal, petroleum). <br/><br/>Please do not repeal existing regulations -- and please continue to put in place regulation that preserves the health of our natural resources for all Americans.<br/><br/>Thank you!",

The proposal generally would cover two categories of loans. First, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term of 45 days or less or loans with multiple advances if each advance is required to be repaid within 45 days. Second, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term greater than 45 days, provided that they (1) have an all-in annual percentage rate greater than 36 percent; and (2) either are repaid directly from the consumer\u2019s account or income or are secured by the consumer\u2019s vehicle. For both categories of covered loans, the proposal would identify it as an abusive and unfair practice for a lender to make a covered loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal generally would require that, before making a covered loan, a lender must reasonably determine that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal also would impose certain restrictions on making covered loans when a consumer has or recently had certain an outstanding covered loan. The proposal would provide lenders with options to make covered loans without satisfying the ability-to-repay requirements, if those loans meet certain conditions. The proposal also would identify it as an unfair and abusive practice to attempt to withdraw payment from a consumer\u2019s account for a\ncovered loan after two consecutive payment attempts have failed. The proposal would require lenders to provide certain notices to the consumer before attempting to withdraw payment for a\ncovered loan from the consumer\u2019s account. The Bureau is also proposing to adopt official interpretations to the proposed regulation."

The American public expects the EPA to safeguard us and not to fear political ramifications. Typically, the EPA is led by somebody fighting diligently FOR environmental conservation and protections. Never before have I known an EPA Administrator to have current law suits pending against the very agency he leads, which makes me question his ethics and commitment to serve the agency.<br/><br/>Mr. Pruitt, I have lived in rural America all of my life. It is beautiful, peaceful, serene. Fortunately for me, there has never been any industry, or man-made disaster, in my area...just rich farm land. Since I was a child, I have watched the beauty of nature, birds chirping in the big Oak tree out back, crickets chirping in the evening as if they were playing a symphony. Nature undisturbed. Do you know what that is like? Have you ever experienced the beauty and majesty of nature you see, smell, and hear? Green tobacco growing in fields that continues endlessly. Vegetable gardens that were large enough to sustain us and other family members throughout winters, because what you had, you gladly shared. Do you know what a good feeling that brings to you and to your family? All untouched...nature the way God gave it to us. No natural or man-made occurrences to take away the natural beauties still in my mind. But, not everyone enjoyed seeing nature untouched like I grew up with. Many Americans live with corporate dumping, toxic chemicals, hazardous waste, and so much more. The thought of not having the EPA to mandate clean ups, revitalizations, and impose fines against those deserving of them for punitive purposes, is a scary thought.<br/><br/>America&#39;s EPA is based on science; and, science is real. Global warming is real. A true American EPA leader would never deny this fact! In fact, they would support it and fight for it!! And, then there is the issue of the Clean Power Plan. This golden opportunity is a chance to reduce carbon pollution from the single largest source of U.S. global warming emissions. Mr. Pruitt, why are YOU trying to help destroy the EPA, our environment, our country...this is AMERICA? Many people and animals will die. Ecosystems will be destroyed. Not just in the United States, but around the world. The environmental damage is causing droughts and famines NOW! We see the environmental damage caused NOW!! People are struggling and dying TODAY!!! <br/><br/>WHAT WILL YOU DO? SUPPORT SAFEGUARDS!! Take a stand for us all and save the environment and the EPA by being a good steward of what you have been entrusted with...it is not just a job, but our future! DO NOT DESTROY IT! The EPA has a founding mission and that is to protect human health and the environment. WHAT WILL YOU DO?<br/><br/>",

The waters of the Cuyahoga River and the airshed above Pittsburgh are just two of the more commonly cited examples. <br/><br/>The EPA&#39;s role is not to create jobs, although jobs are created when the environment is protected.  Businesses looking to start up, expand, or relocate do not choose communities that cannot offer basic amenities like clean water and air to their employees.  Recreation and tourism-based industries especially rely on a healthy environment.   Ironically, by mandating remediation of contaminated sites, such as abandoned mines, EPA could create many jobs in the clean up sector.   I don&#39;t have access to these figures, but I am sure many of them are available. <br/><br/>2017 should have been a year in which proposed regulatory changes took the form of improving regulations to protect the environment.   Instead, we have an administration and congressional majority bent on deregulating industry, gutting environmental regulations and laws, and introducing legislation harmful to communities and the environment.   <br/><br/>I strongly oppose any attempt to overturn environmental regulations, and want to see an independent EPA restored that is unhindered by politicians with industry ties. <br/>",

How cost and benefits are established in addressing point (iii)? Why regulatory reforms and policies are being generated in contradiction to current regulations and why the regulations are estimated to be in the wrong side of the equation?  I agree that periodically, regulations should be reviewed if ineffective or unnecessary, reformulated accordingly and if unnecessary removed.  However, the rational of the EO is not clear and open the door for a swift removal of important environmental and health protection regulations that in the long run will make the cost benefit ratio to plunge.  This was absolutely unnecessary, EPA scientist and policy makers should be acting on point (ii) 24 x 7.  The Executive branch should let science to scientist and  focus on improve the welfare of our nation today and for the future generations.  The DC pot needs to be stirred, but this is not the way. ",

Moreover, clean air and clean water are essential abiotic components of healthy ecosystems that support plant and animal life as well as human life.  As a biologist, parent and grandparent, I find it unacceptable for our country to reduce current regulations that are in place to protect the safety and quality of the water we drink and the air we breathe. If anything, some of those regulations should be should actually be strengthened. Most recently, lead-tainted water in Flint, Michigan and parts of the state of California have underscored the dangers of unsafe drinking water. My own state of Missouri has grappled with undesirable ambient air quality due to unacceptable levels of lead particulates and other pollutants.  Poor quality of both air and drinking water affects our most vulnerable populations: young children and elderly people. The effects are particularly devastating for young children:  For example, exposure to airborne lead compromises the developing nervous system and brain, leading to loss of IQ, learning disabilities and poor academic achievement that can persist into early adulthood and affect lifetime education and achievement.<br/><br/>It is unacceptable to reduce regulations that have been put in place to ensure the safety and quality of the air we breathe and the water we drink. A country that aspires to be &quot;great&quot; (President Donald Trump&#39;s preferred word) cannot and will not be &quot;great&quot; by placing more emphasis on growth and profiit at the expense of human health; the latter is imperative in order to accomplish the former! Human capital is our country&#39;s most important resource, and that human capital must be protected. Do not harm it by compromising the safety of our air and drinking water! PUBLIC HEALTH MUST COME FIRST!! <br/><br/>Respectfully submitted,<br/>Ilene Follman <br/>St. Louis, Missouri <br/><br/>",

I have not had another cigarette since then.<br/>I had tried at least 10 times to quit smoking over the years, by different methods,<br/>using the weaning method, and nicotine gum. But had been unsuccessful  in stopping the deadly-nasty habit of smoking cigarettes. Then I found e-vapor and was finally successful in smoking cessation. Hurray, I was off those horrible stinky chemical laden<br/>cigarettes finally!  I feel so much better, my lungs are clear and I don&#39;t have that<br/>horrid smokers cough anymore.  And I don&#39;t smell like a nasty ashtray anymore.<br/>Thank God for vaping!  I have been smoke free for 5 years now. I use multiple eliquid flavors in my personal vaporizers.<br/>I switch back and forth between these flavors and have done so over the past 5 years. I don&#39;t vape straight tobacco flavor or menthol flavor. I have no interest in vaping<br/>a cig-alike ecigarette which contains plain tobacco flavor. <br/> I prefer a vanilla- custard crme flavored ejuice primarily but I also like fruit and candy flavor ejuices.  I use an advanced personal vaporizer to vape with, using a rebuildable, refillable atomizer tank on a box mod.<br/>I am horrified that the FDA is seeking to take away my access to buying vaping<br/>products such as box mods,  rebuildable tanks, and flavored ejuices, because this<br/>is what I use to vape with on a daily basis.<br/>What will happen if this is suddenly taken away? I will face having to smoke nasty<br/>and deadly cigarettes once again. Not just me, but the millions of other vapers who<br/>have successfully stopped smoking via vaping. Plus the other people who smoke, who<br/>have not yet had the chance to use vaping to help them get off the stink nasty cigarettes. <br/>I have already lost the ability to purchase vaping supplies from my favorite vaping stores , who have shut down in the face of these strangling regulations from the FDA.<br/>I have seen many good people ( small business owners) who own Vape businesses<br/>have to cease their operations, thus losing their source of income.<br/>It has made it difficult on me to try and purchase supplies to vape with.",

    "text": "Growing up in Utah I was fortunate enough to spend much of my childhood exploring the incredible red rock country of southern Utah. Many of our trips were to Escalante-Grand Staircase National Monument, located a short distance from a close friend&#39;s house in Teasdale. From when we first started visiting the area in 1992 to my visit last summer, the spectacular areas we love to hike (Calf Creek Falls, Boulder Mountain, the Burr Trail, and on and on...) have thankfully not changed much. However, the once tiny towns of Torrey, Boulder, and Escalante (not to mention Moab...) have grown substantially, with most of the commercial growth appearing to cater to the growing number of visitors to this spectacular region. Similarly, on a trip to Grand Gulch (in now- Bears Ears) last summer to explore Ancestral Puebloan ruins, I patronized restaurants, a grocery store, and gas stations in Blanding and Bluff, as I know many of my fellow adventurers do/will too. <br/><br/>As federal lands, all citizens have a stake in the management of these lands. Removing protections at the behest of a vocal and self-interested minority is clearly not in the best interest of most residents of this region, the state of Utah, and the Country. I demand that you not  undermine the integrity of the visionary and extremely important Antiquities Act. President Roosevelt is rightly honored among our greatest presidents for his foresight, including his passage of the Antiquities Act - TR would no doubt be horrified by the complete capture of the Republican party by extraction industries and misguided (and hypocritical) sagebrush rebellion types. The Act was specifically intended to protect areas from short-term destruction and revoking the monuments would invite degradation of the region and set a horrible precedent regarding the long-term protection afforded all our National Monuments and National Parks. <br/><br/>With over 100 years of success, THE ANTIQUITIES ACT IS NOT BROKEN - SO DON&#39;T CHANGE IT! An extensive public process occurred prior to the monument designations. Particularly with Bears Ears, the boundaries established in the National Monument very closely reflect the compromise that the Republican Utah delegation and Tribes/environmental/public access groups developed over many years of negotiations. To claim this was rammed through without with local input is disingenuous at best.<br/><br/>Please remember that there are more important legacies than the short-term economic bubble that would result from any proposed mining or drilling in the area. As a hiker, backpacker, climber, river rafter, all-around-outdoor-enthusiast, I have spent many thousands of dollars on outdoor recreation and in communities near the places I explore. At 31, I will hopefully have 50+ more years of adventure and investment in these areas with my children, who I know will love them as much as I do. It is my hope that they will be able to share these landscapes with their children in much the same condition that they are today.",
