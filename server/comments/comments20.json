    "text": "My Name is Justin Hopkins I am part of the ownership group for a full line Freightliner/Western Star Dealership group with 10 locations in the following states, Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I feel strongly we have a unique ability to give you the truth when it comes to gliders and the usefulness or cost effectiveness of them without being biased since I can sell an end user both a new Freightliner or a Glider Freightliner as well as assemble them as we have this current calendar year and potentially will continue to assemble them for end users next year and beyond.  <br/><br/>With all this in mind I want to go through a couple points that people are making in terms of why we should roll back the regulations currently in place.  First and foremost, the argument presented that discusses gliders as a cost-effective way for the owner operator to compete with the big fleet.  This is just not true.  Since we here at Truck Centers, Inc are an assembler as well of gliders I can say that a new Freightliner glider assembled by us costs the same as a new Freightliner sold from us assembled from the factory with the following exceptions related do to new safety requirements.  This total dollar amount is not substantial enough though.  Estimates would put that at about $2-4,000 at most.  Since the average cost of a over the road Class 8 sleeper truck today is more than $135,000 that difference is only roughly 2%.   Secondly, in addition to the pricing discussion some folks might make the argument that the 12% Federal Excise Tax is a significant savings. Problem with this line of reasoning is that the IRS has released its updated guidelines stating all Gliders are to have the 12% tax paid so that is not a possible way to make the fully assembled truck less.  <br/><br/>The regulations as they stand today are simply in place to close the loop hole created in the original EPA guidelines.  This loop hole regarding gliders has created a cottage industry for companies such as ours as well as other better-known companies like Fitzgerald Gliders.  While I stand as a partial owner to win financially from rolling the regulations back I find it exceptionally difficult to reconcile with when I know clearly what the right thing to do.  <br/><br/>Allowing sales of 1998-2004 EPA level emission engines into trucks fully assembled or partially assembled defeats the purpose of what we are all here to do.  The difficult yet needed work to remove that black smoke that trucks had become so synonymous with is already completed.  Why would we as a governing body decide to allow ourselves to create a secondary market for dirty engines on less efficient trucks after we went through everything already? We are producing new trucks that are emitting in many cases cleaner air than they are taking in the intake.  The 98-2004 EPA emissions motors to be installed in partially assembled gliders from the factory put out something like 10 times the pollutants.  I ask you all reading this statement why would you want that if we don&#39;t need to?<br/><br/>I strongly encourage the people tasked with amending the regulations to reconsider allowing gliders to be sold with anything less than the current emission level engines.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and the opportunity to express my voice.  If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to reach out to me for further discussions. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>Justin Hopkins",

    "docAbstract": "EPA and NHTSA, on behalf of the Department of Transportation, are each proposing rules to establish a comprehensive Heavy-Duty National Program (Phase II) that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption for onroad heavy-duty vehicles, responding to the President\u2019s directive on March 31, 2014, to take coordinated steps to produce a new generation of clean vehicles. NHTSA\u2019s proposed fuel consumption standards and EPA\u2019s proposed carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions standards are tailored to each of three regulatory categories of heavy-duty vehicles: Combination Tractors; Heavyduty Pickup Trucks and Vans; and Vocational Vehicles. The rules include separate standards for the engines that power combination tractors and vocational vehicles. Certain rules are exclusive to the EPA program. These include EPA\u2019s proposed hydrofluorocarbon standards to control leakage from air conditioning systems in combination tractors, and pickup trucks and vans.\r\nThese also include EPA\u2019s proposed nitrousoxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions standards that apply to all heavy-duty engines, pickup trucks and vans."

    "text": "I am writing as a concerned consumer to urge you to reject the National Chicken Council&#39;s petition to increase poultry line speeds. Investigations, whistleblower accounts, and the USDA&#39;s own inspection records have shown that even at current speeds of 140 birds per minute--more than 2 birds killed every second--problems are rampant. A 2015 Compassion Over Killing investigation inside Mountaire Farms, for example, found that birds who had fallen on the ground were thrown across the room instead of being carried back to the conveyor belt; live birds were tossed into piles with the dead as workers only had time to perform split-second checks of their condition; and birds were shackled by only one leg or had their heads caught in the shackles. Thousands of USDA inspection records also document shackling errors leading to regulatory action, with birds sometimes even entering the scalding tank while still alive. These problems persist because workers are forced to rush to keep up with the current fast pace--and increasing line speeds will only exacerbate them. Chickens and turkeys already lack the bare-bones protections afforded to cows and pigs through the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. If line speeds are increased--which I vehemently oppose--I hope that you will at least spare these birds additional suffering by extending these basic protections to them.<br/><br/>",

Ecological and economic importance of insectivorous bats in Agriculture.  the increased development of wind-power facilities are threatening populations of insectivorous bats Endangered and threatened wildlife may be adversely impacted through project actions such as clearing, grading and road building that occur within the habitats that they occupy. Certain species are unable to avoid direct impact due to their inherent poor mobility (e.g., Blanding&#39;s turtle, club shell mussel, and the brook floater and green floater). Bats are voracious predators of nocturnal insects, including many crop and forest pests. Analyses suggesting that loss of bats in North America could lead to agricultural losses estimated at more than $3.7 billion/year. Bats play an incredibly important role in the ecosystem, eating billions of crop-destroying insects like moths and beetles, as well as mosquitoes. But in just four years, more than a million bats have been killed.  The Indiana bat is a temperate, insectivorous, migratory bat. In spring, reproductive females migrate and form maternity colonies where they bear and raise their young in wooded areas. Accordingly, significant adverse impacts to ecosystems and wildlife would result. depending upon the level of development, some agricultural land could be lost. adverse impacts to organic agriculture.

    "text": "Many  Nations  would like  to  add  more  natural  gas  into  their  electricity  mix  given  its  affordability and low emissions,  and Hydraulic fracturing with U.S. LNG exporting Is widely seen  as  an  excellent  source  of  new  supply. In  A  geopolitical  context, the  benefits  of  diversity  apply  to  suppliers as well as  Gas supplies,  and  the  added  option of  New US drilling Technology  enhances  both kinds of diversity.  This  Is  especially  important  to  Central And  Eastern European  Nations  heavily  reliant  on  Russia  For  natural  gas. This Dependence  has  not  only  led  to  higher prices, but also to  the  ability  of  Russia to exert political pressure on these nations. October  10, 2013, The  Subcommittee On  Energy  And  Power  Hosted  a forum:   Rene Jean-Jumeau, Haiti&#39;s Minister Delegate to the Prime Minister, sees U.S. LNG exports as a means for his country to transition &quot;from an aid based relationship to a trade based relationship.&quot; He said, &quot;The question  of  energy  is central to every type  of  issue  of  development  that  we  can consider.&quot; Jean-Jumeau added that replacing the oil Haiti currently uses  to   generate electricity  with natural  gas  would  lead  to  &quot;a  reduction  in  the  cost  of  electricity  by  at  least  30  percent.&quot;  This  would  have  the  double  benefit  of  making  electricity  more  accessible  to  the  citizens  of  Haiti  (a  majority  of  Haitians  do  not  yet  have  access  to  it),  while  also  ensuring  the  low  energy  prices  necessary  to  attract  investment  in  manufacturing. U.S. .  LNG Exports would serve to strengthen This kind of  cooperation. Ashok Kumar Mirpuri Singapore&#39;s Ambassador To  the  United States, said,  &quot;Increased  LNG Exports to Asia Would  further anchor the U.S. Economic presence and Further contribute  to  enhancing  the  region&#39;s energy security. In Doing  so,  the  U.S. Would strengthen Its partnerships  in the  region, serving regional  stability and Its global interests.&quot; Similarly,  Anita Orban, Hungary&#39;s Ambassador-at-Large for Energy Security Of the  Ministry Of Foreign Affairs, said That &quot;the United States Can advance its own foreign  policy Objectives with a  new tool which is called energy diplomacy.&quot; In effect, rising American Natural gas exports would lead  to  rising American Global  influence,  a development that these nations welcome. many Asian Nations are highly dependent on  imports  for  their  energy needs,  much Of which comes  from the unstable  Middle  East. For This  reason, the Prospect of  U.S. LNG  Is Especially valued for its stability. For example, Yasushi  Akahoshi, Japan&#39;s  Minister Of Economy, Trade,  Industry  And Energy,  Said that &quot;half Of  the expanded demand  for natural gas is coming from the Middle East,  And  our dependence  on that region is  rising.&quot; He  concluded that &quot;the Import  from  the U.S.  Would  be  the  most reliable supply, which  could bring  about  less  dependency  on the  Middle  East.&quot; Taranjit Singh Sandhu, India&#39;s Deputy  Chief  Of  Mission,  Stated that U.S. LNG Exports &quot;would Provide a steady, reliable supply Of clean  energy and  help  diversify  our imports from Our traditional suppliers.&quot;  It  Should  also  be  noted  that many  of the Nations participating  in  the  forum  have  cooperated with  the  U.S. to  impose Economic sanctions  on  Iran.  Quite  arguably,  American  self-sufficiency  in Natural gas  has  made it  easier  for  these  nations to Do so since they  now are less dependent on Iranian natural gas. Jaroslav Zajicek, Deputy Chief  Of  Mission  For  the  Czech  Republic,  Relayed  similar experiences. He Explained that  the  sharp  drop in U.S. Imports  of natural gas Is already  helping  by freeing  up additional  supplies  from  the Caribbean And other sources that  were  once  destined for The U.S.  But now  serve the  Western  European market. &quot;We  Have already seen  examples where the  Russian negotiating position during  contract-renewal talks  was weakened  thanks  to decreasing prices  on the  markets in Western  Europe,&quot; He said. With regard To the threat of Russian  Supply  disruptions  to the  Czech  Republic, Zajicek Urged  that  &quot;if Supplies  get cut, if  our  security  is  in  threat, we  have  to stand  for  each  other.  U.S.  LNG and  US Hydraulic fracturing Would  benefit  the common security  of  the  whole  transatlantic  family.&quot; Russia  Has  a  history  of  threatening to  cut  off Supply  to  Lithuania  And  other nations and  has  occasionally followed through on those threats. &quot;An  Ability to obtain natural gas from the U.S., even if very small amounts by U.S. standards,  would make a huge  impact  on the Lithuanian Gas  market  and  allow the  nation to develop a reliable alternative  to  Russian gas.",

    "text": "Recession of  all oil and gas regulation helps Americans committed to achieving oil and gas energy independence from the OPEC cartel and any nations hostile to our interests.  For too long, we&#39;ve been held back by burdensome oil and gas regulations,  Sound oil and gas energy policy begins with the recognition that we have vast untapped domestic energy reserves right here in America.  Domestic oil and gas from  BLM lands energy policies will lower costs for hardworking Americans and maximize the use of American resources, freeing us from dependence on foreign oil. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages. We must take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own. We can use  the revenues from oil and gas energy production to rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure and  American agriculture. <br/>American income to help Poor, Seniors, And Middle class workers,   Congressional Budget Office  2012 Report Opening Most Federal Lands to Oil and Gas Leasing  Potential Budgetary Effects.    Not all controlled lands are open to leasing now. CBO estimates that, under current laws 2012 and policies, the government&#39;s gross proceeds from all federal oil and gas leases on public lands will total about......... $150 billion over the next decade.....( Before oil and gas regulations currently) ........CBO estimated that about 70 percent of undiscovered oil and gas resources are on federal lands that are available for leasing. How Much Would the Government Collect from Opening ANWR to Development?  CBO expects that opening ANWR to development would yield about $5 billion in additional receipts over the next 10 years, primarily in the form of bonus payments made by private firms for the opportunity to explore for and develop resources in particular areas. Because extraction is currently prohibited, the receipts from leasing in ANWR could not be realized under current law. Between 50 percent and 90 percent of those receipts would be paid to the state of Alaska, if specifications in the authorizing legislation were similar to those in recent legislation. gross royalties from leasing in ANWR would probably total between $25 billion and $50 billion (in 2010 dollars) during the 2023-2035 period, or roughly $2 billion to $4 billion a year. <br/>Congressional Budget Office   2012 Report Opening Most Federal Lands to Oil and Gas    How Much Would the Government Collect from Opening Other Federal Lands? CBO anticipates that new legislation directing the Department of the Interior to immediately offer most other federal lands for oil and gas leasing without any restrictions would accelerate the collection of around $2 billion of future leasing receipts into the next decade. Most of that revenue would come from OCS leases; a portion of those proceeds would be shared with state governments. <br/>Congressional Budget Office 2016  report  Domestic oil and gas production occurring on federal lands or in federal waters off the coast of the United States represented about one-fifth of total U.S. production in 2014. The firms that receive those rights to produce oil and gas make payments to the federal government, which distributes some of the money to states; over the 2005-2014 period, those payments averaged $11 billion per year.<br/>Congressional Budget Office    in 2014  before the rule,<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>report  How Will Shale Development Affect the Federal Budget?  The increase in GDP resulting from shale development has increased federal tax revenues, and it will continue to do so. That increase will be slightly larger than the GDP increase in percentage terms, CBO expects. Specifically,  CBO estimates that federal tax revenues will be about three-quarters of 1 percent (or about $35 billion) higher in 2020. Shale production also contributes to federal receipts through payments that the developers of federally owned resources make to the government. CBO estimates that federal royalties from shale (minus the amounts that the federal government transfers to the states) will be about $300 million annually by 2020. CBO estimates that if shale gas did not exist, the price of natural gas would be about 70 percent higher  .<br/>",

Streams with and without permanent flow, wetlands, and estuaries are the sources of much fresh drinking water, sediment trapping that clean and filter runoff before it enters larger bodies of water, and biodiversity. These features prevent flooding after snow-melt and storm surges during hurricanes. As a resident of California, many of our streams are dry much of the year but carry water after storms. Any pollution or sediment placed in these dry wash beds has huge environmental implications for water quality and biodiversity, and they should be regulated as they are today under current rules, which was the original intention of the Clean Water Act. Our national waters are important for more than just navigation. Please continue to protect them all.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Loretta Moreno, M.Sc.<br/>",

    "text": "DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION<br/>[Docket No. DOT-OST-2017-0069]<br/>390.5   Definitions. Commercial motor vehicle <br/>383.5   Definitions. Commercial motor vehicle<br/><br/>Proposal<br/><br/>Change the definition of commercial motor vehicle (1) in 390.5 and 383.5 to be the same and read as follows:<br/>Commercial motor vehicle (CMV) means a motor vehicle or combination of motor vehicles used in commerce to transport passengers or property if the motor vehicle is a<br/>(1) Combination Vehicle (Group A)having a gross combination weight of 11,794 kilograms or more (26,001 pounds or more), inclusive of a towed unit(s). <br/><br/>Reasoning<br/><br/>1. Simplification<br/>Having a consistent definition of a CMV is less confusing. Using the actual weight vs. weight rating is on point when it comes to safety. An empty trailer may have a GVWR that is as much as 4 times greater than the actual empty weight. Most trailers that are pulled as a commercial commodity are delivered brand new and empty.<br/><br/>2. Financial burden<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>A. Regulations are extensive and complicated.<br/>In printed form, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations Management Edition is 591 pages. <br/>JJ Keller does a pretty good job of explaining the regulations. You can purchase an FMCSA Compliance Manual from JJ Keller for $269 reduced from $697. Their manual with explanations is over 850 pages. In order to stay on top of the constantly changing regulations, it is advised to subscribe to the online version for $425/year. In addition to having knowledge of the extensive federal regulations, drivers and motor carriers are also held responsible for knowing the state regulations of each state they travel through.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>B. Compliance requires hiring personnel to manage.<br/>Staying on top of this large number of regulations and managing DOT compliance of drivers requires at least one full time staff member. As a small motor carrier with 18 drivers, the FMCSA DOT safety officer that performed our last audit said that managing DOT compliance was too much for one person to do. He also said that an annual salary of $35,000 was not enough pay. Based on the recommendation of the FMCSA, for 18 drivers we should have a DOT compliance manager ($40,000) with an assistant ($15,080). Add $8,262 for taxes and insurance, $10,000 for office space, equipment, etc. and your total comes to $73,342.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>C. Compliance requires training.<br/>Ongoing training is required of office personnel and drivers. The USDOT Transportation Safety Institute offers a Motor Carrier Safety Compliance Course for $825. In their own words they describe how complicated the regulations are, &quot;Our state-of-the-art courses are designed to address the complexities, intricacies and challenges facing each of the transportation modes.&quot; Initial and periodic driver training is another expense.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>D. Non-compliance is even more of a financial burden.<br/>Most small motor carriers or independent owner/operators do not have the financial resources to hire a compliance manager nor the time to take on the task themselves. This in turn leads to violations at roadside inspections which lead to fines, increased insurance premiums and vulnerability to lawsuits, enough to put them out of business.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>3. Minimal effect on safety<br/>According to FARS, between the years of 2009 and 2015 large trucks with GVWR between 10,001 and 26,000 were involved in only 1 to 1.5% of all crashes with fatalities. A smaller section of this segment, medium/heavy pickups, was involved in less than half of 1% of all crashes with fatalities.<br/>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, DOT final rule on Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Air Brake Systems states &quot;The FMCSA data indicate that for all types of crashes involving large trucks, those involving trucks with a GVWR over 26,000 pounds have the highest rate of crash involvement.&quot;<br/>Also, the majority of crashes with fatalities that involve large trucks are not the fault of the truck driver. It seems that better training before issuing class D driver licenses would be a better use of resources and have a greater impact on saving lives.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The financial burden imposed on this segment of commercial motor vehicles that falls on the low end of the definition of a large truck exceeds the benefits. This financial burden is wiping out small businesses in the United States. 90% of the trucking industry that delivers goods across the United States is made up of independent owner operators or small motor carriers with fleets of 10 or less. At least consider some relief to those with a minimal safety risk by raising the weight for the definition of commercial motor vehicle.<br/>",

    "text": "Thank you, Maia, for bringing some our suffering to light,  for making visible the &quot;invisible epidemic&quot; of suicides due to chronic pain no longer being treated. Jay Lawrence broke his back in a 1980s accident that ultimately triggered years of chronic pain, ...<br/>his widow, Meredith Lawrence lost her husband to suicide earlier this year after his doctor abruptly decided to cut down his opioid pain medication.  In March, Jay Lawrence shot himself with a gun that he insisted she purchase for him. He was 58. They were together in a park in Tennessee, near where, just two years earlier, they had renewed their wedding vows. When he died, Meredith was holding his hand. Afterwards, she called the police and was arrested for assisting a suicide (she&#39;s now on probation). Jay had warned his wife that there might come a day when the pain became too much for him.<br/>He&#39;d had three back <br/><br/>And Jay is also far from the only person to have taken their life in response: several dozen similar cases have been documented by a growing and furious group of pain patient advocates and doctors (who are not funded by pharmaceutical companies), and who are starting to organize in the aftermath of the crackdown.<br/><br/>The stories are nearly unbearable to read: descriptions of various forms of intense agony, mitigated to some extent with medication, which is then stopped regardless of the patients&#39; pleas.<br/><br/>And then, death: often by shooting, sometimes by overdose.<br/><br/>Kertesz says he receives numerous emails and social media posts from patients who are suffering and thinks the government needs to fund research to specifically track the outcomes of these patients. &quot;Widespread suicidal ideation should be seen as a signal of a major risk,&quot; he says.<br/><br/>Although the guidelines were intended to be voluntary and to apply only to general practitionersnot pain specialiststhey&#39;ve been widely interpreted as a mandate.<br/><br/>Doctors who have patients on doses that exceed the guidelines receive letters from insurers and medical boards suggesting that they cut back; state Medicaid policies have been implemented that actually do mandate a maximum legal opioid dose and pharmacies like CVS are imposing their own limits on what they will dispense.<br/><br/>All of this is occurring despite wide individual variation in opioid metabolism (meaning a high dose for one patient will be a low dose for another), tolerance (over time, higher doses can become necessary), pain condition (again, immensely variable) and a complete lack of research showing that forcibly lowering opioid dose is safe or effective.<br/><br/>&quot;It remains the case that there is no evidence that mandated prescribing reduction results in better outcomes for patients,&quot; say Kertesz.<br/><br/>&quot;A gradual taper is something every patient on high-dose opioids for chronic pain should be encouraged to do, and doctors owe it to these patients to explain why a taper makes sense,&quot; says David Juurlink, professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, who is a major proponent of decreasing the use of opioids for chronic pain.<br/><br/>However, he says, &quot;As much as high-dose opioid therapy is a bad idea, tapering abruptly without the patient&#39;s buy-in makes things worse. I discourage the practice at every opportunity.&quot;<br/><br/>Juurlink says he would never cut opioid dosage as abruptly as was done in Jay&#39;s case. &quot;I would not take someone from 120 to 90 in two weeks, unless he a) really wanted to, and, critically, b) understood that it might be tough, and that I&#39;d take him back up to 120 if things got bad and we&#39;d go more slowly next time.&quot;<br/><br/>In the climate of fear induced by the opioid crisis, however, doctors are focused on self-preservation.<br/><br/>Patients report coming into doctor&#39;s offices and seeing signs advising them that medication doses are being dropped, for everyone, no exceptions. &quot;The popular discourse presents opioids as lethal and physicians as no better than heroin dealers,&quot; says Kertesz<br/><br/>These patients need exactly that: some kind of certificate or validation that their doctors are permitted to prescribe for them and they are patients in good standing.<br/>The CDC also needs to make a public statement saying that its guidelines cannot be used to prosecute doctors who prescribe higher doses in good faith. The goal of lowering dosage is supposed to be to protect patients from the overdose death risk associated with high doses. But lowering numbers on a chart isn&#39;t saving LIVES<br/>The CDC, the DEA, and other regulators who oversee our response to the opioid crisis must take heed. Cutting off opioids used by addicted people hasn&#39;t protected themit&#39;s merely shifted them to more dangerous street supplies like heroin and fentanyl, further increasing the death rate.<br/>For pain patients, these suicides and the stories of those whose pain has worsened as their opioids were take away suggest that they, too, are being harmed. Who is being helped here? The operation cannot be a success if the patients die.<br/><br/>",

Biologist Dr. Mitchell Taylor from the Arctic government of Nunavut, a territory of Canada, refuted these claims in May when he noted that &quot;Of the 13 populations of polar bears in Canada, 11 are stable or increasing in number. They are not going extinct, or even appear to be affected at present.&quot; Sadly, it appears that reporting anecdotes and hearsay as fact, has now replaced the basic tenets of journalism.  Each such alarmist article is larded with words such as &#39;if&#39;, &#39;might&#39;, &#39;could&#39;, &#39;probably&#39;, &#39;perhaps&#39;, &#39;expected&#39;, &#39;projected&#39; or &#39;modeled&#39; - and many involve such deep dreaming, or ignorance of scientific facts and principles, that they are akin to nonsense,&quot; a professor concluded in an op-ed. A Magazine which first warned of a coming ice age in 1920&#39;s before switching to warning about global warming in the 1930&#39;s before switching yet again to promoting the 1970&#39;s coming ice age scare. The April 3, 2006 global warming special report of Magazine was a prime example of the media&#39;s shortcomings, as the magazine cited partisan left-wing environmental groups with a vested financial interest in hyping alarmism. Example ENGINEERED &#39;&#39;CONSENSUS&quot; a newspaper featured an op-ed by a social scientist at University and the author of a 2004 Science study. Insisted that a review of 928 scientific papers showed there was 100% consensus that global warming was not caused by natural climate variations. However, the analysis in Magazine excluded nearly 11,000 studies or more than 90 percent of the papers dealing with global warming, according to a critique by social scientist. Example media endlessly hypes studies that purportedly show that global warming could increase mosquito populations, malaria, West Nile Virus, heat waves and hurricanes, threaten the oceans, damage coral reefs, boost poison ivy growth, damage vineyards, and global food crops, Oddly, according to the  another  reports, warmer temperatures almost never seem to have any positive effects on plant or animal life or food production. Poll found that most Americans do not attribute the cause of recent severe weather events to global warming, and the portion of Americans who believe global warming is naturally occurring is on the rise. it appears that alarmism has led to skepticism. The American people know when their intelligence is being insulted. They know when they are being used and when they are being duped by the hysterical left. The American people deserve better -- much better -- from our fourth estate. We have a right to expect accuracy and objectivity on climate change coverage. We have a right to expect balance in sourcing and fair analysis from our leaders  who cover the issue. must roll back this mantra that there is scientific &quot;consensus&quot; of impending climatic doom as an excuse to ignore recent science. After all, there was a so-called scientific &quot;consensus&quot; that there were nine planets in our solar system until Pluto was recently demoted.  Stopping Hysteria will not be easy since hysteria sells -- it&#39;s very profitable but educated people challenge the  Hype and ask leaders  to reverse course and report on the objective science of climate change, to stop ignoring legitimate voices this scientific debate and to stop acting as a vehicle for unsubstantiated hype. media has flip-flopped between global cooling and warming scares. <br/>At the turn of the 20th century, the elites and billionaires peddled an upcoming ice age -- and they said the world was coming to an end. In the 1930s, the alarm was raised about disaster from global warming - again they said the world was coming to an end. Then in the 70&#39;s, an alarm for another ice age was raised - again they said the world was coming to an end. And now, today we are back to fears of catastrophic global warming -- and once again they are saying the world is coming to an end.<br/>",

Hacking is a concern for my safety and any other American on the road ways. It goes against my Constitutional rights, the ELD mandate goes against the FMCSA rules for instance rule states in 49 CFR 395.8: All stops made in any one city, town, village or municipality may be computed as one. In such cases the sum of all stops should be shown on a continuous line as on-duty (not driving). The cost is a financial burden on small businesses and my family, along with every American. With the rise of every commodity in the country, due to the extra cost of freight charges. The added stress of watching a clock tick down will be added stress to each driver to run harder and push as hard as they can to get to destinations. Everything cannot be planned out perfectly at the start of each load. No one knows traffic conditions, weather, or accidents along each route and not to forget a parking place at the end of your driving day. Who says that position of scheduled stop has a parking place when you get there? Back to the added stress of one&#39;s health!!! My doctor has raised questions on this as well and voiced her concerns on all the drivers. <br/><br/>My opinion on fixing <br/>More studies on all safety issues not just saying people want to drive illegal, more rulings on new applicants coming into the trucking industry. Background checks on individuals with a mental health review. More driver training new drivers does not have this, most can&#39;t even back up into a parking spot between two other trucks. They don&#39;t see adverse driving conditions that is faced each and every day. <br/><br/>49 CFR 395 Subpart A<br/>Hours of Service needs to be addressed and consideration of change. Drive time, Breaks and total hours. First shipper and receiver&#39;s has also a very large amount of control over the driver&#39;s time. With long load and unloading times that eat up the 14 hour rule and with less drive time after waiting for hours. There also needs to be regulation put in place to be compensated for long load and unloading times. (Detention Time). <br/>Flexibility of hours needs to be considered with split sleeper berths with drive times as well. Consideration of load times and off-loading. Everyone is not the same and some can&#39;t sleep during daylight hours. And some can&#39;t drive at night sleep patterns has a huge safety concern. Safety starts with the driver first. If they are tired and frustrated due to having to drive through heavy traffic conditions as work traffic with cars cutting them off and making things harder than they need to be is a nation concern and not enough education for all drivers. With more and more people using their phones while driving has to be the number 1 cause of accidents, I will say 9 out of 10 is using their phone. Police has said it&#39;s too much paperwork to right that may tickets a day. But how many lives would be saved if they did??? <br/>As far as it making a fair playing field, How can that be I have a one truck operating business, large companies have hundreds hauling loads to one at a time. So if you take those numbers and compare it is no way a fair playing field. I support the HR-3282 Bill and ask the FMCSA to look hard at the impact of this Mandate on a nation as a whole. Ask yourself do I use my phone or have I used my phone driving home from work? <br/>The hacking may not seem possible but neither did 911 did it? And as a owner operator I ask if it does happen and I kill someone or look at it as this way if it was your spouse and kids and it was because of a hacked truck. How could you live with that?? I know I could not live with self and not to mention being sued for everything I own or have a prison sentence to face. <br/> ",

    "text": "With only 110 lbs of payload it is difficult to trade payload/endurance for safety.  However, it  has been demonstrated on a similar rotary wing drone that the autonomous flight control system can be programmed to auto-rotate the aircraft in the event of an engine failure.  This software adds no additional weight penalty.  The ability to select a suitable emergency landing site has also been demonstrated.  It is neither large nor heavy (order of 1 pound additional weight).  In this manner, the aircraft knows its total energy (altitude and airspeed) and can continuously calculate suitable emergency landing points within the &quot;total energy&quot; constraints at the moment of an engine or gearbox malfunction.  Typically, these things are done in a manned rotary wing aircraft by the pilot.  These functions can  be performed via automation which significantly enhances the safety of people and things on the ground.<br/><br/>From a sense-and-avoid standpoint, there are demonstrated systems that will enhance overall safety whether in an emergency condition or not.  The fundamental concept is to not fly into something, whether that something is another aircraft, a building, a tower, etc.  This is not difficult to implement, however the published information on the &quot;airworthiness&quot; operations do not include such a system.  Considering the aircraft is intended to be flown beyond visual sight, more serious consideration to some form of sense-and-avoid should  be mandated.<br/><br/>Information on the control link from the ground operator to the aircraft is lacking in detail.  Has a lost-link procedure been implemented?  Has a &quot;captured-link&quot; (link control by third party) been considered and mitigated?  How can the public ensure the aircraft operating in an autonomous mode, beyond line of sight of the control operator(s) will not &quot;wander off&quot; into more populated areas or into airways (ala, the navy&#39;s rotary wing drone in southern Maryland several years ago).<br/><br/>Finally, what is the certification basis of the rotary wing aircraft design and fabrication and the method of compliance with that certification basis?  Is it the same as manned aircraft (Robinson R-22 for example) or is it a Special airworthiness certification standard of some form?  Assuming it is Experimental (and not Restricted), then it is imperative that the public knows the aircraft will not deviate from its limited operating area defined by the FAA.  The information provided in the public announcement does not provide a sufficient level of confidence that the rotary wing drone aircraft will not stray out of its intended operating area.",

These should be signed by both the patient and the health care professional. 3. Copies should be given to the patient, a copy kept in the patients file.  Regular audits should be made to make sure this practice is being done. Copies can be sent to an email box that tracks these forms. 4. Health care professionals should be audited for any conflicts of interests receiving benefits from the prescribing of drugs.  5. If found guilty some action should be taken against the provider. 6. Actions can include losing the authority to dispense medications and have the local pharmacy noticed that the provider can no longer dispense drugs.  Give the patient an option to make a declaration that they want to be treated without the use of any drugs.  If the providers doesnt know how to treat without the use of drugs then they need to provide names and addresses of other providers that can treat without the use of drugs.  Patients should be educated on the signs that they have become addicted to the drugs or that the side effects they are experiencing are worse than the health problem.  <br/>What steps can FDA take with respect to dispensing and packaging (e.g., unit of use) to facilitate consistency of and promote appropriate prescribing practice; 1. Provide printed inserts describing how the medications should be used.  2. What should be avoided or consequences of mixing drugs and alcohol. 3. A phone number to call if there are adverse side effects and how to report and get help. 4. The maximum amount of medication that can be taken and the recommended length of time that it should be taken without suffering adverse effects.  5. A Clear statement that most medications are not for long term use as they can cause permanent changes to the body including addiction, damage, and death.  6. The longest time that the medication should be clearly stated, such as 14 days, 30 days maximum time to be consumed.  7.

Yes mandatory education should be implemented and certified with a certificate of completion to be on file at the business location where they work.  Education should include:  1. What side effects and risks are involved in taking the prescribed medication. 2. What other options are available and have they been tried prior to considering prescribing drugs.  For example, physical therapy, chiropractic services, acupuncture, rest and relaxation, meditation, less risky medications such as herbal preparations. 3. Classes should be offered by certified learning facilities adult classes, college classes, private schools.  4. Costs should be supplemented by the drug manufacturers and distributors since it is their responsibility to make sure health care professionals and patients are fully aware of the risks and that there are other alternative therapies.  5.

(To put into perspective, $170 billion can buy 8,500,000 Honda Civics.).<br/>CONCERNS : by 2020 an estimated 33,000 to 111,000 bats will be KILLED ANNUALLY by wind turbines in the Mid-Atlantic . Mortality from factors is substantial on long-term cumulative impacts on both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. the economic consequences of losing bats could be substantial. Loss of bats .... could lead to... agricultural losses ...estimated at more than the value of bats to Farmers and Forest , may be as low as... $3.7 billion/year and as high as $53 billion/year....... <br/>CONCERN : Wind Turbine Noise ... facility that emit a noise level known to exceed health limits, where the noise becomes &#39;intrusive and annoying&#39; is not only unreasonable, it is unconscionable and should be unlawful. Nuisance noise complaints by neighbors, studies show that turbine noise can lead to sleep deprivation and other health problems also cause Wildlife nesting issues. .<br/>CONCERN BIRDS every year 573,000 birds (including 83,000 raptors) and 888,000 bats are killed by wind turbines. Collisions of small migratory songbird species account for approximately 60% of fatalities at U.S. wind facilities . Small songbirds comprise more than 90% of all landbirds (Partners in Flight Science Committee 2013). Most songbird species are migratory.<br/>CONCERN . magnetic fields can pass through buildings, living things, and most other materials. The electric and magnetic forces in EMFs are caused by electromagnetic radiation. EMFs in the ionizing radiation part of the electromagnetic spectrum can damage DNA or cells directly. study in 1979 pointed to electric power lines and childhood leukemia. nine studies reported a twofold increase in risk of childhood leukemia among children with exposures. case-control study U.S. Air Force personnel found increased risk of brain cancer among personnel who maintained or repaired radiofrequency or microwave-emitting equipment . 2002, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Working Group classified ELF-EMFs as &quot;possibly carcinogenic ( cancer causing ) to humans,&quot;. 2015, the European Commission Scientific Committee reviewed electromagnetic fields. It found epidemiologic studies of frequency fields show an increased risk of childhood leukemia. <br/>Concern Wind turbines and Electric cars use rare-earth component of the magnets . Chinese producers capture 95% to 98% of the world market of &quot;rare-earth&quot; materials. neodymium oxides . The world&#39;s largest refinery for rare-earth metals in Kuantan, Malaysia has street demonstrations over radiation concerns, regulatory challenges, and the withdrawal of a major equipment. Each turbine constructed requires at least a couple THOUSAND pounds of Rare Earth Elements (REEs; China still produces 86 percent of the world&#39;s supply of Rare Earth Elements in 2014 and close to 60 percent of American supply was imported. Note: Per UNICEF mining cobalt material 40,000 children worked in mines in Africa, material purchased by china, battery then made in Korea, Sfety of the rare earth refinery, which is being built by Lynas, an Australian company. Lynas has been trying for several years to find a site for the permanent disposal of the roughly 20,000 tons a year of low-level radioactive waste that will be produced, and is still struggling to do so.<br/>",

    "text": "Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the Final 2018 Quality Payment Program rules and input into future regulations for this program. <br/><br/>We are a consulting practice that assists many small and mid-sized practices with MIPS reporting.  We have several suggestions for reducing the burden to small practices in the Cost Category.  Although there is no submission requirement, small practices will be faced with 30% of their 2019 MIPS score being generated through this category.  Small practices do not have the infrastructure and resources to appropriately analyze detailed cost data and take actions to directly influence costs.  The current measures and attribution methodologies are difficult to understand, with performance scored against benchmarks that are not known in advance.  While a large group with hundreds of eligible cases can hope to identify patterns and trends that suggest actions that can be taken to reduce costs over time, a small group with 20-35 eligible cases will not be able to do so.  For small practices, almost a third of their MIPS score will essentially be outside of their control.  We offer the following specific suggestions for your consideration in the 2019 MIPS program:<br/>  1) Exempt all providers in &#39;small&#39; practices (15 and fewer providers) from the Cost Category and reweight the 30% to Quality or distribute between other categories.<br/>  2) Significantly increase the minimum case volume required to score a cost measure.  While there may be statistical significance at the lower volumes you have identified (20 for PCC and 35 for MSPB), that does not mean that the patient-level data is sufficient for the provider to determine changes in processes or systems that can impact costs of future cases.  Next year&#39;s 35 hospitalized patients may well look quite different than this year&#39;s 35 patients so that steps a provider takes to change processes that reduce costs may have no effect whatsoever.<br/>  3) Specialists should be measured only on episode measures for specific procedures that they perform and should be exempt from the general cost measures such as PCC and MSPB.  <br/><br/>We are very appreciative of the inclusion of clinical experts in the development of cost measures, but would urge you to include the perspective of small, independent groups that are held accountable for costs that are outside their ability to control.<br/><br/>Thank you.",

    "text": "Agency Name: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration<br/>Docket Number: DOT-OST-2017-0069<br/>The specific reference that I am commenting on is ELD general: 49 CFR 395 Subpart B<br/>This regulation is another way for &quot;big business&quot;, the mega carriers and the ATA, to squeeze out the small businesses, in the form of Owner Operators and Small Carriers. The use of ELDs have not and will not increase safety, but they do add on to the seemingly never ending list of things small carriers will need to pay for to stay in compliance.  The ATA claims that ELDs will make trucking safer, but right now the biggest users of ELDs are the MegaCarriers, and they have the worst safety scores. Compare this to small carriers and owner operators, many  who choose not to use ELDs, who have much higher safety scores. <br/>Its fine if the Mega Carriers want to use ELDs to keep track of their drivers and their equipment. That is part of their employee management. It should not be forced onto all truckers. A small carrier, where the guy driving is the owner of the business and the equipment, does not need to keep track of himself in this way.<br/>The biggest safety issue that I see for ELDs, which is the biggest thing that makes them UNSAFE to drivers and the general public, is that the cyber security threat. Not only can an ELD be hacked, but if it is, then the hacker has direct control of the truck&#39;s motor/computer. The risk is a truck being hacked by terrorists and used as a weapon. Or even if thieves wanted to steal the load, whether it be high dollar merchandise or Hazmat materials, they could just hack the trucks computer, stop the motor and ambush the driver. Drivers already have a lot to worry about with their personal safety on the road, especially the drivers that spend most of their time living in their truck... at least right now they know if they are moving they are in control.<br/>Forcing the use of ELDs is also a violation of privacy rights, since the data will show the drivers constant location, routine, sleeping habits, and that data is accessible by 3rd parties.<br/>There is also the issue of driver coercion when and ELD is being watched by a dispatcher. Just because a driver has been on break for the legal minimum of time, does not meant that the driver would feel ready to safely operate the vehiclethey may not feel rested or there may by unsafe weather conditions. But if the ELD shows that the break is &quot;over&#39; then the dispatcher will push the driver to go. This also goes the other way, there may still be driving time left on the clock, but the driver may feel that it is safer to start their break early. The dispatcher would push them to keep going because there is still time. In these situations the driver&#39;s safety, and the public&#39;s, is put at risk but taking away their control of their own safety. Drivers are forced to follow what the ELD says or risk losing their job.<br/>ELDs do not improve safety, they actually decrease safety; and should not be forced on the whole of an industry that does not want it. Leave them as an option for business to decide individually if it is a good fit for them. <br/><br/>",

    "text": "The ELD mandate is a costly and burdensome regulation that needs to be eliminated.  My husband has driven a truck for over 20 years for small trucking companies, and more recently as an owner/operator.  The ELD mandate will be an added expense that will provide no benefit to him.  This mandate was introduced as a way to improve safety, but my fear is that it will do the opposite.  The cost of this mandate (purchasing, installing, and maintaining the device) will drive small trucking companies and owner/operators out of business, most of these drivers will be long term, experienced drivers.  The people benefiting from this will be the Mega carriers who will try to pick up the slack by hiring more new, inexperienced drivers to put on the road.  If the goal is to increase safety the solution is better driver training.  Another major concern is cyber security.  I am not comfortable knowing my husband is in a truck with something plugged into his computer that can be hacked, and at this point I have heard nothing confidently stating this could not happen.  His safety on the road, and that of the drivers around him, is first priority; until there is 100% certainty that his truck can&#39;t be hacked (steering system, brake system) this mandate should not be implemented.  Based on recent data breaches I find this uncertainty a single reason to eliminate, or at least postpone the mandate.  In addition to his safety, hacking could lead to fines or being put out of service if someone is able to alter his ELD. ",

    "text": "I fully concur with the proposed rule.  My experience stems from approximately 200 hours of traditional fixed wing flight time, and an additional 500 hours of experience in the V-22. The vast majority of the flying I&#39;ve done in the V-22 has been, for all intents and purposes, identical to my experience in fixed wing aircraft.  The V-22 is a CRM intensive aircraft that, when in horizontal flight, handles and operates just like a fixed wing airplane and requires aviators that are familiar, comfortable, and capable in complex airspace environments, not unlike the air carrier operations that call for an ATP rating.  When operating in and out of prepared surface airfields, the V-22 requires TOLD computations and calculated stall margins as well.  <br/><br/>These are examples that show the level of identicality between traditional fixed wing and V-22 operations that make the current V-22 time classification to &quot;powered lift&quot; unnecessary and wasteful.  Capable and experienced pilots are required to spend tens of thousands of dollars and take valuable time in order to qualify for a fixed wing ATP rating, when their flight experience in the V-22 is more valuable than the single engine piston time that is (economically) required to take its stead.<br/><br/>The FAA will be making a great decision to implement this rule that will ease the transition of experienced military pilots into the civilian sector, and help alleviate the impending pilot shortage that is looming over the airlines.

We have a right to expect balance in sourcing and fair analysis from our leaders  who cover the issue. must roll back this mantra that there is scientific &quot;consensus&quot; of impending climatic doom as an excuse to ignore recent science. After all, there was a so-called scientific &quot;consensus&quot; that there were nine planets in our solar system until Pluto was recently demoted.  Stopping Hysteria will not be easy since hysteria sells -- it&#39;s very profitable but educated people challenge the  Hype and ask leaders  to reverse course and report on the objective science of climate change, to stop ignoring legitimate voices this scientific debate and to stop acting as a vehicle for unsubstantiated hype. media has flip-flopped between global cooling and warming scares. <br/>At the turn of the 20th century, the elites and billionaires peddled an upcoming ice age -- and they said the world was coming to an end. In the 1930s, the alarm was raised about disaster from global warming - again they said the world was coming to an end. Then in the 70&#39;s, an alarm for another ice age was raised - again they said the world was coming to an end. And now, today we are back to fears of catastrophic global warming -- and once again they are saying the world is coming to an end.<br/>",

America has tremendous resources and developing these resources is the key to turning America around. America has 26% of the world&#39;s recoverable conventional oil resources, and that doesn&#39;t begin to include our enormous oil shale, tight oil and heavy oil resources. We also hold almost 30% of the world&#39;s technically recoverable conventional natural gas resources.

The National Academy of Sciences study assessed the effectiveness of tax credits in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, included a review of the existing literature as well as original analysis based on the authors&#39; own model. the NAS study examined the effects of tax credits for renewable transportation fuels. In that case, it found that the credits actually increased greenhouse gas emissions. It attributed that counterintuitive result to the fact that the tax credits for renewable fuels reduced the price and thus increased the consumption of motor fuels. That increase in turn outweighed any beneficial emission effects . ",

    "docAbstract": "On March 12, 2015, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) expanded the boundaries of Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (now renamed Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary or GFNMS) and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBNMS) to an area north and west of their previous boundaries.  In that rule, pursuant to a request from the United States Coast Guard (USCG or Coast Guard), NOAA announced that it would postpone the effective date for the discharge requirements in both expansion areas (defined as the areas that were added to the existing 1981 and 1989 boundaries for GFNMS and CBNMS, respectively) with regard to USCG activities.  NOAA stated the purpose of the postponement was to look at ways to address Coast Guard\u2019s concerns that the discharge regulations would impair the operations of Coast Guard vessels in, and aircraft over, the sanctuaries, and to consider, among other things, whether to exempt Coast Guard activities in both sanctuary expansion areas. This proposal considers allowing the USCG to carry out the following otherwise prohibited discharges within waters of the GFNMS and CBNMS expansion areas seaward of approximately 3 nautical miles (nm) from the shore: 1) untreated vessel sewage, 2) vessel graywater as defined by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (FWPCA), that does not meet the definition of \u201cclean\u201d as defined by the GFNMS and CBNMS regulations, and 3) ammunition and pyrotechnic (warning projectile, flare, smoke float and marine marker) materials used in USCG training exercises for use of force (live fire or gunnery) and training exercises for search and rescue (SAR) of vessels or persons in distress. No change is proposed to the regulatory prohibitions or exceptions applicable to the pre-expansion boundaries of the two sanctuaries.  A draft environmental assessment (DEA) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has been prepared for this proposed action. In formulating this proposed rule, NOAA considered a number of factors discussed more fully in the DEA, including the ability of the USCG to complete its mission requirements and the policy of facilitating uses of the sanctuaries to the extent compatible with resource protection. NOAA is soliciting public comment on the proposed rule and DEA."

Past  EPA  has failed in its obligation and simply ignores laws that require proper justification and economic analysis .including (i) Executive Order 13563; (ii) Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review); (iii) the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980; (iv) the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act; and (v) the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.  <br/>On  June 14, 2016   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)   opening statement   Instead of discouraging the domestic production of oil and gas, we should welcome it.

The (Obama ) President&#39;s energy policy was  hyper-focused on picking winners and losers and in handing over taxpayer resources to unproven ideas and technologies that, like windmills,  far too often, are completely unable to compete in the energy marketplace.  I do not believe we should be purposefully stopping or raising the cost of existing and proven energy sources - and adding to the costs of doing business or raising a family in the U.S. - in order to make alternative energy sources more attractive . I think we need to work to ensure that our tax code is designed so that it does not punish the production of any viable energy source. The fundamental question related to BLM&#39;s  is whether we as a nation want to encourage responsible energy development on the vast, multiple-use public lands of the United States, or do we want to shut it down. If the goal is to continue to discourage oil and natural gas development on federal lands, then this regulations will indeed further that goal.  Many rule are a broad new regulatory regime with no real justification as it adds cost and delay to energy development with no identified environmental benefit; duplicates yet usurps state regulation; and cannot be implemented in an efficient manner. If indeed the answer is that we want to encourage the continued environmentally responsible development of oil and natural gas on appropriate multiple-use public lands , then regulations are counterproductive to that goal and should be rescinded.<br/>",

(PMP S.A.) on May 24, 2017 for its iQOS system and three types of Heatstick products; Marlboro Heatsticks, Marlboro Smooth Menthol Heatsticks, and Marlboro Fresh Menthol Heatsticks.<br/><br/>As evidenced in PMP S.A.&#39;s MRTP applications, IQOS technology replaces the combustible element of traditional smoking with a tobacco warming process, which has been shown to produce significantly lower levels of harmful toxicants as compared to traditional cigarettes. The excessive heat produced by combustion in traditional cigarettes results in chemical reactions that create additional toxicants in cigarette smoke, which the FDA has referred to as harmful constituents that are likely to cause smoking-related diseases.<br/><br/>Additionally, data from studies performed in Japan, where the technology has been available for years, shows that 65% of iQOS technology users transition completely away from combustible cigarettes. Allowing for its use in the U.S. market would give tobacco retailers additional opportunities to provide tobacco consumers with realistic alternatives to traditional combustible cigarettes. This would in turn reduce the level of overall harm caused to the public at large by the harmful constituents found in combustible cigarette smoke. <br/><br/>As you know, the FDA has expressed its belief that it is in the best interest of tobacco consumers to adopt a &quot;Continuum of Risk&quot; paradigm, in which efforts to address the health hazards of tobacco products are directed towards the risks associated with delivery mechanisms. With this in mind, PFMA supports the modified risk tobacco product applications submitted by Philip Morris Products S.A. for its iQOS system with Marlboro Heatsticks, Marlboro Smooth Menthol Heatsticks, and Marlboro Fresh Menthol Heatsticks, and asks the FDA to issue a modification order with respect to these products under section 911(g) of the Federal Food Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering our views in this matter.

My long experience has shown me that navigable waters are the accumulation of headwaters that channel on the surface, shallow subsurface, and deep underground.  A 2017 research publication (Attachment 1 below) that summarizes 308 scientific references clearly shows the importance of ponds, small lakes, streams, and springs as the most likely to remain unpolluted for refugia to plants and animals.  These small waterbodies provide ecosystem services such as carbon and nutrient cycling, pollution control, and downstream flow regulation.<br/><br/>To ignore this relationship would be like overlooking that blood capillaries in the human body have major importance to the veins, arteries, and heart.<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/><br/>Ed Styskel<br/>545 Quail Loop<br/>Newport, WA 99156<br/>Email: edstyskel@gmail.com<br/><br/>Attachment 1:  &quot;The Importance of Small Waterbodies for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services: Implications for Policy Makers&quot;, authored by J.

These are due primarily to illegal fentanyl and other illegal analogues. <br/>2. Less than 1% of pain patients develop an addiction caused by prescription medications.<br/>3. Much of the current hysteria and misinformation is sourced from people who are not pain management physicians and who do not have any experience in treating chronic pain patients.

Now to address my first concerns: in regards to your alleged safety proponent that you have been so proudly proclaiming, your organization is DEAD wrong, and unfortunately I mean that quite literally. If you end up implementing this forced mandatory ELD mandate you will actually be achieving just the opposite, that is to say you will be decreasing the safety factors out here on the road with us exponentially!!! 1)You will have more drivers turning their trucks up i.e. going faster, more drivers going Faster is a definite recipe for disaster. 2) you will have more drivers driving tired, and fatigued Because they won&#39;t be able to pull off the road and safely take that revitalizing, rejuvenating nap that they may need to carry-on the rest of the day because they&#39;re having to race and beat the clock. This factor in itself will lead to more driving off the road, plowing into other vehicles i.e. more accidents and unfortunately more fatalities!!! Even Texas and Missouri know all about Fatigued driving, They have signs up and Amber alerts all the time stressing don&#39;t drive fatigued, give yourself a break.Last but not least the fact that when you run out of hours according to your electronic logs for your driving you have to find someplace safe to park, you may enter a lot or a Truck stop, drive around for a few minutes and there is NOT a place to park. Some drivers will end up parking right on the side of freeways highways roads etc. and putting the drivers as well as the public at large in an unsafe precarious situation and putting all in danger!!! And I&#39;ve already seen this happening.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>My proposed solution or provision for preventing the aforementioned atrocities is for you to simply NOT Force this Mandatory ELD mandate on ALL trucks and ALL drivers.I fully realize that there are drivers and companies out here that have very poor safety standards, poor safety records, high crash occurrences and even high fatality rates those are the companies and drivers that you need to focus on!! One size does not fit all, those professional drivers of us out here that are, have been, and continue to do our jobs safely diligently and respectfully and have fine if not exemplary driving records should not have to be asked let alone FORCED to change their way of living and the way they successfully do their jobs!! Also it is my understanding that some of the major carriers that have implemented or been made to implement these ELD devices have some of the worst Safety records as well as high crash and fatality rates, so it seems to me that having these ELDs really haven&#39;t been much of a solution in those regards.<br/>In closing, the people most closely affected by this Mundane forced mandatory ELD mandate in short order,  is EVERYONE!! Including all of us professional commercial drivers are friends, loved ones, children and yes even your friends, loved ones, children, as well as everyone else on Our Road Ways including pedestrians will be seriously adversely affected By this forced mandate.

They are all of a brownish color, with the exception of fruit (which doesn&#39;t taste, look, or feel fresh). I and many others refuse to eat them unless if there is no other option. They are tasteless and limp, and altogether a disgusting option. I used to eat lunch at school, and enjoy it. There was juice, chip bags, cookies, ice cream, and actual foods for lunch. That was eight years ago. Many people complain that what we have as school lunch today is healthier, but can it really be better for us when hardly anyone eats it? And I for one didn&#39;t know that pizza saturated in grease was healthy at all. I live in a small town, so many children are a part of the Backpack Buddies program, and have to eat school food everyday. Some kids just don&#39;t have time to pack lunch. I choose to bring food from home. Couldn&#39;t we help these children more by giving them food that is a pleasure to eat, but still nutritious? School lunches need to change.

Another issue is the fact that students can bring a lunch from home that is high in fat, calories, and carbs. By publishing this new rule, the USDA could find a way to bring healthier, yet more appealing lunch and breakfast options to students. In my county the food is far from balanced and nutritious. Some days the plate is completely brown and lacking any colors such as green, red or yellow. The pizza served is sopping with grease and is practically inedible in my opinion. By loosening the rules of the &quot;Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs&quot; published five years ago in 2012 food might become tastier and better for us. I believe that by finding a happy medium, the US would be doing a huge favor to its youth. A change to the limit on sodium is a big deal to me. By increasing the amount of sodium used healthy foods can be made to taste better. That would mean students would eat a variety of healthier food with the sacrifice of a bit more salt. I agree that we can&#39;t go back to deep-frying everything and eating cookies daily but it would be a breath of fresh air to eat a vegetable other than flavorless green-beans and broccoli that tastes like water.

Weakening this vital safeguard will put our health and communities in Washington state at risk. I strongly urge you to drop the repeal of the Clean Water Rule. <br/><br/>The federal government needs to do more, not less, to protect clean water and safeguard our communities. Repealing the Clean Water Rule is shortsighted and flies in the face of public opinion. More than 800,000 Americans supported the Clean Water Rule when it was proposed. It is grounded in science and the law. It is an essential tool to help us to get to goal of ensuring all of our waters are swimmable, fishable, and drinkable.<br/><br/>Assuming wetlands have zero value is not based on science and not based on economics. Wetlands have documented value for protecting downstream communities from flooding, providing drinking water recharge areas, and supporting fish and wildlife habitat.<br/><br/>In Washington State, wetlands and ephemeral streams need Clean Water Act protections to protect communities. In eastern Washington, wetlands provide important groundwater recharge zones to aquifers that provide drinking water as well as habitat for resident and migrating birds. On the Olympic Peninsula, the 2015 drought caused several streams to go dry before reaching the Strait of Juan de Fuca. In the Puget Sound region, small headwater streams are critical to downstream salmon habitat, and wetlands provide flood protection for downstream communities. Throughout Washington State, recreation and wildlife are strong economic drivers. Without protections for wetlands and small streams, our communities would suffer.<br/><br/>Please listen to the majority of Americans who expect EPA to protect clean water, not polluter profits, and stop this dangerous repeal process.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments.",

    "text": "EPA-HQ-OAR-2014-0827<br/>Comment to EPA classification of commercial vehicle glider kit as vehicles described or identified as, equipment not under new as manufactured by year of build. The glider truck industry is a strong embodiment of the nation&#39;s economy. The aspect of manufacturers in business building gliders either by original equipment assembly plants, and the finishing assembly businesses  and dealers have been the driving force behind moving the truck sales into a market that has literally been able to bring profitability back to the transportation industry in a time of increasing costs that lower bottom line profits. Those higher costs have come from the greenhouse gas emissions equipment that has placed the costs of new manufacturer of trucks beyond the margin of profitability for all transportation companies using heavy trucks in their businesses. Those costs don&#39;t stop at that point. Since there is no mechanism of support after the sale of equipment with EPA mandated equipment to reduce greenhouse gases. The after treatment systems have not been subsidized nor supported by manufacturing companies under warranty, placing the full cost of the maintenance of the added after treatment systems fully upon the end user, the operator and businesses. There has been no increase in transportation rates to support the extra cost. Smaller businesses already are under many suppressive regulations that simply can&#39;t be absorbed in costs against what the marketplace has determined acceptable.  If the systems for exhaust treatment can&#39;t be supported either by the EPA by subsidies, or by the engine manufacturer by warranty, or service of maintaining the system, the cost has been forced entirely on the end user, not once but twice. Cost of the equipment on the price of the vehicle, and the burden of maintaining the systems. <br/>I support the EPA in the decision to not classify glider kit vehicles as new. The ability of the owner to remain profitable and help drive the economy of the nation with equipment that matches the current costs of operation is paramount to all businesses depending on less expensive costs of transportation. <br/>I have personally known owners who have had costs so high with maintenance on pollution controls that they have filed bankrupt and gave the vehicle back to the finance company. That equipment was running every day and was always in the garage for EPA engine equipment. No dealer support, no subsidies, and 10&#39;s of thousands of dollars in repairs to the actual emissions sensors, ECM, and after treatment systems.<br/>I feel there are many of these diesels produced after 2010 are worse for air quality than engines of before 2010. Many are running everyday with blue smoke, white smoke, and choking smells coming from after treatment systems that either are non functioning, or beyond owners ability to support cost of maintenance. The systems are simply not easy to maintain cost, or time wise. So there is a reason for older technology having a demand. Experience has shown that these older engines were more reliable without the engine exhaust after treatment systems. The private sector and public sector just cannot support an expensive cost and maintenance of the new emissions mandates. That is evident in the intrests of operators with the glider kit industry.<br/>Safety on the highways is paramount to emissions systems, and the ability of owners to have new glider kits at reasonable costs will reduce the chance of other aging systems failing that are responsible for safety to be replaced with new. Improved braking systems, air pressure supply, new framing that is stronger, new electronic components, new suspension, and steering, that are necessary to the safe operation of the vehicle. Many reasons for a new glider kit to replace an older version of a chassis to make the highways safer, when chassis replacement is reason for the integrity of safe operation.<br/>Thank you, for the opportunity to comment, and I fully support the consideration of the ecological and economic issues in classification of glider kit vehicles, as not new manufacturer equipment.",

    "docAbstract": "EPA and NHTSA, on behalf of the Department of Transportation, are each proposing rules to establish a comprehensive Heavy-Duty National Program (Phase II) that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption for onroad heavy-duty vehicles, responding to the President\u2019s directive on March 31, 2014, to take coordinated steps to produce a new generation of clean vehicles. NHTSA\u2019s proposed fuel consumption standards and EPA\u2019s proposed carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions standards are tailored to each of three regulatory categories of heavy-duty vehicles: Combination Tractors; Heavyduty Pickup Trucks and Vans; and Vocational Vehicles. The rules include separate standards for the engines that power combination tractors and vocational vehicles. Certain rules are exclusive to the EPA program. These include EPA\u2019s proposed hydrofluorocarbon standards to control leakage from air conditioning systems in combination tractors, and pickup trucks and vans.\r\nThese also include EPA\u2019s proposed nitrousoxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions standards that apply to all heavy-duty engines, pickup trucks and vans."
