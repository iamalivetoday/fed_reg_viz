Box 8016<br/><br/>Baltimore, MD 21244-801<br/><br/>Re: Medicare Program; Revisions to Payment Policies under the Physician Fee Schedule and other Revisions to Part B for CY 2018; Medicare Shared Savings Program Requirements; and Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program [CMS-1676-P]<br/><br/>Dear Administrator Verma:<br/><br/>I write today in response to the &quot;Request for Information on CMS Flexibilities and Efficiencies&quot; in the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) CY 2018 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule. I understand that CMS is looking to maintain flexibility and efficiency and to reduce regulatory burden. One solution is the use of team-based healthcare, which utilizes a care team to provide high-value, quality care. As a radiologist assistant (RA), I am a member of the radiology care team and help my patients by giving them the much needed time to explain procedures being performed in Radiology.  I am the liaison between the Radiologists and the hospital staff physicians. I can spend more time with patients which allows the physician the much needed time to read complex cases that are now the standard of patient care in the radiology field.  I have the capability and have been credentialed to perform less invasive procedures which again frees the Radiologist to perform more complex procedures that may take time away for other duties they may have. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the services of RAs on the radiology care team have been impeded by Medicare&#39;s overly restrictive &quot;personal supervision&quot; standard, which exceeds the requirements of many states. RAs have specialized training and certification which allow them to perform certain procedures under the supervision of a physician; requiring that such services be &quot;personally supervised&quot;-meaning that the physician must be present in the same room-negates the utility of the RA as a member of the care team. This has adversely impacted the RA profession and resulted in increased Medicare patient wait times, decreased efficiency, and job losses for RAs.<br/><br/>To ensure that Medicare&#39;s regulations do not unduly burden exceptional patient care, I strongly urge CMS to modify the supervision standard for RA services from &quot;personal&quot; to &quot;direct,&quot; as permitted by state law and state scope of practice regulation.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Melissa A. Perry RPA/RRA, BSRT,R, CV<br/><br/>Doylestown Hospital, Doylestown Pennsylvania",

    "text": "Hi there! I have been the CEO of the largest, community oncology practice in Central New York for over 15 years. <br/>In those years, voluminous independent, cost efficient and highly skilled practices throughout the USA have closed, merged or<br/>been taken over by large 340B institutions.  This magnetic force is money and the propellant is called 340 B.  Our practice delivers <br/>outstanding cancer care at the lowest costs in our region.  We are extremely efficient - always seeking to provide the <br/>highest level of care in a compassionate manner.<br/><br/>Our practice spends over $50 million on drugs per year.  Imagine a 340B hospital who can buy those drugs at a 35-45% <br/>reduced rate and capture the profit.  They salivate at the idea of developing hospital based oncology programs.  <br/>Yes - a small percentage of patients will be indigent and will be the intended recipients of this program - but the majority will <br/>have adequate insurance.  The pressure these hospitals have put on extraordinarily good small, mid-sized and even large <br/>independent practices across the country has been shameful.  Often the large institutions will offer to buy the independent<br/>practices but if the practice shows no interest because they don&#39;t want to lose autonomy or efficiency or cost savings - the <br/>hospital systems will hire 5-10 oncologists, set up down the street and complete in an effort to squeeze them out...all for what?  <br/>To provide better access to cancer patients? To provide better care? To reduce costs and increase quality ..NO ... for MONEY.<br/><br/>It&#39;s wrong.  The 340B program is important for those patients with no insurance or insurance lacking the appropriate benefits<br/>to care for these people - not to create bullies who want to wipe out the unsung heroes in many communities. <br/><br/>Remember - hospitals are not required to give the savings back to patients or the community - they serve to increase profits.<br/>340B abuses effect everyone and they need to stop so the playing field of excellence is leveled. <br/><br/>The 340B university hospital is our community is a God send for those patients without insurance - we know the program is <br/>important - it just needs to be used properly.<br/><br/>I support CMS&#39; proposal to reform 340B so that hospital abuses are stopped and the program will help the people it was <br/>intended to help. <br/><br/>Thank you.",

    "text": "Dear Administrator Verma:   I am the COO at the Bedford Ambulatory Surgical Center in Bedford, New Hampshire.  We are a Medicare and AAAHC certified multi-specialty ASC, with a focus on Orthopaedics.  I am writing to strongly encourage you to remove TKA and THA from the inpatient-only list, and move them to the ASC-payable list.<br/><br/>We have been performing THA and TKA in our ASC for three years, with stellar outcomes. Many Medicare patients who are active, have a relatively low anesthesia risk, are without significant co-morbidities, and who have family members at home who can assist them would likely be excellent candidates for this surgery in our setting.  Our surgeons and anesthesia providers have spent a significant amount of time on patient selection criteria, as safety of the patient is our number one priority.   We have developed strict protocols that address patient selection, and all aspects of the patients care, including the at-home pre-operative and post-operative environment, anesthesia, pain management, and rehabilitation to maximize rapid recovery and ambulation.<br/><br/>Medicare spends much more money than necessary because these procedures are not reimbursed in high-quality, low cost facilities such as surgical centers.  We provide excellent care at a much lower cost. I strongly urge CMS to remove TKA and THA from the inpatient-only list and allow these codes on the ASC-payable list.   Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment.<br/><br/>Respectfully yours,<br/><br/>Sue Majewski, COO",

    "text": "Medicare&#39;s proposal to reform and stop abuse of the 340B drug discount program is a good idea and should be supported. <br/><br/>340B is a critically important program for uninsured, underinsured, and vulnerable sick patients and it must be protected. Unfortunately, some greedy hospitals have figured out that they can abuse the program and profit off of discounts by selling discount drugs at full price. This has led the program to grow enormously without any meaningful oversight or accountability.<br/><br/>For America&#39;s cancer patients and cancer care system, the abuses of the 340B program is causing serious problems. It is costing patients and taxpayers billions of dollars more for care that could be delivered in community oncology clinics which are more convenient and cost far less.<br/><br/>Putting profits before patients is bad for those who truly need 340B discounts and American&#39;s who rely on quality, affordable, and accessible local cancer care. This is especially true for rural and underserved communities where there are few local cancer care providers.<br/><br/>We should hold 340B hospitals to the standards of accountability and transparency that other program participants must meet. This will ensure that the public and taxpayers can truly understand how the discounts are being used. I cannot believe that hospitals can keep profits from 340B to use as they want - on executive bonuses, new luxury buildings, and other non-patient things.<br/><br/>Reform the 340B program is long overdue. I support CMS&#39; efforts to fix 340B so that it serves the patients in need who need it, not hospital bottom lines!<br/>",

    "text": "<br/>Dear Administrator Verma:<br/>I write today in response to the &quot;Request for Information on CMS Flexibilities and Efficiencies&quot; in the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) CY 2018 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule. I understand that CMS is looking to maintain flexibility and efficiency and to reduce regulatory burden. One solution is the use of team-based healthcare, which utilizes a care team to provide high-value, quality care. As a radiologist assistant (RA), I am a member of the radiology care team and help my patients by getting their procedures done in a safe and timely manner. Thus allowing the patient workflow to continue and giving each every patient the time and care they need. Being able to keep patients exams going they are not waiting all day for a test they have been NPO for plus it helps with getting the patients discharged faster which is cost savings. While I perform minor procedures this allows the other IR radiologist to perform emergent or difficult cases. But not only for the IR docs does this help my position also helps by giving more quality time for  Radiologist within the group to read  and focus on the more difficult or complex cases.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the services of RAs on the radiology care team have been impeded by Medicare&#39;s overly restrictive &quot;personal supervision&quot; standard, which exceeds the requirements of many states. RAs have specialized training and certification which allow them to perform certain procedures under the supervision of a physician; requiring that such services be &quot;personally supervised&quot;-meaning that the physician must be present in the same room-negates the utility of the RA as a member of the care team. This has adversely impacted the RA profession and resulted in increased Medicare patient wait times, decreased efficiency, and job losses for RAs.<br/><br/>To ensure that Medicare&#39;s regulations do not unduly burden exceptional patient care, I strongly urge CMS to modify the supervision standard for RA services from &quot;personal&quot; to &quot;direct,&quot; as permitted by state law and state scope of practice regulation.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Adrian Ream (RPA,RA)<br/>Radiology Associates of Nevada<br/>Las Vegas NV<br/>",

    "text": "Dear Committee Members, <br/><br/> I am writing to comment on the following:  <br/><br/>Medicare Program: Revisions to Payment Policies Under Physician Fee Schedule<br/>and Other Revisions to Part B for CY 2018; Medicare Shared Savings Program Requirements; and Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program<br/>(34) ULTRASOUND OF EXTREMITY (CPT CODES 76881 AND 76882)<br/>File code CMS-1676-6<br/><br/>I am a rheumatologist and ultrasonographer.   I am a salaried physician, and the issues I raise herein will not affect my personal income.  <br/>MY CONCERN:  <br/>Without any change in description of the services provided, the RUC recommends that the practice expense portion of the higher effort complete examination (76881) should be decreased and that of the limited exam (76882) increased so much that the limited examination will pay more than the complete examination. <br/><br/>The change in practice expense ratio appears to have been made to favor billing by a higher cost specialty that bills 78882 predominantly over the &quot;other dominant specialty&quot; who bills more 76881. (1)  The premise is that the higher cost specialty has a higher expense for producing the same product compared to other specialties, hence it should be paid more.  <br/>THERE ARE SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS:  <br/>- If the financial interest of CMS is to obtain the best services at lowest cost, then changing the PE structure to pay more to the specialty who produces the same product at higher cost makes no business sense.  <br/>- The assumption that the higher cost specialty will bill 76882 for limited exams and other specialties will continue to bill for the lower reimbursement 76881, thus saving CMS expenses, is false.  76881, although representing a more thorough and time intensive exam to both perform and document, will reimburse lower than the 76882 limited examination.  It will therefore make business sense for everyone to bill 76882 regardless of the level of effort.  Additionally, a 76882 examination is much quicker to perform and document than 76881, creating even more incentive for higher numbers of 76882 billing.  <br/><br/>CMS HAS STARTED AN &quot;ULTRASOUND FIRST&quot; INITIATIVE THAT INCLUDES ULTRASOUND OF THE SHOULDER BEFORE MRI OF THE SHOULDER.  <br/>-This makes sense to save unnecessary imaging expenses, but the shoulder examination frequently requires a complete exam, for which the remuneration would be severely cut by the RUC recommendations.  Hence, CMS will be countering its own initiative if the RUC recommendations are followed, by disincentivizing use of ultrasound and encouraging otherwise the utilization of MRI.  <br/><br/>ANY GENERALIZATION THAT 76881 REQUIRES LESS EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT THAN 76882 IS FALSE.  <br/>ANY GENERALIZATION THAT THE PRACTICE EXPENSE RATIO FOR A COMPLETE EXAMINATION (76881) IS HIGHER THAN AN INCOMPLETE (76882) EXAMINATION IS FALSE.  <br/>-A longer examination time should translate to more room time, more equipment time and more resources needed for the examination, such as sheets, towels, paper towels and disinfectant.  It must follow that the technical component of a lengthier examination would be higher.  The fact that the members of the RUC did not come to this conclusion validates the flawed approach.<br/>- In of the practice of rheumatology, ultrasound imaging requires high frequency imaging equipment with quality Doppler signaling, and this cannot be performed by low-end inexpensive machines.  We utilize high end machines for complete examinations to answer questions that impact management decisions including decisions whether or not to utilize expensive biologic medications.<br/>- The same equipment is used for studies that require either complete or partial scanning, the only difference being the time of study and the extent of documentation.   <br/>- The decrease in advanced sonographer labor time advocated by the RUC for 76881 (was 35.0 min, decreased to now zero) is not generally true in rheumatology, as the vast majority of rheumatologists who bill for ultrasound obtain advanced training in musculoskeletal ultrasound and perform the studies themselves.  It is important for us to do it this way because we perform bedside dynamic study of the patient rather than just obtaining images.  <br/><br/>I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO REJECT THE RUC RECOMMENDATION FOR CHANGE IN PRACTICE EXPENSE RATIO CHANGES TO 76881 AND 76882.  The issues surrounding billing for these two codes are complex, because the codes cover so much heterogeneity in techniques and specialty use.  Any oversimplified solution based on a flawed premise is doomed to failure.  If RUC recommendations are followed, all you will see is an influx of 76882 billing and further confusion.  Instead, to address your concerns I recommend CMS convene a group representing ultrasonographers from all specialties using extremity US to suggest better descriptions of complete exams (perhaps by joint or extremity region), and a rational remuneration structure.  <br/><br/>(1) AMA/Specialty Society RVS Update Committee Summary of Recommendations<br/>New Technology<br/>January 2017<br/>",

    "text": "I am glad you are postponing the mandatory implementation of the OAS CAHPS.  I think it is a good idea and we would willingly participate in a survey that would allow our patient satisfaction scores to be available to the public so that they could compare us with other ASCs and other HOPDS.  There are several things though that I would like to suggest be considered.<br/><br/>1.  An email version should be available.  We have been doing email patient satisfaction surveys for 6 years now.  If patients do not have an email, we provide them with a paper copy of the survey.  I feel that this way all of our patients at least have the opportunity to participate in the survey.  With MIPS and the emphasis on electronic charts and reporting, I find it in-congruent that CMS would not also make electronic surveys an option.  <br/>2.  The financial burden to implement the survey is too much.  Our current survey is less than $2 each.  Price per survey from the vendors was $10-25 each.  Also, there was a lot of variability among vendors as to what formats they would use, how many they would send out, how they would provide the results etc.  This should be standardized.<br/>3.  The EHR vendors are not prepared.  My EHR vendor only has an interface with one vendor which is not the one I want to use.  They are not prepared to help us with other vendors.  Also, they are charging $4000 for an interface for us to be able to send the data.  Then there is also a yearly maintenance fee.  So I know it would have cost me at least $7000 this year to implement the survey in addition to the staff and administrative time to set up the survey and upload the patient information.<br/>4.  We are a GI center.  I felt like many of the questions were more oriented towards surgical patients.  I know you can add your own questions, but most of the vendors were suggesting we did not do this due to the length of the survey as it is.<br/>5.  The survey collects too much demographic information that is of no value to us.<br/>6.  Currently, I receive feedback on any negative comments on my surveys.  This allows me to investigate, follow-up, make changes, and if needed, contact the patient.  It occurs a few days after the visit making it easy to follow-up and improve care.  I feel like not knowing some of the details of the survey will prevent meaningful assessment and improvement of any issues.  <br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>",

Specifically, I write in strong support of CMS&#39; interest in expanding access to ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) for procedures like cardiac catheterization that fall outside of the current CPT surgical range of codes. <br/><br/>As you know, Medicare regulations create a patchwork system of coverage rules for certain diagnostic and interventional cardiovascular (specifically endovascular) procedures. As it stands today, if a treatable cardiac condition is diagnosed in a Medicare patient at an ASC or a doctor&#39;s office, the physician generally cannot intervene immediately - even if doing so would be medically appropriate, safe, and/or common practice under other coverage options. In many cases, this means that Medicare patients must undergo the intake process, sedation, catheterization, and discharge on multiple occasions at multiple settings before they can be treated for their diagnosed condition. This can lead to situations that are potentially dangerous for patients&#39; health outcomes, not to mention financially and functionally burdensome.<br/><br/>I have been in a single specialty practice for 12 years.  I perform coronary interventions on a regular basis.  Traditionally these had to be performed in the hospital setting.  In recent years,  these patients frequently are discharged home the same day.  This is due to dramatic technological and pharmacological advances in coronary intervention/PCI.<br/><br/>We opened our outpatient facility (The Heart and Vascular Center of Bryan/College Station) in August  of 2014 and have been performing coronary intervention on patients with private insurance on a regular basis. Our patients enjoy a state of the art facility which is equipped with cutting edge technology and run on a safe and efficient platform.  Our outcomes are excellent and our cost is lower than that which occur in the hospital setting.  The reason for this is due to our high efficiency and low waste of products.  We perform only one service line and this allows us to become highly reliable.  Our patient satisfaction is near 100% very satisfied and we have the data to back this up.  <br/><br/>Medicare regulations have not kept pace with changes in state law that increasingly allow for these procedures to take place in stand-alone facilities. Furthermore, the current ASC covered procedures list, which considers primarily the procedures grouped in the CPT surgical range of codes, with some exceptions, does not reflect advancements in technology and updated clinical guidelines with respect to ASCs. Most importantly, the current definition of &quot;covered surgical procedure&quot; does not consider advancements in endovascular interventions like percutaneous coronary intervention, which enable us to treat cardiac conditions using minimally invasive techniques in sophisticated, stand-alone cardiac catheterization laboratories. This results in Medicare beneficiaries receiving care that is often more expensive - both for the Federal government and the patient - while being logistically burdensome and clinically disadvantaged. <br/>In light of these considerations, I fully support the proposal to modernize Medicare coverage and payment rules for cardiovascular procedures in the ASC setting, which would bring the program more up to date with commercial payers, technological advancements, and clinical guidelines.<br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/>Lane Miller, M.D., FACC, FSCAI<br/>",

Then once I surrendered my mail in ballot and voted on the standard ballot I was once again instructed to insert to the provisional box. In my push for correction I was finally permitted an actual normal  and correct placement in the standard box.<br/><br/> I do believe the primary vote in a different year  (memory fails me) made an effort to supply me with 2 ballots. I noted that neither in that year had bar codes which would definitely be one way to skew legitimacy (without bar codes how does one balance the vote count to ballot count?) <br/><br/>This recent 2016 election the same efforts occurred to keep my vote from the regular box count by instructing I put my card in the provisional box once more. Armed with tenacity learned in past years and some re-education My vote was properly cast to the regular box.<br/><br/>I would like to add that my knowledge of the games played at the polling stations by not so well intended or educated poll station workers was founded in membership in conservative clubs where I became aware of the Election Integrity Projects efforts to expand political awareness of the lack of integrity so common in California!",

Residents of the United States must be vigorously encouraged to exercise their right to vote, because it equates to their right to be represented in all levels, houses and branches of government. The current state of electoral politics exists because the Congress has not yet had the courage to pick up the gauntlet thrown down by the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. FEC. Regular citizens currently have almost no meaningful participation in government beyond their exercise of the vote in highly media-influenced, thus money-pivoted elections. In addition extreme partisan gerrymandering has resulted in nominally powerful majorities of citizens having to subsist politically with little or no representation in government for long stretches during recent times. <br/><br/>The mandate of one person one vote should extend as evenly as possible throughout this great land and into every demographic substrate regardless of income or historical barriers to participation. When considering public perceptions of fairness in elections, this committee must err on the side of actually opening as widely as possible fair and well-attended elections. Do not allow the fears of a small and perhaps justly declining plurality of white Christian nationalists to guide your committee into repeating grave errors of judgement that stretch deep into this nation&#39;s scarred past, beginning with the acceptance of the institution of chattel slavery within these constitutional United States, and continuing today with an unspeakably vast mass incarceration of persons of African-American descent and diminution of Minority votes by extremely partisan practices of drawing districts safe for incumbent powers but also just happening to reduce the electoral voice of poor and Minority voters. Do nothing in your deliberations that could be remotely construed as restrictive of any person&#39;s right to vote. I should think this goes without saying, but many things I took for granted in the past have begun to show signs of weakness, such as the role of the educated common voter, the role of the press in disseminating truth in political discourse and in holding miscreant political actors accountable for thwarting the express political will of the American majority in policy decisions and legislative actions, and taxation attending honest political representation.",

There are serious administrative and cost burdens the survey would place on my facility, and the following should be addressed before CMS mandates this survey:<br/>Adding an electronic survey option. Internet access and email accounts are common in today&#39;s society, and I believe that CMS should add an electronic mode as an option for conducting the OAS CAHPS survey. This will also reduce the cost of administering the survey, as phone and mail options are cost-prohibitive.<br/>Survey length.The survey should be significantly shortened. The inclusion of 13 demographic questions in the &quot;About You&quot; section of the survey is excessive. In addition, 24 questions regarding the patient&#39;s experience is extremely high. Our facility has found we achieve the highest response rate with short, concise surveys of no more than 5-10 questions. Our fear is that the return rate for a 37-question survey will be extremely low, and patients and facilities will not be able to glean any meaningful information due to low responses rates.<br/>Required number of completed surveys. Requiring 300 completed surveys would be burdensome for my ASC, as well as many other facilities. ASCs are often small businesses, with two or fewer operating rooms. When inpatient hospitals were first required to utilize the HCAHPS survey, they only had to achieve 100 completed surveys. Setting higher expectations from the start for smaller providers like ASCs is unreasonable, and I request that if you make the survey mandatory in the future, the initial requirement be set at 100 completed surveys.<br/>",

The Aquablation procedure is a new and novel form of treatment for benign prostatic hypertrophy. It has levels of complexity that are similar to cryoablation of the prostate and high intensity focused ultrasound of the prostate. Both of which are cancer procedures. The complexity of instrumentation is paramount in this procedure. Similar to treating the prostate with cryoablation and HIFU, Aquablation requires trans-rectal ultrasound preplanning and live monitoring during treatment. The level 4 APC coding does not take into account the relative cost for the device and the overhead to comparable procedures. More complex cases with 5376 (level6) designation such as HIFU,  Cryoablation and Interstitial seed implantation all need more sophisticated equipment to perform the procedure and appropriately trained personnel to help manage and run the computerized machinery.  It would not be possible for the physician to perform these tasks alone during the procedure. Unlike level 4 designated procedures, the required equipment for this procedure is not reusable. Even transurethral resection of the prostate and laser ablation of the prostate or level  designated procedures because of the complexity of the equipment and time involved for completing the procedure. I would strongly encourage &quot;the powers that be&quot; to look again at the APC designation for Aquablation and consider a level 5 (5375) if not more appropriately a level 6 (5376) designation.<br/><br/>",

I have been utilizing drug-coated balloons since their release approximately 18 months ago. My success rate and long-term patency rate have been outstanding and significantly better than prior technology.<br/>In the current CY 2018 hospital OPPS and ASC payment systems and quality reporting programs Rule, CMS is proposing to eliminate payments for drug-coated balloons and bundle those payments within the payments of existing procedures. The CY 2018 OPPS proposed rule does not include a provision to create new coding or differentiate payment for procedures involving DCBs. CMS has proposed to package the device costs of DCBs into the costs of the procedures with which the device is utilized, effective January 1, 2018. This means angioplasty procedures with DCBs and plan balloons will receive the same payment amount. <br/>The clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of DCB angioplasty have been well established through randomized controlled trials and large-scale, population based observational studies. CMS&#39; approval of both inpatient and outpatient temporary add-on payments for DCBs was in recognition that DCBs represent a significant clinical improvement in the treatment of PAD relative to plain balloon angioplasty catheters when compared to drug-coated balloon therapy.<br/>We believe an appropriate payment structure after the expiration of these add-on payments is important to avoid patient access barriers to a technology that reduces repeat interventions for patients and healthcare costs to Medicare. A separate payment structure for DCBs should be established to eliminate significant barriers to access for this superior treatment modality.<br/><br/>DCBs have demonstrated a significant reduction in loss of patency; lower rates of revascularization; a decrease in recurrent symptoms; sustained clinical improvement; and a reduction in follow-up costs.<br/> <br/>Long-term follow-up data from a pivotal three-year randomized control trial and real-world observational study data confirm that DCB provides significant improvement in patient clinical outcomes and savings to the healthcare system: <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>DCB therapy offers continued improvement in patency at three years[1], [2], 4, 5 <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>DCB therapy offers the lowest reported reintervention rate of all available SFA technologies1-5 <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>DCB therapy offers better clinical outcomes, reduced reinterventions, and savings in total costs at 2 years. <br/>[1]Laird JR, Schneider PA, Tepe G, et al.

Ongoing research continues to demonstrate that the presence of an anesthesiologist for routine colonoscopy increases the satisfaction of both the patient and the gastroenterologist while improving the safety of the procedure by providing a specialist to care for the patient&#39;s airway and physiological concerns while the gastroenterologist focuses on completing the procedure. <br/> <br/>If CMS&#39;s proposed rule change goes into effect, commercial carriers will follow resulting in a significant reduction in overall anesthesia reimbursement for endoscopic procedures based on non-clinical valuation methodology previously cited. This may result in access issues for patients as facilities that already struggle to break even on their procedures may see this move as further disincentive to offer this important procedure.",

It is costing patients and taxpayers much more for cancer care that could be delivered in local, affordable community oncology clinics.<br/><br/>No one disagrees that 340B is a critically important safety-net program for needy patients. Unfortunately, the program has grown tremendously because some greedy hospitals have figured out that they can abuse the program and profit off of discounts without any oversight or accountability.<br/><br/>Putting profits before patients is bad for those who truly need 340B discounts and American&#39;s who rely on quality, affordable, and accessible local cancer care. This is particularly important for rural and underserved communities where there are few cancer care options.<br/><br/>340B hospitals should be held to high standards of transparency and accountability, so that government and the public understand exactly how the discounts are being used. It is shocking that hospitals can pocket 340B profits for use on bonuses, buildings, and more. In addition to accountability, we need public reporting from all program participants.<br/><br/>I want you to know that I stand firmly in support of Medicare and CMS as it works to reform 340B. It is time to reform the 340B program so that it serves patients in need, not hospital profits!<br/>",

    "text": "Dear Secretary of State,<br/><br/>I am very opposed to this information collection for many reasons.  <br/><br/>First, this policy will result in racial and religious profiling.  Government employees who issue visas would have essentially unfettered discretion in choosing who to target for extreme vetting.  Even in the best of times, unfettered discretion and a lack of protection lead to increased racial profiling.  In times such as these where the President and many top government officials have expressed clear hostility toward Muslims, proposals such as this are especially prone to lead to unconstitutional and immoral treatment.  <br/><br/>The social media collection is particularly troubling.  Social media is very language-, culture-, and context-specific, and State officials are bound to make mistakes when interpreting peoples social media posts, and those mistakes can have devastating consequences for visa applicants.  It is also particularly dangerous for human rights defenders and democracy activists who live in repressive regimes. They rely on anonymous online identities to further their activism while maintaining at least some small amount of safety from government reprisals; destroying that anonymity by forcing them to link their online presence to their official identities while they are abroad in the country they fear reprisals from is a cruel condition to set for obtaining a visa.<br/><br/>The travel history requirement is absurdly burdensome; I would ask Department of State officials to try to figure out their travel history for the last fifteen years, and include every source of income used for each of those travels.  Most of us cannot even begin to remember which friends we shared travel costs with, or which trips our family members may have contributed some small amount of money to.  If most of us would be unable to collect this information, why are we demanding it of visa applicants, especially when the consequences of not giving complete or accurate information could be as severe as a visa denial that could separate family and friends?<br/><br/>The proposal will end up hurtingnot helpingU.S. security interests.  The information you are asking for is invasive and irrelevant.  There is no evidence that the collection of this personal information and social media handles will lead to more security.  For these reasons and many, many more, I oppose this proposal.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Marjory Keean",

    "text": "Re: Docket No. OLP 164<br/><br/>To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing on behalf of the Advocacy Center of Louisiana, the protection and advocacy system for the State of Louisiana. Among other functions, we provide legal representation to individuals with disabilities who have been discriminated against in violation of Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The regulations implementing those Titles are found at 28 C.F.R. Chapter I, parts 35 and 36, and are thus covered by the referenced request for public comment. These comments are limited to the ADA implementing regulations.<br/><br/>The Department of Justice (the &quot;Department&quot;) seeks comment on the &quot;various kinds of actions taken by the Department&#39;s components that the public perceives to be regulatory in nature even if they are issued in a form other than rules promulgated upon notice and comment,&quot; meaning an action that &quot;imposes binding requirements [or] states criteria that a Department component will use to assess compliance with such a binding requirement.&quot;<br/><br/>In the context of the ADA, such actions might be consent decrees or other settlement agreements secured and published by the Department, as well as technical assistance manuals or other guidance materials. With respect to consent decrees and settlement agreements, these achieved pursuant to the Department&#39;s fulfilling its statutory duties in response to actual complaints. See 42 U.S.C.  12188(b). The Department&#39;s exercise of its investigatory and enforcement authorities is a crucial component of the vindication of the civil rights of people with disabilities.<br/><br/>The Technical Assistance Manuals issued regarding Titles II and III are likewise invaluable. In many cases, the Manuals restate or provide further explanation of the statutory and regulatory requirements. The ADA Technical Assistance Manuals additionally provide context drawn from the larger body of civil rights law that is useful in interpreting the ADA. See, e.g., ADA Title III Technical Assistance Manual, III-1.6000. In other words, the Technical Assistance Manual makes explicit information that is contained implicitly in the statutory reference to other law. This function is useful to both individuals with disabilities who seek plain-language explication of the extent of their rights under the ADA and entities charged with following the statute.<br/><br/>The Department additionally issues materials that assist consumers and service providers alike in understanding the issues at hand. In some cases these materials provide business or public entities with needed context to understand their obligations. For example, Department materials provide information on the way many Deaf individuals communicate, which is critical to understanding whether a communication modality is effective, the standard required by law. To be clear, these materials do not expand the statutorily prescribed rights; they rather provide useful information so that entities can understand the relevant issues in determining how best to comply with the law.<br/><br/>The Department additionally seeks suggestions regarding regulatory actions that should be repealed, replaced, or modified in furtherance of Executive Order 13777.<br/><br/>We know of no such regulations in the context of the ADA. The ADA regulations and architectural standards have been promulgated after much research and deliberation, in consultation with business owners, individuals with disabilities, architects, and other experts. The Department undertook substantial revisions to both Title II and Title III regulations, resulting in revised and repromulgated regulations in 2010. The resulting regulations reflect a balance between the needs of people with disabilities and business owners, in some cases clarifying the statutory limitations of the ADA, while explicitly rejecting the proposals of disability advocates, who called for more expansive protections. While we do not in all cases agree with the results, we respect the deliberative process the Department undertook, spanning two presidential administrations, to arrive at the regulations as they exist today. We urge the Task Force to reject further amendments to these regulations without employing the same careful consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Susan Meyers<br/>Director of Policy and Community Engagement<br/>Advocacy Center of Louisiana<br/>",

    "text": "Removing total knee arthroplasty from the inpatient only list will place a major strain on rural hospitals with only a few specialty surgeons, orthopedic being one of them.  In the proposed rule, it is mentioned that &quot;just because a procedure is not on the IPO list does not mean that the procedure cannot be performed on an inpatient basis.&quot;  However, to qualify a patient for inpatient status, you must have a reason for the patient to stay over two midnights that is medically necessary.  If the procedure performed by the orthopedic surgeon is one where it takes 2 days during the normal recovery period for an uncomplicated case post op, this is standard care that would require inpatient over 2 midnights.  How are the surgeons supposed to develop their own protocol for determining who should be done as an outpatient vs inpatient and can they use their &quot;physician exception&quot; and make all of their cases inpatient?  This will send the hospitals and RACs into a state of ambiguity.  Who is to say the RACs won&#39;t come back and deny all of the cases that were inpatient for lack of medical necessity but based on physician exception was made inpatient?  Also, in rural areas many patients do not have the home life/support structure/community resources to provide care to these patients outpatient.If a patient&#39;s comorbid condition is uncontrolled, making them &quot;high risk&quot; it is unlikely that the patient will be undergoing an elective surgery such as joint replacement so that standard cannot be used.  Your statement suggests that a patient nwith comorbidities who does not have a good home support system can be admitted as inpatient for their total joint replacement, even if those comorbidities and the surgery do not lead the doctor to have an expectation of a two midnight medically necessary hospital stay.  How is a doctor to determine the number and type and severity of comorbid conditions which warrant inpatient admission? ",

Humphrey Building<br/>200 Independence Avenue, SW<br/>Washington, DC 20201<br/><br/>Re: CMS-1678-P - Medicare Program: Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Systems and Quality Reporting Programs<br/><br/>Dear Administrator Verma:<br/><br/>I am an anesthesiologist and medical director at Sutter Amador Surgery Center which is a small rural ASC in the state of California.  My ASC focuses on GI endoscopy, pain management, cataract surgery, podiatry, and orthopedics and Medicare beneficiaries constitute approximately 70% of our case volume.  I am writing to urge you to make the policy change necessary to halt the growing disparity between ASC and hospital outpatient department (HOPD) payments by using the same update factor for both settings. This will ensure that ASCs remain a viable high-quality, lower-cost option for patients.<br/>Researchers at the University of California-Berkeley found that ASCs saved Medicare program and its beneficiaries $7.5 billion during the four-year period from 2008 to 2011 over what would have been paid if care had been provided in other settings. The Berkeley researchers also project that ASCs have the potential to save the Medicare system an additional $57.6 billion over the next decade if policymakers take steps to encourage the use of these innovative healthcare facilities within the Medicare system.<br/>Similarly, in addition to the large number of outpatient procedures that can appropriately be done in an ASC, there are a few procedures that should absolutely be mandated by CMS to be done in an ASC when available because these procedures are safe and straightforward and cost significantly less when done in an ASC.  These procedures include cataract surgery, pain management procedures, most podiatry, and non-emergent GI endoscopy procedures.  <br/>ASCs have achieved cost savings and produced high-quality outcomes in spite of CMS policies. <br/>Under this proposed rule, Medicare would be reimbursing HOPDs approximately twice as much for performing the same procedures when performed in ASCs. This disparity is due in part to the fact that a different update factor is used for each of the settings. At some point, it becomes economically unfeasible for my facility to continue to perform Medicare cases, which hurts patients and limits their access to high-quality outpatient surgical care.<br/>As a medical director/anesthesiologist and tax payer, I believe we need to work together to find cost effective solutions that enable our citizens to receive timely and appropriate care. By updating ASCs using the same update factor as HOPDs - the hospital market basket, this will stop the growing disparity in payments between HOPDs and ASCs. That will allow ASCs to continue to provide quality surgical care for the millions of Medicare patients who depend on our services.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Vicki Chew, MD<br/>Medical Director and board-certified anesthesiologist<br/>Sutter Amador Surgery Center<br/>223 Clinton Rd. #204<br/>Jackson, CA 95642<br/>",

Our facilities participate in the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program. I was happy to see that CMS proposed to delay the five new measures based on the use of the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Outpatient and Ambulatory Surgery (OAS CAHPS). There are serious administrative and cost burdens the survey would place on our facilities, and the following issues should be addressed before CMS mandates this survey.<br/>Lack of electronic survey option. Internet access and email accounts are common today, and I believe that CMS should add an electronic mode as an option for conducting the OAS CAHPS survey. This will also reduce the cost of administering the survey, as phone and mail options are cost-prohibitive for my facility.<br/>Survey length. The survey should be significantly shortened, focusing on actionable aspects of patient experience in the outpatient setting. The inclusion of 13 demographic questions in the &quot;About You&quot; section of the survey is excessive. Only those items that are required by law or that would be used in patient-mix adjustment for public reporting purposes should be included. Based on our review of the factors used in the patient-mix adjustment for CAHPS surveys, only the items that identify self-reported health status (item 25), age (item 27), education (item 29), primary language other than English (item 33) and a proxy respondent (item 36) should be retained. Federal data collection requirements regarding sex, race, ethnicity, and primary language can be met with items 28, 30, 31, 32 and 33. The other four items (26, 34, 35 and 37) are not essential. In fact, the US Office of Minority Health clearly identifies items 34 and 35 as optional in its implementation guidance. It is not reasonable to ask ASCs to shoulder the additional cost of items that are optional and non-essential, and these items should be removed. <br/>In addition, 24 questions regarding the patient&#39;s experience is extremely high. If we would choose to add our own questions, those we have used in the past and believe to be important information to collect to enhance the patient experience in our facility, this could become a 52-question survey. Our facility has found we achieve the highest response rate with short, concise surveys of no more than 5-10 questions. Our fear is that the return rate for a survey five to ten times that length will be extremely low, and that patients and facilities will not be able to glean any meaningful information due to low responses rates. <br/>Required number of completed surveys. Requiring 300 completed surveys would be burdensome for my ASC, as well as many other facilities. ASCs are often small businesses, with two or fewer operating rooms. When inpatient hospitals were first required to utilize the HCAHPS survey, they only had to achieve 100 completed surveys. Setting higher expectations from the start for smaller providers like ASCs is unreasonable, and I request that the initial requirement be set at 100 completed surveys. <br/>I commend CMS for reevaluating this survey and hope that the issues outlined above are addressed before CMS chooses to make it mandatory. <br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Nancy Ledgerwood, RN<br/>Director of ASC Quality and Regulatory Compliance<br/>4000 Meridian Blvd<br/>Franklin, TN 37067<br/>",

I called the 800 number to report voter fraud and was told to let it go.  At the Hartnell college in Salinas they were allowing electioneering 50 ft from the open door of the polls.  We had security make them move back to 100 ft.  When working at phone banks to get out the vote, many times we were told that person died or moved.  Over and over.  We turned in our findings but the next cycle the same people that had died or moved were still on the rolls.  I have seen folks come in to the polling place, say they can&#39;t remember the name they are registered under to vote, and the worker looks up the address and starts naming names for them to be!  My husband and I have even gone down to the registrars office and ask to speak to the registrar about this illegal voting.  I asked him how he can determine who is legally able to vote when everyone is registered when they get a drivers license.  He said, &quot;we believe people are inherently honest.&quot;  There is way too much voter fraud in this state.  Help!!  When a polling place closes up and counts the vote and locks the box(with a twist tie) two workers must escort the votes to the registrars office, together.  But, they don&#39;t wait for you to lock up and follow along.  They leave, you lock up, then drive to election office, but they aren&#39;t there yet.  Where did they go?  We&#39;re votes added, taken out, thrown away?  Illegal voter fraud is alive and well in California!",

In Albuquerque, the hospital acquired 340b pricing and then in 2012 threatened my practice.  We are an independent oncology practice and in 2012 we were informed by the hospital/health plan (Presbyterian Health care Services) that we were to acquire a list of oral and injectable drugs from their 340b hospital pharmacy for the patients treated by us but ensured by their Medicare Advantage plan.  They publicly announced by letters to patients and in the newspaper that this would save the patients money.  At that time, it was clear that the savings would only accrue to the health plan, not to Medicare and not to patients, so we challenged their plans in part of an anti-trust lawsuit as a tying arrangement.  I also reported them to OPA.<br/><br/>However, your new directive to pay hospitals ASP-22% would in part give some of the discount back to CMS for Medicare patients and would hopefully lower the out of pocket costs for Medicare patients.  <br/><br/>Hospitals across the country have been using the 340b discount as leverage to increase marketshare.  This has resulted in the acquisition of practices by hospitals, those billing at the higher HOPPS level rather than the PFS level, and has eliminated practices from the tax base of the communities in which they reside.  With a decreased market for pharmaceutical companies to sell their products at list price, the prices offered by Pharmaceutical companies have increased to stay ahead of the required 340b discount.  <br/><br/>This increase in price has also threatened the viability of the community practices, as we must pay our distributor long before the payers other than CMS pay us.  As the ASP rises, and we cannot afford to stockpile drugs, practices are also finding that the 6 month old ASP price is below our acquisition prices for many expensive drugs.  <br/><br/>Many studies across the country have shown the increase in payments, drug use and the decrease in charity care by the new 340b hospitals.  I will not repeat them here.<br/><br/>A solution that would truly benefit the patients would be to declare certain classes of patientsIndigent, Medicaid, Medicare, VA and IHS patients-- to be 340b patients.  This way any provider chosen by the patient would be able to access the discounts, making it less expensive to treat these patients.  Their copays would be less as well.<br/>340b would not be a profitable process for anyonehospital or independent practice.  It would truly be a service to poor people and governmental payers.<br/>",

Please also take into consideration and that have I have been taking opioids as directed by my Physician and at no time have taken them any other way for 2 years now due to my chronic level of pain and no other options available to me.  I have been diagnosed with Failed fusions in lower lumbar, DDD, Osteoarthritis throughout my entire body, Osteoporosis in my lower lumbar, fusion of my cervical area, herniated discs in my thoracic area, spondylosis, severe arthritis in both knees and pain due to massive injuries to my nerves throughout my entire spine. I had been at a pain level between 5-6 before my Physician was forced to lower my dose due to the CDC&#39;s current actions to pull the medication off the market or reduce the dose to an unbeneficial dose. I am now suffering with a current pain level of 9-10+, unable to sleep more than 4 hrs a day and forced to stay in bed due to movement causing horrible pain and heart palpitations along with sweating from the pain. Previously to the reduction in my dose of medication I was able to get out of the house a few days a week for several hours, shop with assistance and visit family or friends. Now I am so depressed I am unsure how much more I can physically and mentally take and how much longer I can go on with this amount pain. I certainly hope that those of us whom are suffering as I am can be considered on a case by case basis. I&#39;ve already been told by my Neurosurgeon at U of PA that there is no surgery that can fix my lower spine and ease some of that pain and the destruction to my spine will continue to worsen. Any surgery to my lower lumbar would leave me paralyzed because of the failed fusion that had not been done improperly and caused severe damage to the area and started the need for other medication to help with the pain back in 2003 which no longer helps with any of the pain. Please help me be able to gain some of my life back, I am only going to be 53 and would like to be well enough to spend time with my grandchildren and visit family out of my state. I am begging for mercy as without the medication that was providing me with enough comfort to allow me some quality of life is being taken away from me because my Physician whom is specialized in Pain Management fears he will lose his license to practice medicine by continuing to provide me the previous beneficial dose that helped me function.

Humphrey Building<br/>200 Independence Avenue, SW<br/>Washington, DC 20201<br/><br/>Re: CMS-1678-P - Medicare Program: Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Systems and Quality Reporting Programs<br/><br/>Dear Administrator Verma:<br/>My name is Steven S. Chang M.D.  I am a surgeon practicing in the State of California.  I am writing to encourage you to remove total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) from the inpatient-only list, and also move these codes to the ASC-payable list.  <br/>Traditionally, these cases have been done as an inpatient with a hospital stay of up to several days and at a relatively high cost. Now, due to less invasive techniques, improved peri-operative anesthesia, alternative postoperative pain management and expedited rehabilitation protocols, these types of procedures are being done safely and effectively in outpatient facilities such as ASCs. <br/>I personally have been providing outpatient surgical services in my community for approximately 5 years with excellent outcomes.  I have consistently advocated for Medicare beneficiaries to be able to receive outpatient surgery for many years since in our community these outpatient programs generate as good as or better outcomes and results in a faster recovery than a traditional inpatient joint replacement. This results in a much high value to my patients as measured by an optimum combination of outcomes, patient satisfaction and cost. Over my career my colleagues and I have witnessed many types of surgery including ENT, gynecology, general surgery, ophthalmology, urology and orthopedic that were once inpatient only procedure now routinely performed on an outpatient basis in the ASC. This has resulted in improved care to our patients. Moving TKA and THA into the ASC is a natural progression of this evolution.<br/>Medicare patients who are active, have a relatively low anesthesia risk, are without significant co-morbidities, and who have family members at home who can assist them are be excellent candidates for an outpatient TKA or THA procedure The decision of where and when a TKA or THA should take place should be between the patient and their surgeon. Patient choice is an essential element of our health care system and denying Medicare beneficiaries the option to pursue an outpatient TKA or THA is unwise.<br/>Surgeons and anesthesilogists who perform TKA and THA and other procedures in an ASC setting know the importance of careful patient selection and strict protocols to optimize outcomes. These protocols manage all aspects of the patient&#39;s care, including the at-home preoperative and postoperative environment, anesthesia, pain management, and rehabilitation to maximize rapid recovery and ambulation. <br/>Medicare, its beneficiaries and taxpayers are spending more money than necessary because these procedures are not reimbursed in lower-cost, highly-regulated settings such as ASCs. I strongly urge CMS to remove TKA and THA from the inpatient-only list and allow these codes on the ASC-payable list.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Steven S. Chang M.D. FASMBS<br/>2 Upper Ragsdale Dr Suite B230<br/>Monterey, CA  93940<br/>",

That is why I am urging the Department of Education NOT to repeal, replace, or modify current civil rights regulations. The Department should also preserve all current significant guidance documents, such as the guidance on: sexual harassment (including the April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter containing guidance on sexual violence) ; racial and disability-based harassment; access to athletic opportunities; gender equity in career and technical education; equal access to educational resources; nondiscriminatory school discipline; racial diversity programs; the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools; restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities; and the rights of English language learners.<br/>Federal civil rights laws protect students from discrimination on the basis of sex (Title IX); race, color and national origin (Title VI); and disability (Americans with Disabilities Act, Rehabilitation Act, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). To be effective, however, the federal government must enforce the law, provide oversight, and proactively work to ensure that students rights are realized. Current regulations and guidance help make students rights a reality and must be maintained.<br/>Please use your influence to maintain current regulations and guidance documents for the benefit of future generations, as well as the present generations that are affected by civil rights regulations. I have lived through earlier decades which saw great disparity between men and womens opportunities, as well as severe limitations on opportunities available to persons in minorities.

    "text": "I am 25 years old and have severe anxiety and depression, and I also suffer PTSD  from an assault a few years ago. I used to be unable to leave my home. I struggled to get to work, and I struggled with finding the right medication to make my symptoms manageable without so many side effects. While I still have moderate PTSD and severe anxiety and depression, I am now able to hold down a full time job with private benefits. I am now able to contribute to society and pay taxes rather than receive disability benefits or Medicaid. This is because my doctor recommended cannabidiol (CBD) in addition to my antidepressants. CBD produces absolutely zero psychotropic or &quot;high&quot; effects and does not alter my mind in any way. It produces a relaxing effect, encourages my appetite, nearly eliminates nightmares completely, and even helps my teeth because my jaw is no longer clenched after I use CBD. To me, including CBD in the same classification as THC would be erroneous. THC makes you high, but I have taken large doses of CBD and never felt high or had the &quot;munchies&quot; or been unable to think clearly. I use CBD even before work at my very demanding office job where I must have a clear head. While my conditions are by no means cured by CBD, it makes a noticeable difference that enables me to manage my symptoms better. If it were not for CBD and the legal status of CBD, it is very possible that I would no longer be a productive member of society and I would likely be unable to work. To think that CBD may be classified in the same category as narcotics and psychotropic substances seems at odds with the actual effects of CBD. Thank you for reading about my experience with this very beneficial substance. ",

The original rule, when first proposed, garnered over a million public comments--overwhelmingly in favor of the proposed regulations, reflecting the public&#39;s concern about the effects of fracking on groundwater supplies.<br/>2. The assertion that the regulations would be &quot;too costly&quot; are belied by the Administration&#39;s own estimates--that the compliance costs would only be 0.1 to 0.2 percent of the cost of drilling a well.<br/>3. Events surrounding the explosion of the Arkema plant in the Houston area are a reminder of the problems of de-regulation.  Texas does not require such plant operators to publicly disclose what chemicals are present--leaving local governments, fire-fighters and other first responders, and citizens without necessary information in the event of an accident (1).  Texas law forbids many localities from establishing fire-codes (such as preventing construction of hazardous facilities near neighborhoods and schools, and does not require installation of sprinkers (2).  As a result, no one knows what chemicals are being released into the air or water as a result of the Arkema explosions.<br/>4. The original rule regarding fracking, up for reconsideration here, required transparency of the corporations involved, and required steps to protect public water supplies--requirements that are precisely what is missing in the hazardous sites now posing a threat as a result of Hurricane Harvey, in Texas.<br/>5. When announcing the appointment of the acting head of BLM, Sec. Zinke remarked, &quot;BLM is in the energy business.&quot;  Here&#39;s what BLM&#39;s website says about its mission: &quot;The Bureau of Land Management&#39;s mission is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of America&#39;s public lands for the multiple use and enjoyment of present and future generations...The BLM manages for multiple use across regions and landscapes, with partners and using sound science.&quot;  The words &quot;PUBLIC,&quot; &quot;HEALTH&quot; and &quot;SOUND SCIENCE&quot;  are important.  <br/>6. In short, it is REASONABLE and RESPONSIBLE to require corporations making use of public lands to be transparent, and to take steps that have a reasonable per-well cost to protect public health.   Recission of these requirements is NOT in the public interest, and is unwarranted by the scientific and economic facts.<br/><br/>SOURCES:<br/>(1) http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/texas/chemical-breakdown/<br/>(2) https://www.propublica.org/article/the-fire-sprinkler-war-state-by-state",

    "text": "Administrator Verma<br/><br/>On behalf of NAMI Kansas, I am reaching out to CMS to express our concerns about the current policy for the pricing of biosimilar products. NAMI Kansas is a state-wide organization working to provide leadership, support, advocacy, and education about mental illness. We envision a future where mental illness will no longer thwart a person&#39;s fulfillment of their potential. People with mental illness are entitled to have access to treatment that will help them overcome their disorders. It is because of our passion for advocating for equal and quality healthcare that we are concerned about the CMS blended reimbursement policy. NAMI Kansas is hopeful that in the context of the 2018 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule final rule, that this policy will be reversed. Instead of blending prices for multiple biosimilars into a single code with one payment rate, we believe that each biosimilar should be assigned a unique HCPCS code for billing and payment. Over 70 physician, patient and industry stakeholders, as well as 20 Senators and 33 Representatives were opposed to this payment policy when it was proposed in 2016. This year, over 60 Members of Congress requested that CMS reverse their biosimilar reimbursement policy. The current blended reimbursement policy deters innovation, and reduces the focus on patients and the quality of their care. NAMI Kansas strongly urges CMS to reverse this policy so that Kansans with mental illness may have access to the treatment they need.  The reversal of this policy is needed in part to properly incentivize the development of biosimilar products that will bring value to the treatment of mental illness.  <br/>",

    "text": "Dear Committee Members,<br/><br/> I am writing to as a rheumatologist to comment on the following:  <br/><br/>Medicare Program: Revisions to Payment Policies Under Physician Fee Schedule<br/>and Other Revisions to Part B for CY 2018; Medicare Shared Savings Program Requirements; and Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program<br/>(34) ULTRASOUND OF EXTREMITY (CPT CODES 76881 AND 76882)<br/>File code CMS-1676-6<br/><br/>I am a rheumatologist in private practice in New Jersey and use ultrasound in the care of my patients. <br/><br/>MY CONCERN:  <br/>Without any change in description of the services provided, the RUC recommends that the practice expense portion of the higher effort complete examination (76881) should be decreased and that of the limited exam (76882) increased so much that the limited examination will pay more than the complete examination. <br/><br/>The change in practice expense ratio appears to have been made to favor billing by a higher cost specialty that bills 78882 predominantly over the &quot;other dominant specialty&quot; who bills more 76881. (1)  The premise is that the higher cost specialty has a higher expense for producing the same product compared to other specialties, hence it should be paid more.  <br/><br/>THERE ARE SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS:  <br/>- If the financial interest of CMS is to obtain the best services at lowest cost, then changing the PE structure to pay more to the specialty who produces the same product at higher cost makes no business sense.  <br/>- The assumption that the higher cost specialty will bill 76882 for limited exams and other specialties will continue to bill for the lower reimbursement 76881, thus saving CMS expenses, is false.  76881, although representing a more thorough and time intensive exam to both perform and document, will reimburse lower than the 76882 limited examination.  It will therefore make business sense for everyone to bill 76882 regardless of the level of effort.  Additionally, a 76882 examination is much quicker to perform and document than 76881, creating even more incentive for higher numbers of 76882 billing.  <br/><br/>CMS HAS STARTED AN &quot;ULTRASOUND FIRST&quot; INITIATIVE THAT INCLUDES ULTRASOUND OF THE SHOULDER BEFORE MRI OF THE SHOULDER.  <br/>-This makes sense to save unnecessary imaging expenses, but the shoulder examination frequently requires a complete exam, for which the remuneration would be severely cut by the RUC recommendations.  Hence, CMS will be countering its own initiative if the RUC recommendations are followed, by disincentivizing use of ultrasound and encouraging otherwise the utilization of MRI.  <br/><br/>ANY GENERALIZATION THAT 76881 REQUIRES LESS EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT THAN 76882 IS FALSE.  <br/>ANY GENERALIZATION THAT THE PRACTICE EXPENSE RATIO FOR A COMPLETE EXAMINATION (76881) IS HIGHER THAN AN INCOMPLETE (76882) EXAMINATION IS FALSE.  <br/>-A longer examination time should translate to more room time, more equipment time and more resources needed for the examination, such as sheets, towels, paper towels and disinfectant.  It must follow that the technical component of a lengthier examination would be higher.  The fact that the members of the RUC did not come to this conclusion validates the flawed approach.<br/>- In of the practice of rheumatology, ultrasound imaging requires high frequency imaging equipment with quality Doppler signaling, and this cannot be performed by low-end inexpensive machines.  We utilize high end machines for complete examinations to answer questions that impact management decisions including decisions whether or not to use expensive biologic medications.<br/>- The same equipment is used for studies that require either complete or partial scanning, the only difference being the time of study and the extent of documentation.   <br/>- The decrease in advanced sonographer labor time advocated by the RUC for 76881 (was 35.0 min, decreased to now zero) is not generally true in rheumatology, as the vast majority of rheumatologists who bill for ultrasound obtain advanced training in musculoskeletal ultrasound and perform the studies themselves.  It is important for us to do it this way because we perform bedside dynamic study of the patient rather than just obtaining images.  <br/><br/>I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO REJECT THE RUC RECOMMENDATION FOR CHANGE IN PRACTICE EXPENSE RATIO CHANGES TO 76881 AND 76882.  The issues surrounding billing for these two codes are complex, because the codes cover so much heterogeneity in techniques and specialty use.  Any oversimplified solution based on a flawed premise is doomed to failure.  If RUC recommendations are followed, all you will see is an influx of 76882 billing and further confusion.  Instead, to address your concerns I recommend CMS convene a group representing ultrasonographers from all specialties using musculoskeletal ultrasound to suggest better descriptions of complete exams (perhaps by joint or extremity region), and a rational remuneration structure.  <br/>",

My concerns include the following:<br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The cost of having to pay the &quot;approved&quot; vendor.  Since ASCs have been doing patient satisfaction surveys for over 20 years, they are more than capable of handling this important aspect of patient care, themselves, and don&#39;t need to pay an extra $500- $900/ month for this service.  The cost associated with this program will most certainly be a hardship on the bottom line of most facilities<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The length of the survey.  Many of us feel that this lengthy questionnaire will be too long for many of the patients, and that only the patients with negative comments will take the time respond.  If fewer patients reply then the negative replies will impact what appears to be the center&#39;s satisfaction rate in a very negative way.  Right now I have a 60% return rate on our questionnaires with a 97% positive feedback rate; this rate would be greatly skewed with fewer patients replying as well as decrease our respect in the community.<br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Loss of personal touch.  For centers like mine, I know we will experience the loss of feeling in touch with the patient&#39;s concerns.   Patients look forward to hearing from us, personally and a random call from a &quot;stranger&quot; is invasive and impersonal.  Please consider allowing us to continue handling our patient satisfaction surveys in house, and we are more than willing to share all of our results/ statistics with CMS for your records. In addition, we are prepared with PSS results to present to every CMS surveyor as part of our required, now bi-annual inspections.  We recognize the need for transparency for the patients to be able to make a proper choice, but feel this will have the opposite effect.<br/>We have a very personal relationship with our patients, and we look forward to personal follow up after every procedure.

Please accept my concerns regarding the CMS proposed rule:  Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Systems and Quality Reporting Programs on behalf of Lutherville Surgicenter CY2018.<br/>We are concerned over a few issues regarding this proposal.  First, it would place a great financial burden on our center in providing, monitoring and paying approx. $5-7,000 yearly for an outside vendor to conduct the patient survey.   We are a small surgicenter center that strives to provide safe, efficient, affordable health care to our patients, with a limited budget.  <br/>Secondly, we conduct and review satisfaction surveys on a regular basis.  We take great pride in our patients satisfaction and the ability to deal with our patients directly so issues or areas of concern can be addressed quickly.  Patients receive enough calls from us during their operative phase, along with a written survey request. The majority of patients are very happy to have personal input into their experience. Our patients tend to be very honest and forthright. Furthermore, our surveys have been and continue to be available for CMS review at any time.   With this new proposal, patients will be receiving a call from an outside vendor who is not familiar with our center or them, who can not address their concerns and who will be taking a considerable amount of the patients time on the phone to meet a CMS regulation.  I question just how many patients would be willing to do this lengthy impersonal survey, especially if they feel they are getting nothing out of it.  <br/>Please reconsider this proposal.  Perhaps work through our organization such as ASCA to reconsider how best to meet the patients, Surgicenter and CMS needs in a more affordable, personable manner. <br/>Thank you very much for allowing me to comment on this. <br/>",

    "text": "In the proposed rule, you state- &quot;Patients with a relatively low anesthesia risk and without significant comorbidities who have family members at home who can assist them may likely be good candidates for an outpatient PHA or THA procedure. These patients may be determined to also be able to tolerate outpatient rehabilitation in either an outpatient facility or at home postsurgery.&quot;<br/> <br/>This statement opens a Pandora&#39;s box of ambiguity. The basis of the 2 MN rule is that patients must have an expectation of two midnights of medically necessary care in the hospital to be admitted as inpatient unless the surgery is on the inpatient only list.  If total joint replacement is taken off the inpatient only list, those surgeries must meet this two midnight standard to be admitted as inpatient. Yet your statement  suggests that a patient with comorbidities who does not have a good home support system can be admitted as inpatient for their total joint replacement, even if those comorbidities and the surgery do not lead the doctor to have an expectation of a two midnight medically necessary hospital stay. How is a doctor to determine the number and type and severity of comorbid conditions which warrant inpatient admission? Are we not back to the pre-two midnight rule situation where an very subjective assessment of risk was made, leading to a million RAC denials and the institution of the two midnight rule? You have added the &quot;physician judgment&quot; exception as of January 1, 2015 but that rule, as interpreted by the QIOs, applies to high severity patients such as acute MI, complete heart block and diabetic ketoacidosis and not to &quot;high risk&quot; chest pain or high risk TIA and therefore cannot possibly apply to &quot;high risk&quot; total joint replacement. If a patient&#39;s comorbid condition is uncontrolled, making them &quot;high risk,&quot; it is unlikely that the patient will be undergoing an elective surgery such as joint replacement so that standard cannot be used.   <br/> <br/>In addition, you cite the ability &quot;to tolerate outpatient rehabilitation in either an outpatient facility or at home postsurgery&quot; as a factor in that inpatient admission decision. Does that mean that a patient who is not expected to require two medically necessary midnights in the hospital but who is felt unable to tolerate anything but rehabilitation in a SNF setting can be admitted as inpatient and kept in the hospital for the required three days (even if no medical necessity for hospital care exists) in order to qualify for part A SNF coverage?    <br/> <br/>I am aware that you are proposing to forbid RAC audits for two years to allow hospitals to adopt practices but that is little consolation knowing that in two years the RACs will be able to easily deny any inpatient total joint replacement admitted as inpatient who stayed under two midnights and deny many of the patients whose stay was 3 days and was followed by a SNF admission. We need specific guidance on this and answers to the above questions.<br/><br/>",

Specifically, I write in strong support of CMS&#39; interest in expanding access to ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) for procedures like cardiac catheterization that fall outside of the current CPT surgical range of codes. <br/>As you know, Medicare regulations create a patchwork system of coverage rules for certain diagnostic and interventional cardiovascular (specifically endovascular) procedures. As it stands today, if a treatable cardiac condition is diagnosed in a Medicare patient at an ASC or a doctor&#39;s office, the physician generally cannot intervene immediately - even if doing so would be medically appropriate, safe, and/or common practice under other coverage options. In many cases, this means that Medicare patients must undergo the intake process, sedation, catheterization, and discharge on multiple occasions at multiple settings before they can be treated for their diagnosed condition. This can lead to situations that are potentially dangerous for patients&#39; health outcomes, not to mention financially and functionally burdensome.<br/>It has been my experience that patients receive more efficient and cost effective care in the outpatient setting.<br/>Medicare regulations have not kept pace with changes in state law that increasingly allow for these procedures to take place in stand-alone facilities. Furthermore, the current ASC covered procedures list, which considers primarily the procedures grouped in the CPT surgical range of codes, with some exceptions, does not reflect advancements in technology and updated clinical guidelines with respect to ASCs. Most importantly, the current definition of &quot;covered surgical procedure&quot; does not consider advancements in endovascular interventions like percutaneous coronary intervention, which enable us to treat cardiac conditions using minimally invasive techniques in sophisticated, stand-alone cardiac catheterization laboratories. This results in Medicare beneficiaries receiving care that is often more expensive - both for the Federal government and the patient - while being logistically burdensome and clinically disadvantaged. <br/>",

I am a surgeon practicing in the State of California.  I am writing to encourage you to remove total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) from the inpatient-only list, and also move these codes to the ASC-payable list.  <br/>Traditionally, these cases have been done as an inpatient with a hospital stay of up to several days and at a relatively high cost. Now, due to less invasive techniques, improved peri-operative anesthesia, alternative postoperative pain management and expedited rehabilitation protocols, these types of procedures are being done safely and effectively in outpatient facilities such as ASCs. <br/><br/>I personally have been providing outpatient surgical services in my community for approximately 15 years with excellent outcomes.  I have consistently advocated for Medicare beneficiaries to be able to receive outpatient surgery for many years since in our community these outpatient programs generate as good as or better outcomes and results in a faster recovery than a traditional inpatient joint replacement. This results in a much high value to my patients as measured by an optimum combination of outcomes, patient satisfaction and cost. Over my career my colleagues and I have witnessed many types of surgery including ENT, gynecology, general surgery, ophthalmology, urology and orthopedic that were once inpatient only procedure now routinely performed on an outpatient basis in the ASC. This has resulted in improved care to our patients. Moving TKA and THA into the ASC is a natural progression of this evolution.<br/><br/>Medicare, its beneficiaries and taxpayers are spending more money than necessary because these procedures are not reimbursed in lower-cost, highly-regulated settings such as ASCs. I strongly urge CMS to remove TKA and THA from the inpatient-only list and allow these codes on the ASC-payable list.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Jay A Johnson, MD, FACC<br/>",

    "text": "Dear CMS representative, <br/><br/>I am currently a medical oncologist in the state of Florida.<br/>I have personally seen the expansion and the abuse by 340b hospitals destroy my prior private practice, and as a result, patients lives.<br/><br/>Before moving to Florida, our private practice was forced to join a hospital program.  This hospital, through its enormous 340b profits, brought out all the primary care and specialists, and therefore, we lost our referral base.  I saw absolutely no evidence that they provided any indigent care.  If we had a cancer patient who was uninsured, we were told by the hospital that we could not treat them or see them in the clinic.  <br/><br/>This hospital profited from 340b in the most corrupt fashion.  Even with 340b drug discounts and unbelievable profit margins, they had the audacity to then charge all of our patient&#39;s excessive fees after they controlled the market.  I had patients who switched over from our private practice telling me that their copays doubled as a result of &quot;Hospital fees&quot;.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I believe the same thing is about to happen here in my current city in Florida.  A large hospital in my area with 340b drug pricing is planning on opening a cancer program just to take advantage and &quot;game&quot; the system.<br/><br/>I truly hope that this abuse of our health care system by hospitals comes to an end.  It hurts our patients, our health system, and only contributes to abuse and increased drug costs.  If a hospital truly wants to provide indigent care, then they should be held accountable, and demonstrate that every penny earned through 340b pricing is allocated directly to indigent care, and not to hospital execute bonuses.  <br/>",

    "text": "I am writing to express my strong support for Medicare&#39;s proposal to stop abuses of the 340B drug discount program. <br/><br/>Abuse of the 340B program by some hospitals is causing serious, unintended consequences for the nation&#39;s cancer patients and system. It is costing the government and patients much more for cancer care that could - and should - be delivered in local, affordable community oncology clinics.<br/><br/>Everyone agrees that 340B is a critically important safety-net program for uninsured, poor, or vulnerable patients. Unfortunately, the program has grown tremendously to include nearly half of all acute care hospitals in the United States. This is because some hospitals have figured out that they can profit off of 340B discounts without any oversight or accountability.<br/><br/>Without 340B reform, no one wins (except for some hospitals). Putting profits before patients is bad for those who truly need 340B discounts and people like me who rely on quality, affordable, and accessible local cancer care in their own community. This is particularly important for rural and underserved communities where there are few cancer care providers.<br/><br/>340B hospitals should be held to high standards of transparency and accountability, so that government and the public understand exactly how the discounts are being used. As it stands today, hospitals are not required to show how they are using 340B savings or even if they are directly lowering costs for patients. Instead hospitals can pocket the profits for use on executive bonuses, new buildings, and more. In addition to accountability, we need transparency and public reporting from all the 340B program participants.<br/><br/>With this in mind, I want you to know that I stand with Medicare and CMS as it reforms 340B so it works how it was originally intended. Everyone should support this effort to end hospital abuse of the program.<br/>",

    "text": "I am a veterinarian who frequently treats puppies recently shipped from breeding facilities. When I examine these puppies it is typical for me to find illnesses (both contagious and related to poor hygiene and/or neglect), behavioral issues indicative of poor husbandry and neglect, and evidence of poor vaccination practices. These puppies&#39; new owners are dismayed to find out that their puppies are ill and came from facilities that seem not to be maintaining appropriate AWA standards. I am beyond dismayed when I invariably find these puppies accompanied by USDA forms stating that these facilities are in compliance with USDA regulations. I see firsthand how merely rubber-stamping AWA license renewals leads to animal illness and poor animal welfare. I can&#39;t understand how the USDA can renew a facility&#39;s license without repeating an inspection or reviewing violations. What is the point of a renewal process that doesn&#39;t require facilities to display compliance? How can such a process ensure animal welfare? How can it assure the pet-buying public that they&#39;re not buying an ill animal or supporting a breeding facility that engages in abusive or neglectful practices?   The USDA&#39;s current practice of granting a license renewal without performing a new inspection or reviewing a licensee&#39;s violation history enables facilities to continue unlawful behavior, puts animals at risk, misleads the public, and makes a sham of the AWA. I urge APHIS to revise the license application and renewal process to ensure new standards for robust inspections and violation history reviews.<br/><br/>",
