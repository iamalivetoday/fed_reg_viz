As such, any cutbacks should therefore be subject to transparency BEFORE implementation, rather than at the discretion of the executive branch and captains of industry. The benefits of stringent environmental regulation policies are multifold, including rivers no longer bursting into flames, rivers and streams less polluted by industrial waste and agricultural runoff, cleaner air in our major cities, and clean drinking water. Those benefits do not come with a &quot;cost benefit&quot; price tag, but every citizen benefits. Cutting back the EPA could be a disaster waiting to happen. Just look at Flint, Michigan. 3 YEARS after the public learned how contaminated their water system is, and there still are no alternatives for all those families in place.

    "text": "Dear EPA Regulatory Reform Task Force members:<br/><br/>Please convey the following three points to Administrator Scott Pruitt.<br/><br/>1. EPA regulation of clean air is both effective and desired by a majority of the American people. We do not have significant problems with acid rain anymore because of EPA regulation of sulfur dioxide. We used to have a big, growing hole in the ozone layer, until the EPA regulated certain aerosols. The EPA can and must do the same with greenhouse gas emissions. According to research from Jon Krosnick at Stanford Public Opinion on Climate Change, a majority of Americans support government regulation on this issue and are willing to pay more for goods in exchange for a sustainable environment. This research is consistently confirmed in polls by The Washington Post/ABC News, Duke University, Quinnipiac, and Gallup, to name just a few.<br/><br/>2. A small number of big polluters with deep pockets may be opposed to regulation, but trade associations representing over 60,000 small business owners (of which I am one) are vocally opposing efforts to curb greenhouse gas regulations. Many in the business community see how thoughtful, necessary regulation spurs innovation and research, generating jobs and profits and positioning US companies to be more competitive in the global marketplace. http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/global_warming_litigation/clean_air_act/pdfs/American_Business_for_Clean_Energy_2010.pdf<br/><br/>3. Individual liberty is at stake. The states that generate the most pollution also pollute states around them and contribute to global warming for everyone. Big companies that pollute the air and water do the same. Both resist reasonable regulation because they want, in essence, a handout. That is, they want to profit while passing off the costs of dealing with environmental pollution to their neighbors and to the rest of the inhabitants of the planet. <br/><br/>As a taxpayer, an involved, conscientious citizen, a business owner, and a human being who needs to breathe clean air in a stable climate -- and as a parent who wants the same for my children and their children -- I am asking you to communicate to the Administrator of the EPA that I do not want a repeal or relaxation of existing regulations. Instead, I want thoughtful, vigorous enforcement of current EPA regulations and intelligent, well-informed implementation of new regulations that are needed to slow the course of climate change. Greed and denial must not be allowed to bring us to ruin. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Kelly Priest",

Therefore, labels will need to include the same amount of grams of sugar under each category e.g. &quot;17 grams of Total Sugar&quot; and &quot;17 grams of Added Sugars.&quot; This will confuse food consumers.<br/><br/>If this label is implemented at the commercial beekeeping level it will begin the misinformation to food consumers that sugar is added to honey. Eventually, it will create confusion across the honey industry and mislead the consumer about a natural product.<br/><br/>As stated in 21 US Code 342 (b)(4), &quot;A food shall be deemed to be adulterated... if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to...make it appear better or of greater value than it is.&quot;<br/><br/>If consumers are informed through the Nutrition Facts label that honey contains &quot;Added Sugars&quot; then consumers may be led to believe that honey is adulterated, by the regulatory definition, with sugars added to develop or enhance its sweetness.<br/><br/>I realize that honey is added to foods in preparation or manufacturing and in that case it is clearly an added sugar in those foods and would therefore be labeled as &quot;Added Sugars&quot; on the Nutrition Facts label. However, pure honey, itself, does not contain added sugars.<br/><br/>I share the desire for clear, understandable nutrition information to aid consumer choice and promote public health without confusion or misbranding around pure honey.<br/>As a beekeeper I encourage the FDA to consider listing the naturally occurring sugar content of 100% pure honey as a &quot;Total Sugar&quot; and not &quot;Added Sugars.&quot;",

As organic foods and products have become more popular, producers have obtained significant benefits from increased demand.  However, this increase in demand for organic products has created new incentives for irresponsible and dishonest producers to cut corners in the production process.  It is essential that the organic integrity of industry products is protected through reasonable and measured regulation.  These changes also protects honest producers from corrupt competitors that would tarnish the industry&#39;s reputation for their own short term benefits. When shown the difference between true-organic and nonorganic products, consumers immediately realize the health and happiness benefits they provide. Consumers have come to expect high quality organic products and we must protect that standard.  <br/><br/>My note of caution to the industry would be to ensure that input from producers in constantly measured.  The industry should work hand-in-hand with regulators to protect the integrity of organic products.  Despite the good will that should exist between the industry and regulators, it is essential that the USDA recognize the need for flexibility.  Regulation of industries across our economy is often slow to change and frequently fails to keep up with changing dynamics.  This cannot be the case with the organic market.   USDA should implement systems to monitor and proactively adapt to the industry needs and demands. This process should be transparent with input from stakeholders at every step.   After all, these systems are being adopted to protect honest producers. <br/><br/>With that, I commend the work of USDA and industry partners in their joint efforts to protect organic.  Thank you. ",

    "docAbstract": "EPA is proposing to add natural gas processing (NGP) facilities (also known as natural gas liquid extraction facilities) to the scope of the industrial sectors covered by the reporting requirements of section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) commonly known as the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (PPA), 42 U.S.C. section 13106. Adding these facilities would meaningfully increase the information available to the public on releases and other waste management of listed chemicals from the natural gas processing sector and further the purposes of section 313 of EPCRA. EPA estimates that at least 282 NGP facilities in the United States would meet the TRI employee threshold (10 full-time employees or equivalent) and manufacture, process, or otherwise use (threshold activities) at least one TRI-listed chemical in excess of applicable threshold quantities. NGP facilities in the U.S. manufacture, process, or otherwise use more than 21 different TRI-listed chemicals, including n-hexane, hydrogen sulfide, toluene, benzene, xylene, and methanol. EPA expects that TRI reporting by United States NGP facilities would provide significant release and waste management data on these chemicals to the public."

Therefore, labels will need to include the same amount of grams of sugar under each category e.g. &quot;17 grams of Total Sugar&quot; and &quot;17 grams of Added Sugars.&quot;<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Not only is this confusing for consumers, it is also incorrect.

    "text": "Dear FDA,<br/><br/>As a consumer, I am concerned about the new legislation proposed for nutrition labels as it pertains to pure, jarred honey.  I have read that adding the line, &quot;added sugars,&quot; to the labeling requirements is intended to differentiate between healthy and &quot;empty&quot; calories, and I agree that this is a good thing to communicate.  If this was the differentiation that I as a consumer would see, I would be 100% for it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the label information, as currently written, does not communicate this.  It communicates to the consumer that the beekeeping and honey industry is adding sugars to our honey, when in fact it is a pure and whole food that has not been altered in any way.  As there have been numerous accounts recently of adulterated honey entering the US market, and selling adulterated honey is illegal, forcing beekeepers to say that they have added sugars to their honey (making it adulterated), when they have not, will be bad for both consumers and beekeepers.  The end result will be further confusion from the nutrition label, rather than clarification.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.",
