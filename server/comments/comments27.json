The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people. The whole point of having national standards is to ensure decent basic standards for all workers. The updated overtime standard is already linked to the lowest-wage Census region. Workers rights and wages should not be undercut even further by weakening the salary threshold.<br/><br/>canan tzelil<br/>canant@hotmail.com<br/>-<br/>beverly hills, California 90210",

The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people. The whole point of having national standards is to ensure decent basic standards for all workers. The updated overtime standard is already linked to the lowest-wage Census region.

Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe.

    "text": "As a scientist, I cannot make it more clear: our Marine National Monuments and National Marine Sanctuaries are critical for scientific research. These sites serve as important research locations that are relatively untouched by human activities. The species found there are unique and likely not found in other parts of the world (and there is a large amount of undiscovered biodiversity which has not yet been studied at all of these sites). Furthermore, basic research in marine ecosystems has led to many discoveries which ultimately benefit human medicine and biomedical science: this includes new classes of drugs and antibiotics which have been discovered from scientific bioprospecting studies carried out in marine sites such as those under review.nThe importance of US marine monuments and sanctuaries cannot be understated.<br/><br/>The scientific community is deeply concerned about the review of six National Marine Sanctuaries and five Marine<br/>National Monuments, and we urge protection for the existing boundaries in recognition of their scientific, cultural and historical significance.",

They are an indispensable economic driver for coastal and ocean communities, generating $8 billion annually through commercial fishing, tourism, and recreation activities within protected areas. By restoring fisheries, protecting against the dangers of offshore oil drilling, and providing a buffer against climate change, marine sanctuaries are critical to the entire nations economy, health, and security. <br/><br/>Since President Nixon established the National Marine Sanctuary Program, bipartisan support from communities, Congress, and presidents has been critical to designate and expand marine sanctuaries. An attack on any marine sanctuary is an attack on the very fabric of American democracy. Please stand with the communities who advocated for marine protections and the people who support national marine sanctuaries and monuments.    ",

    "text": "Dear Secretary Ross:  I strongly urge you to uphold the designations made by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

    "text": "Dear Wilbur Ross,<br/><br/>The country&#39;s marine national monuments and sanctuaries, home to a tremendous diversity and richness of ocean life, are of significant scientific, historic, and cultural value. Designated under the Antiquities Act, these National Monuments and sanctuaries constitute the first generation of blue parks bestowed on our nation.<br/> <br/>An attempt to roll back protections in order to allow energy and mineral exploration or commercial fishing in any one of these monuments and sanctuaries imperils our country&#39;s cultural and scientific legacy and natural heritage. We strongly urge you to maintain the current protections for all marine national monuments and sanctuaries. <br/><br/>Our diverse U.S. marine monuments and sanctuaries protect a rich array of ocean species and their habitats, including deep sea ecosystems considered to support some of the rarest and unique ecological communities in the world. These habitats in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts are home to sperm whales, Atlantic puffins, and lush deep sea coral gardens, including one of the planet&#39;s oldest organisms, black corals. Other species may contain chemical compounds of biomedical importance. The Pacific monuments protect hundreds of seamounts (underwater mountains), which are hotspots of biodiversity, and places like the Marianas Trench are home to hydrothermal vents, active volcanoes, and the deepest trench on the planet. These sensitive ecosystems are some of the least explored in the world.  Maintaining these monuments and sanctuaries&#39; boundaries allows for the continued discovery of new deep sea species in addition to providing nursery and spawning habitats for commercially valuable fish while also protecting thousands of threatened species.  <br/><br/>I am confident that your review pursuant to President Trump&#39;s Executive Order will find that each marine national monument and sanctuary was established with broad public support and adequate consultation with Federal, State, and tribal governments.  <br/><br/>I write to add my voice and show the strong public desire that monuments and sanctuaries not be altered or eliminated, and that the U.S. maintain all of the current protections for these diverse marine ecosystems. These unique places benefit all Americans, including future generations. <br/><br/>I urge you to support the following list of marine national monuments and sanctuaries and recommend the boundaries and protections remain as they are today.

    "text": "Dear Secretary Ross:  I strongly urge you to uphold the designations made by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

    "text": "Alexander Acosta,<br/><br/>Overtime pay was a hard fought battle.  Workers deserve overtime, when they work overtime.  There have already been unacceptable manipulations of overtime calculations. <br/><br/>The attempt to return workers to a condition for forced servitude, without fair compensation is also an attempt to return the country to 19th c. conditions.  With that, comes the next step of required overtime (the workers cannot say no, but must work on order).  The conditions which then prevail include a complete lack of health and safety both for workers and those who fall within the work done--hospitals, public transport and construction are excellent examples.<br/><br/>This will mean ill, injured and dead workers and ill, injured and dead members of the public.<br/><br/>All to increase the obscene profit already being made by corporations.<br/><br/>Concerned about work and pay issues?  Start with the ratio between what CEOs and their lobbyists are earning, compared to the people actually doing the work.<br/><br/>And remember, unfair wages are always connected to unfair--and dangerous--working conditions.<br/><br/>Back in 1975, President Gerald Fords Labor Department set the salary level for overtime exemption at the equivalent of about $58,000 in todays dollarshigh enough to cover more than 50 percent of full-time salaried workers.

Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.

    "text": "I am horrified by the continuing attacks mounted against some of our nations greatest treasures  protected marine sanctuaries and monuments. <br/><br/>From the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument to the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, marine sanctuaries and monuments protect 600,000 square miles of underwater parks. They are an indispensable economic driver for coastal and ocean communities, generating $8 billion annually through commercial fishing, tourism, and recreation activities within protected areas. By restoring fisheries, protecting against the dangers of offshore oil drilling, and providing a buffer against climate change, marine sanctuaries are critical to the entire nations economy, health, and security. <br/><br/>Since President Nixon established the National Marine Sanctuary Program, bipartisan support from communities, Congress, and presidents has been critical to designate and expand marine sanctuaries. An attack on any marine sanctuary is an attack on the very fabric of American democracy. Please stand with the communities who advocated for marine protections and the people who support national marine sanctuaries and monuments.    ",

Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

    "text": "Dear Secretary Ross:  I strongly urge you to uphold the designations made by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

    "text": "Dear Secretary Ross:  I strongly urge you to uphold the designations made by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America&#39;s economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

The Monterey bay aquarium provides a space for children and adults to learn about conservation and wildlife. If you remove space from Monterey bay national marine sanctuary you would deprive hundreds of thousands of children and adults from learning how to preserve and respect wildlife. Furthermore without the space, Monterey bay aquariim cannot research the many many species that live in the ocean environment you&#39;re considering taking away. Finally and most importantly the space you&#39;re considering to take away is home to multiple species of animals. By removing the natural habitats you will be killing animal species and increasing the likelihood for endangerment. Please reconsider. I visited the Monterey bay aquarium last year and it completely inspired me to take a harder stance for ocean wildlife. It is vital that we speak up and act before it is too late. ",

Designated under the Antiquities Act, these National Monuments and sanctuaries constitute the first generation of blue parks bestowed on our nation.<br/> <br/>An attempt to roll back protections in order to allow energy and mineral exploration or commercial fishing in any one of these monuments and sanctuaries imperils our country&#39;s cultural and scientific legacy and natural heritage. We strongly urge you to maintain the current protections for all marine national monuments and sanctuaries. <br/><br/>Our diverse U.S. marine monuments and sanctuaries protect a rich array of ocean species and their habitats, including deep sea ecosystems considered to support some of the rarest and unique ecological communities in the world. These habitats in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts are home to sperm whales, Atlantic puffins, and lush deep sea coral gardens, including one of the planet&#39;s oldest organisms, black corals. Other species may contain chemical compounds of biomedical importance. The Pacific monuments protect hundreds of seamounts (underwater mountains), which are hotspots of biodiversity, and places like the Marianas Trench are home to hydrothermal vents, active volcanoes, and the deepest trench on the planet. These sensitive ecosystems are some of the least explored in the world.  Maintaining these monuments and sanctuaries&#39; boundaries allows for the continued discovery of new deep sea species in addition to providing nursery and spawning habitats for commercially valuable fish while also protecting thousands of threatened species.  <br/><br/>I am confident that your review pursuant to President Trump&#39;s Executive Order will find that each marine national monument and sanctuary was established with broad public support and adequate consultation with Federal, State, and tribal governments.  <br/><br/>I write to add my voice and show the strong public desire that monuments and sanctuaries not be altered or eliminated, and that the U.S. maintain all of the current protections for these diverse marine ecosystems. These unique places benefit all Americans, including future generations. <br/><br/>I urge you to support the following list of marine national monuments and sanctuaries and recommend the boundaries and protections remain as they are today.

    "text": "I am a small-business owner, operating 16 BURGER KING restaurants that employ 435 individuals in the United States. I am writing today to request that you amend the Final Rule, titled &quot;Food Labeling; Nutrition Labeling of Standard Menu Items in Restaurants and Similar Retail Food Establishment&quot; (&quot;Rule&quot;), issued on Dec. 1, 2014, to provide for more flexible options for restaurateurs across the country. <br/> <br/>As currently written, the Rule requires that caloric information be displayed on the menus and menu boards next to the name or price of the item. The calories must be posted in a type face that is the size of either the name or the price, whichever is smaller, and must be in the same color &quot;or at least as conspicuous&quot; as the name used for the item. Other information, including total calories, total fat, calories from fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, fiber, sugars and protein, must be provided in written form upon consumer request and noted as such on menus and menu boards.<br/><br/>This Rule creates a one-standard-fits-all model that does not take into consideration the unique nature of the restaurant business, including the hundreds of combinations of food items that impact the nutritional data. It also does not allow for a quick service restaurant owner like me to cure even minor violations (a number falling off a drive-thru menu, for example) without facing criminal and civil penalties. Furthermore, while the rule includes an exemption for operations with fewer than 20 locations, the exemption does not apply to franchisees like me who operate an independent business.<br/><br/>I ask that you reconsider the Rule to allow for more flexible posting alternatives. For example, allowing restaurant owners to place information on one listing designated as the &quot;menu&quot; or &quot;menu board&quot; will lessen posting errors, as well as the burden on employers like me. Additionally, allowing for flexibility in determining which serving sizes are appropriate to be used (single servings, entire product or common unit of division) will limit errors while providing identical information to the consumer. I also ask that you remove the requirement that each restaurant location have an employee certify that every food item adheres to the nutrient values as determined by the corporate entity. As a small-business owner, I have neither the time nor the resources to ensure that these qualifications are met. Finally, inserting a 90-day &quot;cure period&quot; for those who act in good faith and are non-compliant due to inadvertent human error would allow small-business owners like me to focus on running my business and growing jobs rather than living in fear of a violation.  <br/><br/>Thank you for delaying implementation of this Rule so that FDA and others can fully analyze its impact on small-business owners across the country. I appreciate you considering my suggestions and am happy to provide further input as requested.",

    "text": "As a public health professional, I oppose any delay or weakening of the menu labeling regulations and recommend that the compliance date extension to May 7, 2018 be revoked. This extension published in the Federal Register on May 4, 2017 is contrary to the public interest and unnecessarily delays menu labeling implementation more than seven years after passage of the law. <br/><br/>Preventable risk factors such as physical inactivity and poor diet have contributed to the obesity epidemic over time. Local health departments work with a wide range of community partners to create conditions and policies that help people make healthy choices, such as avoiding tobacco use and eating healthier foods. <br/><br/>Delaying the implementation of menu labeling denies Americans the ability to make their own informed choices about how many calories to eat at a time of high rates of nutrition-related health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, which add significant fiscal and public health burdens on the American public, businesses, and federal, state, and local budgets. <br/><br/>Covered establishments have already invested the resources for compliance with the rule as finalized and have had ample time to comply, with additional time provided by both the FDA and Congress.<br/><br/>Studies show that providing nutrition information at restaurants can help people make lower-calorie choices and encourage restaurants to provide healthier offerings. According to the Food and Drug Administration&#39;s (FDA) regulatory impact analysis, the estimated benefit of menu labeling is $9.2 billion over 20 years: the total cost is $1.2 billion, providing a total savings of $8 billion over 20 years. A Harvard University study found restaurant menu labeling could prevent up to 41,000 cases of childhood obesity and could save over $4.6 billion in healthcare costs over ten years.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Given that the menu labeling final rule was stayed a day before the compliance date, all chain restaurants, supermarkets, convenience stores, and other food service establishments would have had to already have their prepared foods and menu items analyzed, their menus redesigned and updated, and staff trained. Delaying the compliance date is unlikely to result in any cost savings for them. In fact, if the requirements of the regulations are changed, it is likely that chains will incur additional costs. <br/><br/>Many national restaurant chains have labeled for years under state and local menu labeling laws beginning nine years ago with the implementation of the first two menu labeling laws in New York City and Seattle/King County, Washington with leadership from the local health departments in those cities. Food establishments have demonstrated that labeling is feasible in a reasonable space and at a reasonable cost without liability risks. A national poll found that 80% of Americans support calorie labeling at chain supermarkets, the same level of support as for restaurant labeling.<br/><br/>When drafting the menu labeling statute, Congress, advocates, and the restaurant industry all strongly agreed that menu labeling should be broadly applied to all establishments that sell food for immediate consumption. The FDA addressed concerns about covered establishments in the final regulations, taking into account different business practices and operations, including doing business under the same name and offering for sale substantially the same menu items, and carefully considered industry concerns expressed during the comment period. <br/><br/>Under the final rule, calorie information must be posted clearly and conspicuously for self-service foods and foods on display so that customers can use the calorie information at the point of selection.  Posting calories in a location that is not visible to people as they are making food selections would significantly weaken menu labeling, limiting access to and the usefulness of calorie information for consumers. The FDA has already provided considerable flexibility for labeling foods on display. According to the FDA&#39;s final guidance, there are several options for the placement of calories for foods on display. <br/><br/>It is essential for calories to be listed for each item as offered for sale. Without standardization, people will have difficulty using the nutrition information for menu items. Posting the total calories per menu item enables consumers to more easily compare different types of food items and determine how many people will share the item. <br/><br/>In order to protect the public&#39;s health, I strongly urge the FDA to revoke the compliance date extension and move forward with implementing the menu labeling regulations as finalized. Americans need calorie labeling to make informed choices. The final menu labeling regulations provide well-defined nutrition labeling requirements that are applied in a fair manner to all covered establishments and would provide accessible calorie labeling to allow consumers to make their own choices.",

    "text": "I&#39;m flummoxed at how long this has already been delayed. This measure was passed in 2010. It is now 2017! For seven years, this measure has languished in the pipeline. Menu labeling is a simple educational measure that gives consumers the information they need to make healthier choices for themselves and their families. I can&#39;t think of any logical reason to delay this any further unless there is an intent by the administration to kill it altogether on behalf of industry.<br/><br/>I live in NYS where six counties and NYC have menu labeling laws. I&#39;ve NEVER heard of a single hardship or financial loss from a restaurant because they had to implement menu labeling. No chain restaurant has closed in financial ruin due to menu labeling. No pizza restaurant has shut down because they had to put calories on the menu boards or menus. No grocery store that had to label take out food went out of business due to the measure.<br/><br/>I know that some restaurant or food chains have claimed they have massive expenses creating new menu boards YEARLY due to menu labeling. That&#39;s an outright lie. A restaurant only needs to change its menu board and menus one time to include calories. Anything beyond that is an expense the chain incurs of its own free will.<br/><br/>I know that some restaurants have argued over portion size. This is not brain surgery. People eat a whole muffin or a full slice of pizza. Use common sense where industry is fighting over portion sizes. Don&#39;t let industry hide the real calorie counts by allowing them to give figures for portions that are unrealistic. <br/><br/>Menu labeling is a HUGE help for people who want to know the number of calories in the food they are ordering. It has already made our restaurant food healthier thanks to reformulation of menu items with embarrassingly high calorie counts. Any delay of this measure is purely political in nature and has nothing to do with reality. The reality is, menu labeling is a ONE TIME expense for restaurants (who change menus and menu boards regularly anyway!) that empowers consumers. <br/><br/>Please do not delay this measure any longer at the expense of America&#39;s health and our right to know about our food!<br/><br/>",
