I do not know why a war is being waged on working people, but this proposal is truly indicative of that.  Waiting tables is an entry level way for people to develop social skills and customer service, without being condemned to a minimum (And oftentimes not livable) wage.  Until the day servers are paid proper living wages through their employers, tips are the only way for servers to survive.  This has been an American precedent.  I would hope that any changes to legally affect servers in the future will be ones in their favor, not ones that will rob and demean them.<br/><br/>I object to this rule.

    "text": "I am opposed to this proposed amendment. I am aware that the wages of the back-room staff of restaurants and bars such as cooks and dishwashers are often inadequate, but the same is true for the waiters and bartenders who directly receive tips. All staff of restaurants and bars are under stress to get their jobs done when there are lots of customers, but only the waiters and bartenders receiving the tips are directly dealing with the customers giving the tips. The waiters and bartenders need a suite of social skills to do this not required of the backroom staff, who need to deal only with their co-workers. The waiters and bartenders should retain their tips in full as compensation for the deployment of these extra social skills. (I know that the least challenging customers are the ones apt to give the biggest tips, but this is an unfair paradox beyond your ability to resolve.) <br/><br/>I am also distressed to read that &quot;Labor Dept.

    "text": "I have been trucking accident free for 14 years.   The last 5 as an owner operator.  I installed an eld in my truck on December 18 as the mandate required. I must say I&#39;ve never been so exhausted in my life.  No longer can I work and sleep when my body tells me. I&#39;m forced to work tired and try to sleep when I&#39;m wide awake because a little box tells me that&#39;s safe?   That&#39;s insane.  I grew up an a small dairy farm.  I&#39;ve never in my life slept for 8 hours straight. And I&#39;m healthy as an ox at 35.  5-6 hours is all I need and I&#39;m wide awake.  So I have to set around and twiddle my thumbs for 4-5 hours before I can start my day.  And that&#39;s suppose to be safe?   Seriously?   By that point, I&#39;m ready for a nap.  But that little box says I can go to work now and the brokers, shippers, and receivers are expecting such. I admit. I do like to catch a little nap mid day.  Usually after a heavy lunch or shower.   But now with eld I really can&#39;t as it will cut into my available time.  So I&#39;m first to continue driving tired until my 14 is up.  Then pray I can find a spot to park (yes that&#39;s a serious problem that needs addressed too!!) with facilities, food, and showers.  Then do my business grab a meal and shower, catch my 5-6 hours of sleep.  Then set there and twiddle my thumbs for 3-4 hours before I can start it all over again.  Yes I could watch tv. Or go take in a movie, museum, or some scenery.  But this isn&#39;t a vacation for me.  It&#39;s a job.   I&#39;m out here to work and make money to provide for my family.  Yes I have 3 boys at home.  That I see even less now on eld.  I&#39;d rather go out on the truck, work, make some money, then go home and spend time with family.  We can save up and go on trips to museums together.  I don&#39;t need a babysitter in the form of a little box telling when I should be awake and when I should be asleep.  My body tells me that and I listen to it.   As I said before I&#39;ve been doing this for 14 years without an accident.  Not even so much as a fender bender.   I attribute that to luck mostly.  I&#39;ve seen some cars do a lot of crazy things.  A few trucks too. But the vast majority are cars.   Forcing me to drive through rush hour and snow, ice, and rain storms because I&#39;ve got available hours. Rather than stopping to wait it out is not safe!   I&#39;ve never been so scared in a truck for my safety and health as I have this past January. Grant this exemption to owner operators if this mandate is in fact about safety and not just about the revenue you hope to generate from it.  Because I guarantee it&#39;s a lot safer when trucks drive while they&#39;re awake and sleep when they&#39;re tired rather than doing so because some little mandated box told them to do so.  Take that time to address the HOS and parking issues.  And if you can come up with a solution to those I&#39;m pretty sure most owner operators will gladly comply with this mandate.  ",

    "text": "<br/>I am in Risk Management in the Trucking Industry, my husband is also an Owner Operator. I care not only about my husbands safety, but every driver who not only works for the company, but every driver on the highways. In my Risk Management position, I have seen many of these Certified Elog systems failing completely or having issues. The company I work for also went with a certified company and cannot seem to get responses to our questions as they are too buried in issues with these new ELDS. That alone shows that the ELD mandate was and is in no way ready to be enforced. <br/><br/>Secondly, in my position, we as a company, always kept tabs on our drivers and their logs. I did not see abuse, nor did I fear for their safety. We have very safe drivers who have been with the company for years and have years of experience. Now, it seems many companies are all turning up their trucks to be able to go faster due to the ELD mandate. I ask myself...How the hell is this safe? Or how about all the drivers running out of time on the side of the highways? This may not be happening to our drivers, but its happening to many out on the roads...there is no parking for these drivers. SO WHAT IS THE SOLUTION? The FMCSA needs to figure one out! <br/><br/>How about drivers still getting kicked off of Shippers and Receivers property...regardless when the driver states they are out of time because the shipper/receiver kept them there for 5 hours! What is being enforced or done to these shippers or receivers??? THE ANSWER IS NOTHING<br/><br/>Finally, as said, my husband owns his truck, if, for some reason, his safety is ever jeopardized due this ELD being hooked to the engine of the truck WHICH HE EARNED AND OWNS and his safety is compromised due to his truck being electronically shut down by a hacker, etc. (and hey, lets face it, the FMCSA WAS JUST HACKED) then I know for certain I will be holding the FMCSA accountable for this happening without a doubt!!! <br/><br/>We need to worry more about educating the regular motor vehicles out there rather then just putting more and more regulations on a driver. I myself try to get in the Semi at least once a year...and, to be honest, I hate every moment of it...you have cars going right in front of semi with no regard to their safety for the driver who is trying to make a living pulling his load. The FMCSA needs to start pouring more money into educating the public on what a semi driver can and cannot do...THEY CANT STOP ON A DIME! They cant simply get off the highways...BECAUSE,,,WE NEED EVERY DRIVER THIS COUNTRY HAS RIGHT NOW. There is a shortage and look at your driver count now...that shortage is getting bigger. WHY??? Because drivers are tired of being over regulated. <br/><br/>My stance on this ELD is not so drivers can run illegal...my stance is I have looked at these big companies that have had ELD&#39;s and the reason they started using them had NOTHING...I REPEAT NOTHING...to do with safety...but was merely a way to control costs and not have to hire so many people to audit logs and keep control as the smaller companies can do it was more for administrative reasons than safety. <br/><br/>Its not hard to calculate the numbers and see that the bigger companies with their elds have caused more accidents, killed and injured more people than any of the smaller companies do. I have personally been in the truck and watched the ELD drivers of these big companies SPEED THRU CONSTRUCTION ZONES...trying to beat that clock!!!! THATS SAFE???? <br/><br/>You see, a small company does not just put a warm body behind the wheel as the bigger companies do, the small companies look out for safety and look to employ those experienced drivers whom have good safety records. NOW THAT IS WHAT SAFETY IS ABOUT!<br/><br/>I see the trucking news daily...I cringe when I see these big companies in accident after accident...I will stand by my words...I would rather my family be on the highways with a non-ELD company driver next to them...then a big eld company untrained accident prone driver beside them ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. The reason being...I WANT MY FAMILY TO REACH HOME SAFE!",

We livestock owners know when we need to stop, or to let horses out to walk around, etc. This would create unnecessary hardship and expense. Please do NOT pass; ",

Additionally I feel there is NO money savings for the small fleets and 1 truck owner operators, maybe the big fleets will save money somewhere in the office as far as record keeping, but not the small guys. Also I fully support Ooida&#39;s request for an exemption from the ELD mandate, for the little guys that were doing just fine and keeping a good safety record just let them be, WHY TRY AND FIX WHAT ISN&#39;T BROKEN!!!!!!",

    "text": "The most corrupt administration in US history tries to legalize robbery from hard-working Americans!<br/><br/>The Department of Labor is considering a rule that would allow employers to confiscate workers&#39; tips.  It could be wait staff, <br/>bartenders, delivery people, bellhops, concierges, valets, parking attendants, you name it.  This is legalized robbery and we <br/>will not stand for it.<br/><br/>I call upon the Department of Labor to please withdraw it.  This rule would cause tipped workers to lose billions of dollars in <br/>wages annually.  It must be immediately withdrawn.<br/><br/>As incredible as this Department of Labor proposal is, it gets worse.  Earlier today, a Washington, D.C. news outlet broke the <br/>story that Department officials covered up an analysis that the rule would transfer billions of dollars from workers to their <br/>employers.<br/><br/>According to a study done by the Economic Policy Institute, tipped workers would lose an estimated $5.8 billion annually if this <br/>proposal become law-and women would bear the brunt of this loss, losing as much as $4.6 billion.  That&#39;s because most tipped <br/>workers are women-and a disproportionate number are women of color.<br/><br/>And it is not as if these workers make a lot of money to begin with.  If you look at restaurant workers, for example, the median <br/>monthly income for wait staff and bartenders is only $867.  And a study conducted by the National Employment Law Project <br/>found that tips account for about 58.5 percent of wait staff&#39;s earnings and 54 percent of bartenders&#39; earnings.<br/><br/>Tips belong to workers, period.  When customers tip, they assume in good faith that the people who serve them will reap the <br/>benefits-not restaurant owners, managers, or investors.",

    "label": "",
    "docketId": "NOAA-NMFS-2017-0149",
    "docAbstract": "The rule would change the current greater amberjack recreational fishing year from January 1 - December 31 to August 1 - July 31.  The revised fishing year would improve fishermen\u2019s access to greater amberjack and provide an opportunity to harvest this species when other targeted reef fish species are prohibited from harvest.  A fishing year beginning August 1 would also reduce the likelihood of an in-season quota closure and would allow for harvest in the fall and spring.   The rule would also change the greater amberjack recreational fixed closed season from January 1 - June 30 to January 1 - April 30, June 1 - July 31, and November 1 - December 31.  The revised fixed closed season would protect the stock during peak spawning (March and April), while still allowing for a spring fishing season in May, and provide the opportunity for fishermen to target greater amberjack in the fall from August through October.  Continued protection to spawning fish would be expected to promote stock recovery."

Now when I say diversity, it is not in the way bureaucrats think of diversity. In my business we occasionally drive over the road, locally and regionally. My business also revolves around road construction and maintenance as well as oil field construction. We haul everything from our own hay, to lumber, to oilfield pipe and supplies, in addition to our own construction equipment. I am not diversified by choice. I am diversified by necessity. Owner operators are faced with a number of unbalanced requirements compared to Corporate owned, teamster run trucking companies. Small operators do not have the ability to forward contract fuel requirements weeks or months in advance. Small operators do not receive insurance discounts for having one or two trucks. Many, if not the majority, of owner operators perform much of their own maintenance, but we do not receive a discount on parts. We are, however, held to the same safety standards for drivers and equipment as multi-national companies. We, as owner/operators, can successfully boast a better safety record than the big Corporations.

If you do not acquire a provider for this service by using the government approved service by the deadline date, you may be fined or imprisoned. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Now see if this rings a bell? The government mandates that you will be required to use a government approved service for the purpose of acquiring a government approved provider, however you will be required to guarantee that the provider you choose, meets the government standard. The provider is not required to guarantee you anything and all liability lies with you. You may use the provider you previously used prior to this mandate, provided that the provider you previously used is approved by the government and listed on the government approved service. If you do not acquire a provider for this service by using the government approved service by the deadline date, you may be fined or imprisoned. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>These examples sound the same but are quite different. The first is for the Affordable Care Act (obamacare). The second is the FMCSA&#39;s Electronic Logging Device. The Affordable Care Act was ruled on by the US Supreme Court to be a tax. Please explain how the ELD mandate is more than another tax without representation. I was never consulted by anyone or asked to vote on another tax. Isn&#39;t the Unified Carrier Registration, 2290 Heavy Use Tax, State and Federal Operating Authorities, International Fuel Tax Agreement, Over weight/over width permits enough? <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Today I read an article of an owner/operator who overheard a conversation between another driver and a DOT officer. The owner/operator was driving a truck, exempt from the ELD mandate due to age. The other driver was a company driver. The company driver apparently had a HOS violation a few days ago in where he could not find a place to park for the night. That driver was put out of service. The owner/operator and his older truck were sent to the inspection shed. This story demonstrates not only the lack of common sense by the officer, but the lack of awareness and judgement by the ELD computer and the the discrimination the officer showed to the owner/operator of the older truck. If its old, it must have SOMETHING wrong with it, right? I have experienced this as well running a 2006 and 1988 truck together. The &#39;88 has been inspected many more times that the &#39;06 due to its age. Now if we&#39;re to accept the fact that DOT officers can use their OWN judgement when making these decisions, why are we not afforded the same consideration in decision making? <br/>Kurt Arnusch<br/>Lost Creek Transport",
