Too many school and other shootings have occurred without any part of out  government doing anything but sending  their condolences and saying  they were sorry for the victims and their families. Now is the time to start the process by supporting this bill and then going on to support any of the next steps like stronger gun regulations, elimination of semi- automatic weapons that should only be used for military purposes, and other measures. The people of this country are in support of these initiatives and those people like you and the Congress and the President should be supporting the will of the people. We need everyone&#39;s cooperation on this important issue now. Do not wait for another incident to occur.",

In November 2017, NMFS implemented an emergency rule that set the 2017 commercial and recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for red snapper in the South Atlantic at 42,510 fish.  Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.  The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

In November 2017, NMFS implemented an emergency rule that set the 2017 commercial and recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for red snapper in the South Atlantic at 42,510 fish.  Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.  The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

    "docAbstract": "NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 43.  In November 2017, NMFS implemented an emergency rule that set the 2017 commercial and recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for red snapper in the South Atlantic at 42,510 fish.  Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.  The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

    "docAbstract": "NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 43.  In November 2017, NMFS implemented an emergency rule that set the 2017 commercial and recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for red snapper in the South Atlantic at 42,510 fish.  Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.  The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

We no longer need personal firearms in our civilian possession... they are useless anyways against a government so well endowed with such aforementioned armed services that are armed with such hardware and armament of war that no other technologically advanced civilization would care to entertain the actual thought of war with said government.. <br/>Now that it is established in my argument that firearms should be banned in the United States of America as a civilian possession. I will argue that every fire arm  that is retained and possessed by the aforementioned citizen of the aforementioned civilized and law abiding government. since there is no current practical application other than murder; these firearms that are in civilian possession are stored in wait of murder... in wait or want; thats semantics.. we shall not argue semantics.. but we shall argue validity of firearms in civilian possession.. and the arguments to  parts and pieces to firearms shall no longer apply to a banned firearms... and hunting is not a valid reason to own firearms.. a man can hunt with a bow and arrow as well as rocks and sling... no need to use firearms..

More concerning is that manufacturers of bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons, which are the prime cause of such high death tolls at these shootings, are virtually unregulated and unlimited in the nature of weapon they want to sell. <br/><br/>Weapons and accessories like bump stocks are built expressly to circumvent the restrictions in the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the National Firearms Act of 1934. They allow individuals to modify a semiautomatic rifle in such a manner that it operates with a high rate of fire like a fully automatic rifle. There is no defensible reason why responsible hunters and home defenders need weapons that can destroy dozens of human beings in seconds. <br/><br/>In the absence of immediate action by Congress, I urge ATF to finalize its proposed rule clarifying that bump fire stocks, along with other &quot;conversion devices&quot; that enable semiautomatic weapons to mimic automatic fire, qualify as &quot;machine guns&quot; under the National Firearms Act. And then Congress must act, too, to ensure that manufacturers cannot endanger public safety by designing weapon accessories that imitate machine guns. They are openly subverting the law. These dangerous devices put all citizens at risk, especially the most vulnerable--children, and people who decide to remain gun-free. The NRA would tell us that everyone has the right to own whatever gun they please, but what about the rights of the rest of us to attend church, schools, concerts, and public events without being gunned down?

Prior to the recent emergency action, the ACL was zero and harvest was not allowed since 2014.  The actions in Amendment 43 will remove the process and equation used to determine the red snapper ACL as specified in Amendment 28 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP.  In addition, this action will specify a total ACL equal to 42,510 fish, a commercial ACL equal to 124,815 pounds (whole weight), and a recreational ACL equal to 29,656 fish to allow harvest of red snapper beginning in 2018.   The action is expected  to reduce, to the extent practicable, existing adverse socio-economic impacts to fishermen and fishing communities that utilize the red snapper portion of the snapper-grouper fishery, without overfishing, and while continuing to rebuild the stock as per the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act."

The science is clear: human-driven climate change is real, and it is caused largely by carbon emissions. The Clean Power Plan is an important step toward cutting those emissions and limiting the damage they are already causing. Without measures like the Clean Power Plan, we will continue to spew ever more carbon and other pollutants into the atmosphere, leading to more loss of glaciers, land erosion, dried-up water sources, and mass extinction of animal and plant species. Furthermore, we must wean ourselves off finite carbon-based energy sources and focus on changing over to renewable sources. For the sake of the future of our country and our planet, we must keep these laws on the books. ",

    "docAbstract": "The EPA is taking action to repeal the Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units (EGUs), commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan, as promulgated October 23, 2015. The EPA is also proposing the Affordable Clean Energy rule which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE rule would replace the 2015 Clean Power Plan, which EPA has proposed to repeal because it exceeded EPA's authority."

    "text": "Repealing emission guidelines for any pollution source in 2018 is absurd to the point of satire, but that power generation plants are the target of Pruitt&#39;s latest deregulatory obsession is alarming and infuriating.  The EPA was founded to protect our environment so that rivers stop catching fire and babies stop dying from breathing the open air; if Scott Pruitt wishes to completely fly in the face of this purpose with his obsequious posturing for the benefit of fossil fuel corporations, then he is kindly invited to climb into his office&#39;s soundproof booth so someone can lock it from the outside.  To the good people still at the EPA, this country remains both proud and appreciative of the work you do, even with a deranged cabbage in an ill-fitting suit giving you these kinds of nauseating marching orders.<br/><br/>Please retain the carbon pollution emission guidelines as is.  They&#39;ll never be made more restrictive by a man like Pruitt, but the least we can do is try to hold position until the ghouls in charge of American politics are removed from power.",

This is especially problematic when clean energy sources are readily available, with the investment of workforce training, time, &amp; money. ",
