    "text": "Food and Drug Administration HHS,<br/><br/>Please consider my public comments with regard to the potential inclusion of cannabidiol (CBD) in the World Health Organizations international drug scheduling code.<br/><br/>I oppose the imposition of additional international restrictions limiting either its use or access. Cannabidiol lacks the sort of abuse potential and mood-altering activities to warrant such action by WHO. Seventeen US states explicitly recognize by state CBD as a therapeutic agent. Safety trials, such as those publicly available here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22716148 and here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22129319 here and here have determined the substance to be non-toxic and well-tolerated in human subjects. Even the head of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, Dr. Nora Volkow, has publically acknowledged in an op-ed here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nora-volkow/cannabidiol_b_7834066.html that CBD is a safe drug with no addictive effects.<br/><br/>Recent clinical trials have reported that CBD administration can safely and effectively mitigate epileptic seizure frequency, reduce blood pressure, improve the quality of life in patients with Parkinsons disease, mitigate anxiety, and potentially reduce certain drug cravings. However, the substance is unlikely to reach its full therapeutic potential if WHO imposes unnecessary and arbitrary restrictions upon its access or use. For these reasons, I ask the FDA to not recommend that WHO take any further action to either schedule or restrict CBD under international codes. Cannabidiol is not presently scheduled under existing UN treaties and it should remain that way.<br/><br/>Kaitlyn Wilson<br/>kaitlyn333wilson@gmail.com<br/>3015 parkview ave<br/>Cincinnati, Ohio 45213",

As a retired physician -- forty years after medical school -- I advise that the<br/>FDA ban ALL drug advertising. The educational value of drug advertising is<br/>poor. It drives consumer interest in directions that are not useful to the patient<br/>and the physician and directs consumer interest toward drugs that by-and-large<br/>are new and therefore obscenely expensive. <br/><br/>2. If prescription drug advertising is allowed to continue, the only real educational<br/>value would be to inform listeners/patients that there is treatment for health<br/>issues such as HIV, Hep C, or whatever. The utility of ads for constipation or<br/>diarrhea or bad breath is debatable and  pollutes the airways.<br/><br/>3. The current litany of side effects vomited forth on current drug advertisements <br/>is ridiculous.

    "text": "<br/><br/>I am writing in response  to the Department of Justice inviting public comment into regulations or released guidance that, among other things could inhibit job creation or growth developments.  I urge you to look at the following regulations:<br/><br/>1. The DOJ must take a serious look and eliminate/redraft the 2011 statement of DOJ on enforcement of the Integration mandate of title II of the ADA and Olmstead v. L.C.  As it is written now, it takes away choice, where an individual wants to live, work and whom you choose to spend your time with.  The right to choose is  the civil right of every U.S. citizen, including those with disabilities.  An individual has the right to choose the employment setting that best fits their needs.  Those options should be a full array of service options including a Community Rehabilitation Programs (CRP&#39;s) or &quot;Sheltered Workshop&quot;.  Please look at the definition of segregation and how this impedes choice.  Informed choice is always best, but segregation is not segregation if a person willfully chooses.<br/><br/>2.  The 2016 DOJ statement also inaccurately depicts the center-based employment and also fails to  acknowledge the rights of the individuals that have chosen this employment setting.  Individuals and their families choose employment settings that best meets their needs.  The DOJ needs to eliminate the statement and assist the Dept. of Ed. and RSA to stop the narrow interpretation of &quot;competitive integrated employment&quot; that is leading to job loss and is against the individual with a disabilities rights.  <br/><br/>3.  Eliminate the October 31, 2016 statement of DOJ on application mandate of Title II.  This statement can be interpreted differently from state VR offices and can prevent referals to an Abilityone contract.  Abilityone contracts offer high-paying, high quality jobs and are excellent employment opportunities for some .<br/><br/>4. We ask that you recognize  Community Rehabilitation Programs  as a viable option of employment for individuals with disabilities.  For many years CRP&#39;s have provided quality opportunities for individuals with disabilities and are as much a part of the COMMUNITY as any other place of employment.  Individuals perform real work and engage in meaningful, productive employment.  Please rewrite the statement to emphasize and recognize that it is each persons civil right to choose the employment setting that best fits their individual needs.  We need to expanded opportunities for these individuals, vs. taking employment opportunities away.  One size does not fit all.  Here are a couple of  stories from individuals and their families that benefit from a Community Rehabilitation Programs:<br/><br/>George is a delightful, fun-loving, 29 yr. old who has a physical and mental disabilities due to lack of development to the brain.  He is legally blind, cannot stand or walk independently, lacks fine motor skills and has limited use of his hands, communication is difficult for him. His parents tells us that the reason they chose a CRP or &quot;Sheltered Workshop&quot; is because it provides him with an opportunity to develop his social skills, work skills  and gives him a routine to provide him with emotional and mental stability.  &quot;Not having a full day of work and activities would mean that George would have more time at home with nothing to do except watch t.v.&quot; ........ &quot;Lastly, I am of the understanding that America is still the land of the Free.  Everyone is free to make choices about their life, where they want to live, work, etc,  The disabled community and their families or caregivers need to be given that same right to decide where they want to work, what works best for them.  If you were to ask George if he likes where he works he would resounding say Yes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It is very important to have a  facility that provides services for people with disabilities.  This allows those with disabilities a place to go everyday and work.  People always feel better about themselves when they have a purpose.  It keeps people off the streets and they learn skills while earning a paycheck. &quot; <br/><br/>Betty, is a 20 yr. old individual with Autism.  Betty required continuous supports from school to her work transition program.  By having the opportunity to have a CRP as part of her school to work transition program, she is much more independent and thriving.<br/><br/>  ",

Box 8013<br/>Baltimore, MD 21244-1850<br/><br/>Re:  CMS-1678-P - Medicare Program:  Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) Program<br/><br/>Dear Administrator Verma:<br/><br/>As a practicing academic and clinical vascular surgeon at IU Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana, I am writing regarding the proposed decrease in Medicare reimbursement for complete vascular ultrasound examinations. I am also director of the hospital non-invasive Vascular Laboratory and am quite familiar with the work involved in preforming such studies. <br/><br/>In the Proposed OPPS Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) Group Policies under Radiology and Imaging Procedure Services, it is disheartening to note the severe decrease in proposed reimbursement for complete vascular ultrasound services from $223 to $149.  By virtue of this proposal, a complete vascular ultrasound services would be reimbursed at the same rates as limited vascular ultrasound services in the same APC. The lower reimbursement for complete ultrasound services grossly undervalues and underpays hospitals for the resources needed to perform these procedures to our patients.  This reimbursement as you know includes the appropriate equipment and technologist&#39;s time and effort required to provide this service.  The dedicated rooms, supplies (gowns, acoustic gels, gloves, etc.), advanced duplex machines, trained and experienced technologists, and accreditation processes that the hospital outpatient department provides ensures an accurate and precise study.  The precision of the study is critical to understanding the complex vascular pathology our patients&#39; have and based upon which I must help them make therapeutic decisions both medically and invasive.  The time required to conduct a complete study greatly exceeds that of a limited study and is mandated in the most complex cases, which adds even more dedicated time and effort. In addition to these concerns, it is already very difficult to find, hire and retain certified vascular ultrasound sonographers to work at our hospital.  Like many professionals in the medical field, these dedicated people are becoming more challenging to find due the aging of the profession (the average age of a practicing vascular ultrasound sonographer is increasing) and the need to be compensated at a level that will allow supporting a growing family and its inherent commitments. The restructuring of these imaging APCs without regard for the dramatic reduction in reimbursement of the complete ultrasound procedures threaten our hospital&#39;s capacity to provide these services to our Medicare patients who are so in need. <br/><br/>In addition, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2006 is still in effect, with OPPS payments being used to replace the fee schedule payments for the technical component of imaging services.  While this legislation no longer affects most imaging procedures, these proposed payment reductions will have grave consequences for community-based vascular ultrasound labs with the overall impact being in the millions of dollars for just one year. From a personal perspective, the overall effect may be the inability to continue providing these studies, either completely or at a severely reduced and unacceptable level, to care for the complex patients often referred from other vascular surgeons who consider the patient too complex to manage locally. Patient access for the sickest of sick Medicare patient will be in jeopardy. <br/><br/>I would ask CMS to halt any reductions in Medicare reimbursements for vascular ultrasound procedures for CY 2018 in the hospital outpatient department fee schedules.  The proposed reduction of close to $75 for complete vascular ultrasound exams is not acceptable and will have grave consequence for vascular ultrasound services at all sites of service. <br/><br/>Sincerely,   <br/><br/>Michael C. Dalsing, MD<br/><br/>Michael C.

L.C. to State and Local Government&#39;s Employment Service Systems for Individuals with Disabilities (2016 DOJ Statement).  This 2016 DOJ Statement can be read to support state Vocational Rehabilitation Offices to refusing to refer people with disabilities to high-paying, high-quality jobs that fall under AbilityOne or state set-aside contracts just because those contracts are intended to hire people with disabilities.  <br/><br/>Right now, 19 state Vocational Rehabilitation Offices are refusing to refer jobs.  If contracts cannot be fulfilled because of staffing shortages - which is happening right now - the nonprofit agency (NPA) holding the contract could lose the contract, costing not just the jobs of the people with disabilities who might have been employed absent the job-killing federal policies that were implemented by the last administration, but also the jobs of all the people currently working for the NPA.<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that the EMPLOYMENT rate of people with disabilities is 17.9%, as compared to the 65.3% employment rate for people without a disability.  There are good jobs available for people with disabilities and there are people with disabilities who want to work.  But they are not being matched up because of the wrong-headed federal policies that are reflected in this 2016 DOJ Statement.  The government needs to get behind programs that will increase employment opportunities, not take them away under the idea that a mythical community exists where all people no matter how significant the disability will be able to work in high-quality, high-paying jobs, and where peers and co-workers will be available to help them with their personal and professional needs.  There is no such community.  But jobs falling under AbilityOne and state use programs, are jobs that allow people with disabilities to become taxpayers.  These jobs are all over the country - in government buildings, in airports, on military bases, in call centers, in the United States congressional office buildings - to call these jobs &quot;segregated&quot; or not &quot;in the community&quot; is not just wrong, it means people with disabilities are being treated differently from all other government contractors - to their detriment.  This cannot continue.<br/><br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>This 2016 DOJ Statement also inaccurately portrays center-based employment and fails to recognize the right of all individuals to choose the employment setting that best meets their individual needs.  The Department of Justice must eliminate the 2016 DOJ Statement and assist the Department of Education and the Rehabilitation Services Administration in getting rid of the narrow interpretation of competitive integrated employment that is leading to such job loss and the massive derogation of the rights of people with disabilities. <br/><br/>For the reasons above Chimes urgently recommends the DOJ must revisit and eliminate or redraft the 2011 Statement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Olmstead v. L.C. (2011 DOJ Statement).  Presently, it does not embrace the significant right to individual choice that the Supreme Court recognized in Olmstead.  We ask that the Department rewrite this 2011 DOJ Statement to emphasize the right of each individual with disabilities who is eligible for services to choose the employment setting that best fits their needs.   <br/><br/>We also ask the Department to recognize in any redrafted Statement that community rehabilitation providers (CRP) have been dedicated for more than five decades to helping people with disabilities work.  CRPs are often the lifeblood of their communities; often the biggest employers.  They are in cities and towns all over America.  For the past five years, the federal government has attempted to scape-goat community rehabilitation providers as being not a part of the community and claiming they run segregated work centers.  These NPAs and the people who have quietly worked for the benefit of people with disabilities for more than half a century - that were the community-based solution to getting people out of institutions and helping them work and live full and vibrant lives - deserve to be treated better.  In the redraft of the 2011 DOJ Statement, the government should embrace the expertise and depth of understanding of the community rehabilitation providers and recognize the important role they play in helping people with disabilities become and  stay employed, and expand their opportunities.<br/>",

Specifically, I write in strong support of CMS&#39; interest in expanding access to ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) for procedures like cardiac catheterization that fall outside of the current CPT surgical range of codes. <br/>As you know, Medicare regulations create a patchwork system of coverage rules for certain diagnostic and interventional cardiovascular (specifically endovascular) procedures. As it stands today, if a treatable cardiac condition is diagnosed in a Medicare patient at an ASC or a doctor&#39;s office, the physician generally cannot intervene immediately - even if doing so would be medically appropriate, safe, and/or common practice under other coverage options. In many cases, this means that Medicare patients must undergo the intake process, sedation, catheterization, and discharge on multiple occasions at multiple settings before they can be treated for their diagnosed condition. This can lead to situations that are potentially dangerous for patients&#39; health outcomes, not to mention financially and functionally burdensome.<br/>Medicare regulations have not kept pace with changes in state law that increasingly allow for these procedures to take place in stand-alone facilities. Furthermore, the current ASC covered procedures list, which considers primarily the procedures grouped in the CPT surgical range of codes, with some exceptions, does not reflect advancements in technology and updated clinical guidelines with respect to ASCs. Most importantly, the current definition of &quot;covered surgical procedure&quot; does not consider advancements in endovascular interventions like percutaneous coronary intervention, which enable us to treat cardiac conditions using minimally invasive techniques in sophisticated, stand-alone cardiac catheterization laboratories. This results in Medicare beneficiaries receiving care that is often more expensive - both for the Federal government and the patient - while being logistically burdensome and clinically disadvantaged. <br/>In light of these considerations, I fully support the proposal to modernize Medicare coverage and payment rules for cardiovascular procedures in the ASC setting, which would bring the program more up to date with commercial payers, technological advancements, and clinical guidelines. <br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>Kim Kinler<br/>1106 Alston Ave, STE 100<br/>Fort Worth, TX 76104<br/>",

    "text": "Now only 6 out of 1995 comments are from anybody who is educated on animal welfare. Please read ALL the requirements of a USDA breeder before making uneducated comments. As I did read these comments, most seem to be cut and pasted from animal rights activists instead of from informed public. As I read, the repeated words abused, violations, &quot;puppy mills&quot;, (something on an elephant) and a lot of &quot;rubber stamping&quot; it became very clear that 1989 people are sadly misinformed about current USDA requirements.<br/> How many of you fully understand the true meaning of these terms? Society is giving the same merit to an expired tube of Neosporin &quot;violation&quot; as an actual demised animal from starvation. They are not the same thing. One is an &quot;oversite&quot; and the other is animal cruelty. USDA needs to spend time on defining neglect and cruelty. <br/>The term &quot;puppy mill&quot; is now associated with USDA breeders. This derogatory term has no legal definition; is only a fabricated term invented by animal rights and its only purpose is to promote hate and prejudice towards breeders. Yet USDA is failing to protect and defend its licensees (and inspectors). I am thankful that the &quot;public&quot; list of holders was pulled as maybe USDA will see the relentless ignorant public its licensees faced on a daily basis. USDA should also give a definition to &quot;puppy mill&quot; as only an opinion of an unlicensed breeding facility without a credible entity. <br/>Without an educational tool, graded ratings for its upstanding licensees, we all are thrown in the same bucket of disgrace. As society is being told so much misinformation about &quot;puppy mills&quot; with visuals from unlicensed and unregulated entities, being told that this is what USDA facilities do. Yet when USDA sets silently back and does not discredit these lies, the public now believes the lies as no truth is given to show otherwise.<br/>USDA needs to focus on a &quot;violations&quot; merit system, similar to what is used at a restaurant. As the public does not appear to understand that there is an annual unannounced inspection of USDA facilities, the way USDA worded your request for information inferred that there are no further inspections past the initial license. This lack of communication, as USDA is visually seeing, just promotes &quot;hate&quot; upon the industry. <br/>USDA must do a better job of defining the line between animal rights and animal welfare, as the 2 things are not the same. Those 1989 commentators clearly believe they are the same. My dogs do not get in a car, drive to work, and return with a pay check. They would kill each other and starve to death if I personally did not provide for them. Therefore it is up to ME to provide for them. The only RIGHTS they have is that they are &quot;entitled&quot; to proper welfare. The problem is that this &quot;vision&quot; of what this means has been grossly distorted to its meaning. I have attached an additional &quot;publication&quot; that helps with that.<br/>I am a USDA breeder, the public thinks it knows what it wants, but doesn&#39;t understand that is what is currently being done. USDA must take time to explain and visually demonstrate it.<br/>",

    "text": "I am a medical oncologist and have seen firsthand the impact of 340B abuses on patient access to affordable high quality <br/>cancer care.  The 340B drug discount program is a critically important safety-net program that gives clinics or hospitals <br/>that are supposed to care for high numbers of uninsured, poor, or vulnerable patients, discounts on drugs they buy for<br/> these patients. There are two hospital systems in this city and they both purchase chemotherapy using the 340B program. <br/>In addition to running the hospitals, they have developed large health networks and employ the majority of the physicians <br/>and oncologists. Their leverage over insurance companies has allowed them to negotiate an astronomically high <br/>reimbursement rate for the delivery of chemotherapy drugs.  Examples taken from EOB&#39;s from real patients the local<br/> area were published by the local newspaper.  One vial of a generic chemotherapy drug irinotecan, for example, costs $60.  <br/> The hospital will purchase this drug at a considerable discount based on 340B pricing.  The amount collected from the <br/>insurance company by the hospital system for the delivery this vial to the patient is $4500.  A more expensive brand name <br/>drug rituximab costs $6333 per vial.  The hospital also buys this drugs at a considerable discount based on 340B and then<br/> collects $19,000 from the insurance company.  Physician owned practices in our area do not purchase their drugs with <br/>340B pricing and have much lower insurance contracted reimbursement for the delivery of chemotherapy to patients.  <br/>Multiple studies have proven that the cost of cancer is much lower when provided by physician owned practices.1  <br/>The combination of 340B discount pricing and highly profitable insurance contracting have given hospital based cancer <br/>programs an unfair financial advantage over physician owned practices.  In addition, hospital administrators will admonish<br/> their employed primary care and specialists physicians for referring out of network.  Due to the  lower profit margin and the <br/>drop off in referrals, many of the physician owned oncology practices in this city began to struggle and eventually were sold<br/> to one of the two hospital systems.  As each hospital system has grown, they have begun the process of expanding<br/> their cancer centers.  One hospital system built a cancer center in 2012 and is now adding on an expansion. <br/> They continue to hire more oncologists and have offices in multiple locations in multiple states.  The other hospital system <br/>has hired 10 oncologists over the last 3 years and also have announced plans to build a new cancer center.  <br/>The abuse of the 340B system has led to increased hospital profits, more physicians employed by hospital networks, <br/>and fewer choices for the patient. All of this at a much higher cost, which is ultimately borne by the patients and their families.  <br/>I support the CMS proposal to reform the 340B program so that hospital abuses are stopped and we can ensure the<br/> program helps patients in need.<br/><br/>1 Cost Drivers of Cancer Care: A Retrospective Analysis of Medicare and Commercially<br/>Insured Population Claim Data 2004-2014  Milliman and Community Oncology Alliance April 2016<br/><br/>",

Since ASCs have been doing patient satisfaction surveys for over 20 years, they are more than capable of handling this important aspect of patient care, themselves, and don&#39;t need to pay an extra $500- $900/ month for this service.  The cost associated with this program will most certainly be a hardship on the bottom line of most facilities, and unlike most businesses, a surgery center cannot pass the increased cost of doing business along to its customers because we get a facility fee and nothing more.<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The length of the survey.  Many of us feel that this lengthy questionnaire will be too long for many of the patients, and that only the patients with negative comments will take the time respond.  If fewer patients reply then the negative replies will impact what appears to be the center&#39;s satisfaction rate in a very negative way.  For example if a center has a 60% return rate on their questionnaires with a 97% positive feedback rate; this rate would be greatly skewed with fewer patients replying as well as decrease the level of  respect in the community.<br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Loss of personal touch.  We believe that with the 3rd party vendor survey, we will experience the loss of feeling in touch with the patient&#39;s concerns.   Patients look forward to hearing from us, personally rather than a random call from a &quot;stranger&quot; which is invasive and impersonal.  Please consider allowing us to continue handling our patient satisfaction surveys in house, and we are more than willing to share all of our results/ statistics with CMS for your records. In addition, we are prepared with PSS results to present to every CMS surveyor as part of our required, now bi-annual inspections.  We recognize the need for transparency for the patients to be able to make a proper choice, but feel this will have the opposite effect.  <br/><br/>We have a very personal relationship with our patients, and we look forward to personal follow up after every procedure.

    "text": "<br/>Dear Secretary Price:<br/><br/>The California Orthopaedic Association represents over 2,000 orthopaedic<br/>surgeons practicing in California, many of whom treat Medicare patients. <br/><br/>Summary of our comments.<br/>1. Support removing total knee replacements (TKRs) from the inpatient only list<br/>allowing them to be performed and reimbursed in an HOPD.<br/>2. Support adding TKRs to the ASC covered surgical procedure list to allow TKRs to<br/>be performed and reimbursed in an ASC setting.<br/>3. Support also removing total hip replacements (THRs) from the inpatient only<br/>list allowing them to be performed in an HOPD.<br/>4. Support adding THRs to the ASC covered surgical procedure list to allow THRs<br/>to be performed and reimbursed in an ASC setting.<br/>5. Support allowing other total joint replacement procedures, (e.g., shoulder,<br/>wrist, and ankle) to be removed from the inpatient only list and performed and<br/>reimbursed in an ASC setting.<br/><br/>Total joint replacements have become a common procedure for Medicare patients with <br/>very reliable and predictable outcomes. For properly selected patients, these and other <br/>procedures are routinely and safely performed in the ASC setting.<br/><br/>There are many benefits for Medicare beneficiaries in having the procedure<br/>performed in an ASC setting - lower infection rates, specialized nursing staff,<br/>surgeon involvement in the management of the ASC, and a more patient-friendly<br/>surgical environment. ASCs receive high patient satisfaction scores.<br/><br/>Total joint procedures are also beneficial for Medicare beneficiaries. Following<br/>total joint replacement surgery, beneficiaries can continue to live a more active<br/>lifestyle which results in a healthier senior population with fewer health care needs. <br/>Their increased mobility allows them to live independentl longer and reduce long-term care costs.<br/><br/>ASCs provide an efficient practice setting for surgeons. We believe that the surgeons&#39;<br/>involvement leads to improved outcomes.<br/><br/>Allowing total joint replacements to be performed in an ASC setting creates a win win<br/>situation for patients, Medicare itself, and surgeons from a quality and cost<br/>standpoint.<br/><br/>The proposed rules seek input in 5 areas:<br/>1. Are most outpatient departments equipped to provide TKA/THA to Medicare<br/>beneficiaries? Speaking on behalf of ASCs, yes ASCs are well-equipped to<br/>perform total joint replacements in an out-patient setting - ASC setting. Many<br/>ASCs are managed with the active involvement of the surgeon. This helps<br/>ensure well-trained staff specializing in musculoskeletal procedures.<br/>2. Can the simplest procedure described by the family of total joint replacement<br/>codes be performed in most outpatient departments? Yes. The most<br/>important factor, for any total joint replacement procedure is patient selection.<br/>Each individual patient is evaluated regarding their overall health and readiness<br/>for the procedure.<br/>3. Is the procedure sufficiently related to codes that CMS may have already<br/>removed from the inpatient only list? The primary surgical risks of any total<br/>joint replacement procedure are the same - blood loss, infection, and pain<br/>control. ASCs are well-equipped to manage these risks. In fact, ASCs have<br/>lower infection rates than inpatient stays.<br/>4. How often are total joint replacements being performed in an ASC setting?<br/>We are seeing more group health and Workers&#39; Compensation carriers move in<br/>the direction of allowing total joint replacement procedures to be performed in<br/>an ASC setting. They are finding that these procedures can safely be<br/>performed in the ASC setting at a significantly lower cost.<br/>5. Can these procedures be safely performed in an out-patient setting? Yes,<br/>ASCs routinely receive high evaluations for patient safety, low infection rates,<br/>and appropriate tools to manage post-surgical pain.<br/>In addition, while the HOPD presents a savings for the Medicare system, an ASC<br/>setting would result in even higher potential savings for the system without<br/>jeopardizing patient safety.<br/><br/>In 2014, more than 400,000 Medicare beneficiaries received a hip/knee<br/>replacement, costing the government more than $7 billion for the<br/>hospitalization alone. These costs are unsustainable. <br/><br/>CMS must follow other payors in looking for more safe and cost-effective settings<br/>for these procedures to be performed.<br/><br/>Moving total joint replacement procedures to an out-patient setting (HOPD or<br/>ASC) presents a huge potential savings for the Medicare program. Research from<br/>the University of Berkeley found ASCs saved the Medicare program and its<br/>beneficiaries $7.5 billion from 2008-2011. This same study projects an<br/>additional savings of $7.6 billion over the next 10 years. This is without even<br/>considering the potential savings of total joint replacement procedures being<br/>performed in an outpatient setting.<br/><br/>We strongly urge CMS to allow TKR, THR and other total joint replacement<br/>procedures to be performed and reimbursed in an ASC setting.<br/><br/>Basil Besh, M.D.<br/>President",

    "text": "RE: Notice-MK-2017-03<br/><br/>Election integrity can be verified only when the relevant election data are disclosed and displayed in a meaningful format for analysis and decision making. Clearly, there are some privacy-related constraints about election data disclosure. Nevertheless, there exist statistical methods for detecting and displaying the most suspicious subsets of election results, which may become the focus of deeper investigation. <br/><br/>I have been doing extensive quantitative research on the topic, and I believe that the Election Integrity Commission may be interested in my methodology, which I described in my attached pending patent and on my website: http://www.electionoutliers.com. My area of specialization is quantitative finance, and I applied my skills to the election domain this time.<br/><br/>Let me just summarize the purpose of the patent, methodology, and the website, as it is described on this website:<br/><br/>Are you interested in election results in general? Do you want to know about anomalies in these results? For example, some precincts in a state may have extreme deviations of their election results from multiple meaningful benchmarks. A few counties may contain clusters of such abnormal precincts with unexplained election outlier results. One of the election choices may have unusually higher percentage of such outlier precincts than other election choices, and these suspicious precincts may alter the statewide ranking among election choices.<br/><br/>This website contains some highlights of the election outliers patented analysis (see United States Patent Application Publication No. 2016-0267490 &quot;System and Method for Detecting Non-Negligible Election Fraud&quot; in PDF or HTML formats) that identifies the most suspicious election choice, the degree of suspicion, counties with clusters of unusual results, and a small subset of precincts that may require the highest priority audit. The impact of these precincts on the statewide ranking among election choices is shown as well. The methodology may be used for certifying the election results for different granularities of disclosed election-related data. The entire analysis is completely unbiased to any election choice, county, or precinct.<br/><br/>I believe that my methodology must be applied to all elections results, which must be disclosed and visualized for the public in the proposed format.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>James Johnson<br/><br/>",

I strongly encourage CMS to assign each biosimilar a unique HCPCS code instead of all biosimilars sharing a code for billing and payment in context of the 2018 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule final rule. <br/><br/> Although we appreciate CMS&#39;s strategy to streamline billing time for physicians and other practitioners, we believe that streamlining coding for biosimilars would not be in the best interest of Medicare beneficiaries.   The availability of the biosimilars might not be available and/or the reduced costs would not be passed on to patients because of the disincentives to prescribers to take advantage of these new technologies of there is a single billing Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code.  We urge CMS to develop HCPCS codes for each biosimilar that is approved to adequately meet the needs of patients.<br/><br/>Finally, when the existing rule was finalized there was only one biosimilar on the market. Today there are five with dozens more in the development pipeline. Given the negative impacts blended rates could have on doctor&#39;s offices and patient choice, continuing with an outdated rule simply does not make sense.  <br/><br/>The good news for seniors with serious conditions like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn&#39;s disease and psoriasis is that cheaper and better treatments are on the way.  Changing the biosimilar Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HDPCS) to reflect the promise of new treatments is not only good policy, but will foster the development of those treatments. <br/><br/>To allow physicians and patients access to the newest biosimilar treatments at a reduced cost, the Colorado Gerontological Society respectfully requests CMS to reverse their biosimilar reimbursement policy. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/> <br/> EILEEN DOHERTY, M.S.<br/> Executive Director<br/>",

Far from being burdensome, current civil rights rules and regulations  benefit schools and students by providing a clear framework that, when followed, allow all students an equal opportunity to learn in a safe and welcoming environment regardless of sex, race, color, national origin, disability status, English proficiency, sexual orientation, or gender identity.<br/>I urge the Department to keep in its current form 34 C.F.R. pts. 1 thru 1299 , which include regulations governing the Secretary and the offices for Civil Rights; Elementary and Secondary Education; Special Education and Rehabilitative Services; Career, Technical, and Adult Education; Post-Secondary Education; Educational Research and Improvement; and the National Council on Disability. <br/><br/>I also urge the Department to preserve all current significant guidance documents, including guidance on sexual, racial, and disability-based harassment (including guidance on sexual violence); access to athletic opportunities; gender equity in career and technical education; single-sex schools; equal access to educational resources; nondiscriminatory school discipline; racial diversity programs; the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools; restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities; and the rights of English language learners. I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place, and to continue enforcing these critical civil rights laws so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Tony Holland<br/>  Dallas, TX 75244",

The animals continue to suffer as a result. The agency&#39;s paltry fines lack the necessary deterrent effect on chronic animal abusers.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and willingness to fix this problem to stop this animal suffering as soon as possible.

    "text": "this is regarding CBD<br/><br/>CBD has been extremely helpful for me, my family, and my friends.  It&#39;s pain relief properties are incredible.  It works fantastically for MS and for epilepsy.  Since there&#39;s not many studies on it (and who would pay for them anyhow as one cannot patent it) I have given it to as many friends &amp; family as possible, and the results have been quasi-miraculous.  That sounds hyperbolic but I assure you it&#39;s the truth.  I wish I could get them all to comment for this, but that&#39;s going to be an uphill battle.<br/><br/>So many eldery people and pets with radically improved mobility - so many people who stopped taking ibuprofen for their back pain.  It seems that it has a beneficial effect for about 75% of people that use it.  I am a rational, empirically-minded person, and I can tell you with certainty that CBD significantly helps people with no perceivable side effects.  I have seen plenty of skeptics converted, thus reducing the possibility of placebo effect.<br/><br/>and because of the marijuana Schedule 1 insanity, the DEA could come after it at any time, which is crazy because it doesn&#39;t get you high.  If anything, it&#39;s anti-psychotic properties make you less high (if you&#39;re high on marijuana to begin with).<br/><br/>This is an amazing natural medicine, and the only reason I&#39;m in this position, writing you this comment, is due to the regrettable nexus of the corporate pharmaceutical situation (can&#39;t patent naturally occurring substances, so nobody will pay for the testing the FDA wants, creating a catch .22 situation) and the marijuana hysteria situation (Schedule 1, i.e. worse than heroin - really?).  I would be shocked if anybody with any rational, deductive-thinking abilities at all couldn&#39;t perceive what I&#39;m seeing and come to the conclusion that there has to be a saner, more humane path forward.<br/><br/>Considering the lamentable state of pain management in the US (doctors freely prescribing synthetic heroin for 20+ years and not anticipating the opioid epidemic we have now?), we need anything we can get to help people.  The fact that CBD is a naturally occurring, highly-effective agent that people have been using for 10,000+ years, but is the subject to the legal &amp; regulatory insanity, is a true testament to humankind&#39;s irrationality.<br/><br/>But, since humankind also has rationality, there are plenty of educated, reasonable people like myself that feel the exact same way about and have had the exact same experience with CBD and it&#39;s positive effects.<br/><br/>I&#39;m sorry if this is disjointed or a bit of a rant, I&#39;m very busy and this is what I came with off the top of my head, no revisions...<br/><br/>thank you for your time<br/><br/>Chris",

    "text": "I am writing in support of all four of the California coast&#39;s magnificent National Marine Sanctuaries, including the Channel Islands, Monterey Bay, Cordell Bank, and Greater Farallones Sanctuary sites. Each of these crown jewels of our nation&#39;s natural legacy stands as compelling testimony to the decades of bipartisan support expressed by our federal, state, and local elected officials based upon constructive participation by the millions of citizens who consistently called for their designation. While we understand that your agencies are under a brief mandate to conduct an objective and unbiased &quot;review&quot; of certain portions of our Marine Sanctuary sites, we also firmly believe that you will inevitably find that our state&#39;s clean-coast economy benefits greatly from the protections that these sites provide. The multitude of jobs that rely on expenditures by visitors from around the globe who come to enjoy these protected coastal assets supports the maritime heritage embodied by our artisanal family fisheries and maintains the economic health of our region. The most powerful ocean upwelling system in North America, among the four most important of such features in the world, provides the essential base of the marine food chain that generates the prolific web of life found throughout the Greater Farallones, Cordell Bank, and Monterey Bay sites. To the south, the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary is ideally situated at the confluence of a unique mixing zone where colder northern waters meet the warmer ocean currents from the south, creating a unique constellation of varied marine life amidst lush kelp forests. The periodic methodical inclusion of key ecosystem features within our Marine Sanctuaries has consistently been carried out using sound peer-reviewed science supported by robust public input through open citizen review and public hearings, and these processes have been duly undertaken in compliance with all relevant federal and state laws and regulatory frameworks. We urge that all reviewing agencies carefully consider the important economic benefits these sites provide and the broad public support that led to their designation in reaching the ultimate conclusion that no erosion of any of these permanently protected sites is indicated at this time. Thank you for your kind consideration.",

Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii&#39;s economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii&#39;s economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America&#39;s leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.",

They are an indispensable economic driver for coastal and ocean communities, generating $8 billion annually through commercial fishing, tourism, and recreation activities within protected areas. By restoring fisheries, protecting against the dangers of offshore oil drilling, and providing a buffer against climate change, marine sanctuaries are critical to the entire nations economy, health, and security. <br/><br/>Since President Nixon established the National Marine Sanctuary Program, bipartisan support from communities, Congress, and presidents has been critical to designate and expand marine sanctuaries. An attack on any marine sanctuary is an attack on the very fabric of American democracy. Please stand with the communities who advocated for marine protections and the people who support national marine sanctuaries and monuments.    ",
