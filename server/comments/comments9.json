    "text": "As someone with a Seizure, Hearing and Mobility Service Support Dog, I would like to comment on the impending changes to the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA). The primary issues faced by both people with disabilities, airline staff and the traveling public can be summed up and efficiently addressed by changing the ACAA definition of service animal to mirror that in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This definition does not encompass animals that are not task-trained and public access trained to assist someone with a disability. Such a definition also places responsibility for the animals behavior in the moment directly with the person to whom it is associated, not through elaborate validation schemes. <br/><br/>My service dog performs counter balance support, so he is a larger dog. Regarding species and size of service animals, I recommend that the ACAA follow the ADA in defining species of service animals. Large dogs like mine are often required to handle the needs of people with specific disabilities and I encourage the airline industry to explore ways to maintain adequate space under and around seats, not only for service animals but the comfort and safety of passengers in general.  <br/><br/>I&#39;d recommend as few barriers to travel for passengers with service animals as possible. With that in mind, I strongly discourage the validation schemes in favor of the limitation to task-trained animals, tethering requirements such as those prescribed in the ADA, and observation of behavior as determining factors for boarding, and continuing in the cabin during flight. I stand with the American Veterinary Association (AVMA) in their position that veterinarians are not equipped to judge or predict an animals behavior during air travel and hence veterinary statements, if necessary, should not include any attestation to training. Regarding provision of veterinary forms, this requirement was removed for task-trained service animals currently by many airlines due to undo burdens, which should answer the questions posed about such burdens. I&#39;d also like to each airlines to archive my files, so I do not have to submit them every time I travel.",

And those service dogs must have completed a tough and rigorous certification course set up by the DOT for behavior - crowds, tight spaces and other conditions found in airports, trains and terminals.  Until there is a certification process for emotional support, psych support or other medical condition dogs that individuals need for any reason, then these dogs should either not be allowed or required to be muzzled and contained in carriers especially for flights.

I do not want to share my assigned seat space as it is small already.<br/><br/>I really do not want to fly next to a dog or any animal and especially an untrained one.  The seats are too small, the floor space is non existent.  It is impossible to not touch or accidentally invade another seat space for a second while adjusting clothing which could trigger aggressive behaviors.  I do not want to worry about being bitten, attacked, scratched or arrive hair covered and smelly due to an animal on my flight or a previous one. Nor, do I want to listen to an animal whine, bark or scratch during my flight or in a confined area like a terminal.<br/><br/>I have restless leg syndrome and when it occurs, I need to move my legs nearly continuously, randomly and sometimes largely.  I dont want to worry that it could be interpreted as aggressive or annoying by an animal causing them to react in an aggressive manner.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, I believe only service dogs that have been certified an accredited process should be allowed on public transportation. <br/><br/>",

This would stop people from trying to pass of their pets as service animals because they could be asked to show this identification.  Note that even a licensed service animal is no guarantee of behavior in any given situation so personnel need to be trained to determine what is acceptable behavior versus non-acceptable behavior, and they should be allowed to refuse any animal that poses a health or safety issue to others.<br/><br/>There should be no size limit for a service animal; if they&#39;re properly trained, any size will do. <br/><br/>Service animals should ALWAYS be tethered in some way to its&#39; handler.<br/><br/>Health certificates should NOT be required for the service animal to travel.

Thats why I support clear, consumer-friendly GMO labels on ALL foods containing GMO ingredients. <br/><br/>The proposed rule allows companies to disclose GMOs solely through digital disclosures, while doing nothing to guarantee Americans without smartphones or cell service will have access to vital information about their food. <br/><br/>The USDA needs to ensure ALL Americans have access to GMO disclosures. Heres why: <br/><br/>- A Deloitte study found that nearly one-in-four Americans dont own a smartphone and that three-in-four dont know that you can scan QR codes to get production information. Most have never scanned a code to get food information, and 85 percent of Americans who have tried said they have struggled with mobile scanning apps. Compounding the fact that many Americans still dont have smartphones is the fact that more than 20 million American have lousy cell service. That means that it will take a long time for the GMO information to load  if it loads at all. <br/><br/>- The proposed rule currently does not provide comparable options. The text message option included in the proposed rule should not be considered a comparable option because it is not clear that this option must be included in addition to the digital disclosure. Additionally, millions of Americans who live in rural areas may not have reliable cellphone service that would allow them to send or receive text messages. <br/><br/>- The law clearly directs the USDA secretary to provide additional and comparable options so that consumers who dont have smartphones or live in parts of the country without reliable cellular service can access the GMO disclosure, if the agency determines they will not have sufficient access to the GMO disclosure through electronic or digital methods. <br/><br/>- Comparable options need to be just as convenient as it is for someone to pull out a smartphone to scan a product. This could most easily be achieved by requiring stores to place scanners in every aisle of grocery stores, unless a retailer requires that manufacturers disclose the presence of GMOs on packages. <br/><br/>I urge you to create a clear, consumer-friendly GMO labeling standard that ensures ALL Americans have access to vital information about their food. <br/><br/>Thank you",

    "text": "I believe that  NOSSCR has made several good points and raised multiple valid concerns in their comments. The mere use of hand held assistive devices that require both hands are not the only way to medically measure a disabling level of dysfunction when ambulating. For example, if an individual braces themselves on the walls of a hallway to walk they may have no use of their hands for carrying when they walk but would be precluded from being found medically disabled. The requirement for imaging to correspond to compromise of a nerve root can also be unnecessarily disqualifying. As noted by NOSSCR some claimant&#39;s lack the means or a provider willing to obtain advanced imaging that can show more detailed information to confirm compromise. Additionally, such imaging is not always accurate. Poor quality or poor interpretation can deny an individual rights to benefits even though they may have the other criteria. I have seen situations where an MRI does not identify compromise on imaging, but a surgeon has been willing to operate on clinical examination findings and has had direct visualization of compromise upon surgery.",

    "docAbstract": "This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) is divided into several parts. First, we provide the supplementary information, which is often referred to as the preamble. In the preamble, we explain why we propose to revise the listings for the musculoskeletal body system and how we developed the proposed rules. We also offer a narrative of the changes we are proposing. The preamble tells the story behind the proposed rule changes, but if we decide to proceed with a final rule, the preamble will not become part of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n\n\ue615 \nThe next section is the proposed revisions to the listing of impairments, located in Appendix 1 to Subpart P of 20 CFR part 404. For each body system affected by these proposed rules (e.g., 1.00 Musculoskeletal Disorders), we first provide proposed changes to the introductory text (e.g., 1.00A, B, C, etc.). If we decide to proceed with a final rule, the introductory text will become part of the Code of Federal Regulations. The introductory text details which disorders we evaluate and what evidence we need to conduct this evaluation. It also defines certain terms, and provides valuable background information. Individuals often refer to the introductory text for additional details related to a specific listing under which a medically determinable impairment (MDI) is being evaluated. After the introductory text, we provide specific listing text and criteria (e.g., 1.15 and 1.16). The listings themselves provide specific criteria that an MDI must meet (or medically equal) in order for an individual to be found disabled under the listings."

    "text": "Dear Sirs, now that the DARK act has been passed, taking away states&#39; rights in labeling, it is doubly important that a fair federal rule be put in place for GMO foods. The proposed rule is all for giant agribiz benefit, and should be altered. <br/>   The rule proposes that scanning QR squares will be the way to find out information. Scanning these speckled black squares with your smart phone will lead to additional product information. Of course this requires an internet connection and a smart phone or other device. It is estimated that 130 million Americans lack the resources to do this. Thus it is discriminatory. QR codes allow companies to camouflage their GMO ingredient information. This is not acceptable.<br/>   Also, the USDA has released some preliminary logos for potential use with GMO products. The smiley face, feel-good images suggested provide no value other than encouraging your acceptance of the product. The use of the lettering, BE, is disingenuous. It is supposed to stand for bioengineered, a term most consumers are not familiar with (most are familiar with GE/genetic engineering or GMO/genetically modified organism). This logo is unacceptable. To make it even more confusing, the image closely resembles logos used in the European Union to signify organic products. How insulting is that?  This logo is intentionally misleading and should be dumped.<br/>  The USDA remains undecided on whether processed foods made with GMO corn, soy, sugar beets, and canola must display GMO product information. Consumers have the right to know this information, and the USDA must require full disclosure of GMO ingredients in food products.<br/>  Please do the right thing and ignore the lobbying of Big Ag. Allow consumers the information they deserve. <br/>Thank you, Nancy McMillan",

By effectively banning these products---without first creating a market for less harmful alternative tobacco products---the FDA&#39;s possible rule is simply unfair and unreasonable.<br/><br/>Beyond just adult smokers, this possible rule would hurt our economy. A de facto ban on cigarettes would threaten American tobacco growers and manufacturing.  Given that the vast majority of cigarettes sold in the United States are manufactured domestically from American-grown tobacco, such an severe regulatory mandate would have a serious negative impact on U.S. manufacturing, agriculture, and jobs.<br/><br/>The FDA should focus its resources on a comprehensive plan that reduces harm and risk for adult tobacco consumers through proven strategies to prevent initiation, encourage cessation, and by the development of reduced risk alternatives to cigarettes that adult smokers like.

The FDA should not move forward without considering the impact it would have on adult smokers as well as our larger economy.<br/><br/>Once again, the government is trying to solve a problem by restricting choice rather than by giving adults more alternatives.  Rather than reduce choice for adult smokers, the FDA should focus on giving adult smokers more options and access to a wider choice of less harmful tobacco products, and truthful, accurate information about the benefits of switching to them.  Instead, this de facto ban would simply target adult smokers for purchasing the legal products they prefer.<br/><br/>FDA should focus resources on a comprehensive plan to reduce harm through proven strategies to prevent initiation, encourage cessation and by fostering the development of reduced risk alternatives to cigarettes that are satisfying to adult smokers.<br/><br/>Please do not consider such a severe and unfair proposal.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/> <br/>",

What was found instead was that new predators moved in to the area where the former <br/>predators had been removed from and recolonized the area, increasing the numbers of the  new predator over the one that <br/>was removed.<br/><br/>Also, there are ways to deal with the human conflict issue - electric fencing, bear-proof garbage cans, not leaving food out to attract bears,<br/>and &quot;re-wilding&quot; an ecosystem, or bringing in more animals that are natural prey for carnivores, which reduces their interest in other animals.<br/>Also, It&#39;s really the responsibility of people who may be living close to bear habitats to assume responsibility for bear proofing the areas<br/>where they live.<br/><br/>Finally, most Alaskans don&#39;t want hunters, backed by trophy hunting groups like Safari Club, to massacre the wild animals just<br/>so they can have something hanging on their walls.

In that time I have spent time in all of Alaska&#39;s National Parks.  I&#39;ve eaten lunch on mountaintops in the Brook&#39;s range while watching Bear and Wolverine below.  I&#39;ve watched Brown Bear on the barren landscape of Katmai.  And for nine days in a row, a pack of wolves visited our camp while hiking on the Great Kobuk Sand Dunes.  <br/><br/>To hear the National Park Service is attempting to roll back the 2015 wildlife protections in response to bureaucrats in DC makes me physically ill.  One of our country&#39;s greatest hunting advocates Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, said, &quot;In a civilized and cultivated country, wild animals only continue to exist at all when preserved by sportsmen.&quot;  Killing bear at bait stations and killing sows and cubs in their dens is not hunting.  It is the exact opposite of preservation. <br/>It is inhumane and completely unethical.  Our wildlife is in peril.  The National Parks and Preserves were, in part, created to protect and preserve wildlife.  <br/><br/>Our children need to be outdoors today more than ever.  And they need the outdoors to contain all the richness and diversity of wildlife possible.  I urge you to protect our wild spaces and reject the proposals allowing the slaughter of that wildlife.<br/><br/>Thank you.",

Imagine also having to care for a child or two as you are shopping and having to stop to get this information.

    "text": "Symbol 2A  that is my choice. I support labeling genetically engineered food and food products with symbol 2A and the word Bioengineered directly below symbol 2A. Consumers deserve transparency, and studies have shown that consumers trust genetically modified foods more when they are given the chance to see which foods are modified (see Mandatory labels can improve attitudes toward genetically engineered food by Jane Kolodinsky and Jayson L. Lusk in ScienceAdvances). Label 2A provides a clear, concise, and ubiquitous symbol that represents genetic engineering technology.<br/><br/>Food labels must be clear or they are ineffective. Bioengineered written text below symbol 2A is the clearest way to label bioengineered food products. This label is clear because it explains the BE in the logo and informs consumers that the label specifically refers to bioengineering in the context of agriculture. Scientists around the world have reached a consensus that genetically modified (GM) crops are just as safe as crops produced through conventional plant breeding. Label 2A reflects this by providing a nonthreatening symbol that requires little active effort to understand and does not diminish the importance of the science behind genetic engineering by being cutesy like the sun label. <br/><br/>Effective labeling requires more than a clear symbol; interested consumers must have access to more information about a technology that they find interesting. It is impossible to include such information on food labels, which are already small and difficult to read, but accurate information about the genetically engineered crops available in the United States should be easy for curious consumers to find. Canola, field corn, cotton, soybean, sugar beet, apple, sweet corn, papaya, potato, and squash each need a separate page on the USDA website explaining the GE technology present in these crops in an accessible way. This provides consumers with a starting place to learn more about genetic engineering if they are interested, and consumers can be linked to these pages by a QR code on food labels.<br/><br/>Finally, labeling must be ubiquitous. Part of the uncertainty about genetic engineering technologies comes from its apparent rarity. To date, most genetic engineering has focused on agronomic traits like insect resistance that benefit farmers, rather than end-use quality traits like color that are obvious to consumers. This makes genetic engineering largely invisible in the grocery store. Most consumers have no idea that a vast majority of the high fructose corn syrup in our favorite sugary snacks is made from genetically modified field corn, and this lends itself to the stigma around GMOs and genetic engineering as a technology. All crops that contain any level of genetic engineering above the 0.9% threshold proposed by the USDA should be labeled, as should products and crop derivatives made from genetically engineered crops. Genetic modification is ubiquitous and an important part of modern agriculture. Demonstrating the extent to which genetic engineering has been involved in producing popular products will help destigmatize a technology that has the potential to benefit U.S. producers and consumers alike. <br/>",

As a Baccalaureate prepared Registered nurse who holds national certification in adult critical care (CCRN) and is now in the process of earning a Doctorate of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree with a focus in nurse anesthesia, I can personally attest to the tremendous value nurses who meet the criteria for H-1B status bring to the healthcare workforce.  The Institute of Medicines (IOM) 2010 landmark report on the future of nursing emphasized the imperative nature of drastically expanding the number of nurses educated at both the Baccalaureate and Doctoral level, while simultaneously preparing nurses to care for an increasingly diverse patient population (IOM, 2010).  Nurses qualifying for H-1B status are ideally positioned to meet this charge.<br/>While didactic nursing education and real world clinical experience are not entirely mutually exclusive domains, each contribute in a complementary manner to high-quality cost-effective patient care outcomes.  A myriad of publications demonstrate the link between reduced patient mortality and failure to rescue rates with higher proportions of Baccalaureate prepared and specialty certified nursing staff (AACN, 2017).  Furthermore, given the current shortages in the nursing workforce and projected 16% growth required to keep pace with the increase in demand for nursing services (~1.09 million nurses by 2024), turning away well qualified, experienced nurses is simply too great an expense for the already overburdened healthcare system to incur (AACN, 2017).<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN). (2017). Nursing shortage fact sheet. Retrieved from http://www.aacnnursing.org/News-Information/Fact-Sheets/Nursing-Shortage<br/><br/>Institute of Medicine (IOM). (2010).

    "text": "My name is Tracy Carl I can not attend tonights meeting in Exeter NH. I wanted my story to be shared. I moved to Merrimack 12 years ago with our 9 month old son and pregnant with our second son. Who was of low birth weight , thought to have downs and was born having breathing difficultly had speech delays and now has other learning disabilities. My third pregnancy seemed to go well. But i myself was getting sicker. Then came my fourth child my amazing little girl.  As the years went by we had to rip the rugs out of my entire house thinking they were making me sick, we had the house tested for mold.   Nothing was found.  At this point I felt as though my body was giving up as I had four children under that age of 5. Doctors said it was due to the pregnancies, at first. then it was finally said well we think its an auto immune that we just cant seem to place or understand.  So I was dx with an unknown auto autoimmune.  It would not be for another 5 year of struggling would we find that our water was contaminated, the air we breath, the water we drink, the water we swim in, the water we grow our vegetables with, the soil, all of it was contaminated at some levels. Levels in which no one would tell us if they were truly safe. After many doctors over the years in and out of Boston seeing specialists they believed my issues, celiac, mass in my adrenal gland, my auto auto immune issues  weird sores I develop on my body that always come back negative for any thing!! I am not allergic to anything I have been pricked many times and they finally believe it all stem from something in the environment!  what from the environment we did not know but thats what they were thinking.  Well then comes 2016. And we find out our water is make me sick!!!  My oldest has been dx with so many things is hard to even begin.  My son is 12 years old and weighs. 62 lbs! Has many dx associated with autism but has not been officially dx as he does not meet all the requirements YET!!  My daughter suffers from chronic pain in her joints both in her  feet and hands! Which  doctors from Boston still are not sure why.  We do not drink the water, we do not cook with the water!ANYMORE! Everyone said I was lucky to be hooked up to town water when my neighbors was told their wells were contaminated, when i was toId my weII is contaminated!!! No I was not lucky. I have always been on MVD water and I was not lucky. I was and am still sick. My husband is a Ewing sarcoma cancer survivor he was 21. And had his first real job working for a company that makes semi conductors.  I just recently read an article about how these chemicals are used in the making of semiconductors?  Could that be what caused his cancer all Those years ago!!! Has he now been exposed  to the same chemicals!!!!! Please help us clean our water and make our town, our state, our country have Clean safe water!! Dont let these companies tell us what to do!! Filter our water filter our poor childrens water!!! Please help us understand what these chemicals have done to us, done to our Children! We requested they filter out schools water and they said &quot;NO&quot; ! i don&#39;t see how that goes long with their commitment to communities!<br/>Hep us to help make it better for us and them in the future!!!! I am asking to regulate aII PFCs even the ones we are still Iearnign about. don&#39;t make us be Iab rats any more. Make the limits under 1 ug. <br/>Tracy CarI<br/>101 Joppa rd <br/>Merrimack, NH 03054<br/>978-918-3899",

    "docAbstract": "Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) is a category of man-made chemicals that have been widely used to make products because of their stain-resistant, waterproof and/or nonstick properties. These chemicals can be very persistent in the environment and in the human body \u2013 meaning they don\u2019t break down quickly and they can accumulate over time. There is evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to adverse health outcomes in humans.\n\nAdditional information: https://www.epa.gov/pfas \n\nEPA is committed to supporting states, tribes and local communities in addressing challenges with PFAS.  As a part of this effort, EPA is taking action to identify solutions to address PFAS in the environment.\n\nEPA is hosting a National Leadership Summit on May 22nd and May 23rd to aid in identifying solutions to address PFAS challenges in drinking water and at contaminated sites. Following the meeting, EPA plans to visit states with communities impacted by PFAS to further engage on ways the agency can best support the work that\u2019s being done at the state, local and tribal levels. Using information from the National Summit and community engagements, EPA plans to develop a PFAS Management Plan for release later this year.\n\nEPA provides the opportunity for the public to submit input on how EPA can best help states and communities facing this issue. EPA will consider comments as the agency plans next steps."

The above snippet shows Trump&#39;s mastery of social media:<br/>- accuse the accusers, investigate the investigators, report on the reporters, etc.<br/>- convict opponents of crimes first, come up with charges later<br/>- use Random Capitalization to demonstrate being &quot;like a really smart guy&quot;<br/>- use ellipses (6 of em!) because Trump hasn&#39;t figured out that twitter isn&#39;t intended to support essays<br/><br/>Just like Palin, Trump doesn&#39;t need parody.
