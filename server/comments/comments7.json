    "text": "RE: Docket HHSOS20180008 Department of Health and Human Services RIN 0937-ZA00, Proposed Rule for Compliance With Statutory Program Integrity Requirements <br/><br/>Dear Secretary Azar, Senior Advisor Huber, and Deputy Assistant Secretary Foley:<br/><br/>YWCA USA submits these comments on the proposed rule published at 83 FR 25502 (June 1, 2018), RIN 0937-ZA00, with the title, Compliance with Statutory Program Integrity Requirements (the Proposed Rule or Rule). <br/><br/>As one of the oldest and largest womens organizations in the nation, YWCA USA is dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering women, and promoting peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all. Today, we serve over 2 million women, girls, and their families through a network of 210 local associations in 46 states and the District of Columbia by combining programming and advocacy to generate lasting change in the areas of racial justice and civil rights, empowerment and economic advancement for women and girls, and health and safety of women and girls. YWCA has been at the forefront of the most pressing social movements for more than 160 years.<br/><br/>YWCA believes that quality, affordable healthcare is critical for everyone, but for many women, particularly women of color, those who are low-income, and those who are survivors of violence, medical care often remains inaccessible. This is why we write to express our opposition to the Proposed Rule, which would interfere with the doctor-patient relationship and deny Title X patients information they need to stay healthy and undermine Title Xs goals of providing comprehensive reproductive health services to people with low incomes. Additionally, the Proposed Rule radically underestimates the likely costs it will impose on patients, providers, and on society. Finally, the Rule would exacerbate existing health disparities  impacting essential access to health for communities of color at much higher rates.<br/><br/>Almost two-thirds of those attending Title X-funded clinics come from households with incomes below the federal poverty level. Nearly 90 percent of Title X recipients have incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and 48 percent are uninsured.  Planned Parenthood health centers serve over 40 percent of Title X patients; hospitals, family planning councils, federally qualified health centers, and other private nonprofit organizations make up the rest of the Title X network. Every year, more than 4 million low-income, including under-insured and uninsured individuals, rely on Title X clinics to access services they otherwise might not be able to afford.  Of these clients, more than half are women of color: 30 percent identify as either Black, Asian, Asian or Pacific Islander, or American Indian or Alaska Native, and another 32 percent of clients identify as Latinx.  Title X is an essential source of publicly-funded health care for these communities, and this Rule would have a devastating impact on women and their families across the country.<br/><br/>Women, particularly women of color, those who are low-income, and those who are survivors of domestic and sexual violence, need publicly-funded essential family planning services to ensure quality health care, to plan their pregnancies, and to protect the future for themselves and their families. The Proposed Rule threatens to significantly harm this crucial health care right and will have a devastating impact on women and families across the county. To address these and other concerns, we urge the Department to reject the Rule in its entirety. <br/><br/>YWCA appreciates the opportunity to share our views with you. If you have any questions, please contact YWCA USA Vice President of Public Policy and Advocacy, Catherine Beane, at cbeane@ywca.org or 202-835-2354. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Alejandra Y. Castillo, CEO YWCA USA<br/>",

    "text": "I strongly oppose the proposed changes to Title X funding.  As an OBGYN, I know how critical the resources provided by the Title X program to women across the country are.  This proposed change is an assault to women throughout the country. It requires physicians to violate the doctor-patient relationship by withholding information on the safest and most effective methods of family planning and thus violate their Hippocratic oath.  The Title X program is the only federal grant program dedicated to supporting family planning services to low-income individuals.  Clinics funded by Title X do not only provide family planning services, which are an essential component of womens health care.  They also provide critical primary and preventive care services such as cancer screenings and STI treatment.  As a military physician, I have lost track of the number of service women who were separating from the military and did not yet civilian health insurance established.  For years, I have been able to confidently refer them to Title X clinics to continue their cancer screenings, treatments and other essential care.  The proposed changes to the Title X clinics will negatively impact womens health care throughout the country, and very especially that of our female veterans.  Please reject these proposed changes to Title X and continue to protect womens health care in our country.",

    "docAbstract": "STEEL:\n\nStarting June 13, 2019, use the following link: https://trade.gov/232/steelalum for the submittal of new exclusion requests. \n\nExclusion requests and objections to submitted exclusion requests for STEEL must be submitted to regulations.gov docket number BIS-2018-0006. \n\nThis regulations.gov docket number BIS-2018-0006 is being used for three purposes:\n\n(1) Submitting comments on the interim final rule;\n(2) Submitting exclusion requests for steel; and\n(3) Submitting objections to submitted exclusion requests for steel. \n\nSummary of interim final rule:\nThis interim final rule amends the National Security Industrial Base Regulations to add two new supplements.  The new supplements set forth the process for how parties in the United States may submit requests for exclusions from actions taken by the President (\u201cexclusion requests\u201d) to protect national security from threats resulting from imports of specified articles.  The new supplements also set forth the requirements and process for how parties in the United States may submit objections to the granting of an exclusion request.  \n\nThe supplements are being added to implement Presidential Proclamations 9704 and 9705 of March 8, 2018 (\u201cProclamations\u201d), adjusting imports of steel articles identified in Proclamation 9705 (\u201csteel\u201d) and aluminum articles identified in Proclamation 9704 (\u201caluminum\u201d) through the imposition of duties so that imports of steel articles and aluminum articles will no longer threaten to impair the national security.  As set forth in the Proclamations, the President concurred with the findings of the Secretary of Commerce (\u201cSecretary\u201d) in two reports to the President on the investigations under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862), of the effect of imports of steel and aluminum, respectively, on the national security of the United States.  The Proclamations authorize the Secretary to grant exclusions from the duties upon request of affected parties if the steel or aluminum articles are determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality or based upon specific national security considerations.  The President directed the Secretary to promulgate regulations as may be necessary to set forth the procedures for an exclusion process.\n\nNOTE: For exclusion requests and objections to submitted exclusion requests for aluminum see regulations.gov docket number BIS-2018-0002."

The proposed regulations violate core tenets of medical ethics, including honest information and informed consent; misconstrue family planning and ignore patient needs; muzzle the free speech and free exercise rights of doctors and other health care providers; substitute religion for medicine, flout the Establishment clause, and trample on patients free exercise rights; disregard the conscience of providers who hold moral obligations to honesty and truth and understand abortion as an act of conscience; and contribute to conditions that increase rather than decrease the severe and troubling maternal mortality rates in the United States. For these reasons and more, as I will explain below (in the attached document), I ask that the Department not move forward with these rules. ",

Extreme sport hunting methods, like brown bear baiting and killing hibernating black bear mothers and cubs in dens, don&#39;t belong on national preserves in Alaska.<br/>National parks and preserves in Alaska were set aside by Congress as special places where bears, wolves and other wildlife roam as part of a natural ecosystem. The National Park Service&#39;s proposal to allow extreme hunting practices turns the idea of special places on its head. I urge you to protect our last, best chance to make sure our children inherit a world with wild spaces and wildlife.<br/>Thank you for considering my comments.<br/> ",

    "text": "Comment from National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW) Opposing the Department of Health and Human Services Proposed Rule: Compliance with Statutory Program Integrity Requirements (PDF including footnotes attached)<br/><br/>National Advocates for Pregnant Women writes to oppose the Departments proposed rule amending several provisions of Title X in 42 C.F.R. Part 59, because the rule would undermine womens health care at a time when outcomes in womens health care are at an all-time low. The Department would better serve its purpose of promoting health by leaving the existing regulations as they are. <br/><br/>Maternal mortality rates are higher in the United States than in any other developed nation in the world. Not only are the rates of maternal mortality and morbidity in this country bad, but they are getting worse. This is despite the fact that the United States spends more than any other country on health care, while accomplishing less. Furthermore, there are grave disparities in infant and maternal outcomes such that a black woman is 22 percent more likely to die from heart disease than a white woman, 71 percent more likely to perish from cervical cancer, but 243 percent more likely to die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related causes. And these maternal health disparities cannot be blamed on the economic position or general health of individual women. <br/><br/>The Department would do better to spend the money and staff time associated with revising these regulations and overseeing compliance by focusing instead on how reproductive health care policies are impacting maternal health outcomes. The proposed gag rule demeans women and will do nothing to improve the life-threatening problems with doctor-patient communication that already exist.  <br/><br/>As an organization that focuses on the health and human rights of pregnant women, NAPW knows that putting an inordinate focus on the fetus over the health and welfare of the woman who carries that fetus leads to negative outcomes, including criminalization and control of pregnant women. NAPW also knows that such punitive policies drive women away from needed health care. The condition of maternity care in this country is a symptom of grossly distorted reproductive health care policies shaped more by political pressures than by what is best for women and infants. The proposed rulemaking continues in that vein and should not be adopted.<br/><br/>Sources<br/><br/>Alison Young. Hospitals know how to protect mothers. They just arent doing it.

    "text": "Dear Secretary Azar,<br/><br/>I am writing to strongly oppose the Proposed Rule released by the Department of Health and Human Services entitled Compliance With Statutory Program Integrity Requirements (HHS-OS-2018-0008). The Proposed Rule would make radical changes to the Title X federal family planning program that could significantly impede access to time-sensitive and essential health care for the millions of low-income individuals that are served by the program each year. Californias Title X program is the largest and most comprehensive Title X system in the nation that serves over 1,000,000 patients at over 350 health centers throughout the state. Title X funding saves California approximately $1.3 billion annually in costs related to unintended pregnancy.<br/><br/>I oppose the Proposed Rule for the following reasons:<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Patients need and deserve comprehensive information to make informed decisions about their health in a timely manner in order to achieve their reproductive goals and optimal health outcomes. If enacted, the Proposed Rule will force Title X grantees to not only withhold accurate information about abortion, but to also steer patients to providers that may not offer the treatment they need. It will also force many qualified providers to discontinue participation in the program and will result in gaps in care in regions throughout California and the country.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Title X patients must have access to comprehensive, patient-centered family planning care. The Proposed Rule allows entities to receive Title X funding even if they only provide a single method of contraception, rather than a broad range of birth control methods. Studies show that women who are able to use the method of their choice are more likely to use that method correctly and consistently, and in turn, greatly reduce their risk for unintended pregnancy. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Teens must have access to Title X providers that they can trust to provide quality, teen-friendly care in their local communities. The Proposed Rule requires Title X providers to collect and document personal and private information that could harm the relationship between doctors and patients and discourage patients  particularly teens - from obtaining essential family planning and related services. This will likely lead to increased rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs among adolescents and increased government costs.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Separation requirements must not deny Title X patients timely access to qualified providers. The extreme physical separation requirements included in the Proposed Rule will eliminate qualified providers from the Title X program. This could greatly reduce access to care. If all qualified family planning providers that also provide abortion services were to be eliminated from the Title X family planning program in California, 19 California counties would be left without a Title X-funded health center and many local health systems would find it difficult to absorb the patients left behind as a result.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Limited Title X resources must be reserved for low-income individuals in need of publicly supported family planning services. Congress established the Title X program to create a pathway for low-income and uninsured individuals to access family planning care. The Proposed Rule seeks to allow women to receive family planning services under the Title X program if their employer refuses to cover contraceptive care based on religious or moral objections, regardless of their income. Redefining low income to include this population will divert scarce resources away from serving the low-income patients at the heart of Title Xs purpose.<br/><br/>For these reasons and more, I urge you to rescind the Proposed Rule and maintain the Title X program as Congress intended, to expand access to low-income individuals in need of essential family planning services that promote public health and save taxpayer dollars.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Dan Adamsky",

All patients, no matter their service mechanism, expect and deserve medically accurate, comprehensive information from their providers, and it is unethical and dangerous for a governmental body to compromise patient health by interfering with the provision of that care and information. Title X providers must be allowed to provide the broad range of contraceptive methods with nondirective options counseling, not withhold full and accurate medical information from patients, and provide confidential care. As such, BCHC stands with our partners across the health landscape in firm opposition to these regulatory proposals. <br/>",

    "text": "The Door  A Center of Alternatives, Inc. (The Door) is pleased to provide comments to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), Compliance with Statutory Program Requirements, RIN 0937-ZA00.<br/><br/>For over 40 years, The Door has served as an invaluable resource for New York City youth, including those facing homelessness, unemployment, poverty, and deportation. The Doors mission remains to empower young people to reach their potential by providing comprehensive youth services in a diverse and caring environment. Each year, The Door engages nearly 10,000 youth, ages 12-24, many of whom have one or more barrier impacting their ability to thrive. Comprehensive services are offered free of charge to adolescents including: primary and behavioral health, education and career, creative arts, food and nutrition, legal and immigration, and supportive housing. Our Adolescent Health Center, a federally qualified health center and NCQA Level 3 Patient-Centered Medical Home, serves 4,000 young people every year with primary care services, sexual reproductive care, behavioral health, specialty services (eye care, dental, dermatology), and health education. We are the only adolescent health center embedded in a comprehensive youth development center in New York City.<br/><br/>The Door is deeply concerned that the NPRM will have devastating negative effects on the Title X family planning program and the low-income patients for whom Title X provides critical health care. In this past calendar year, The Door saw 2,660 patients for family planning services. The proposed rule attempts to impose unethical limits on pregnancy counseling and to mandate misleading information for patients, going beyond even the Reagan-era so-called domestic gag rule. The rule would: move Title X away from its proper focus on making modern family planning tools available to all, regardless of income; create unworkable and unclear physical separation and compliance requirements; prevent highly qualified, trusted family planning providers from continuing in their long-standing Title X roles; and destabilize the enormously effective network of Title X providers, thereby effectively destroying the program. <br/><br/>All of the rules harmful changes are proposed without any evidence of need or rationale. HHS seems to have consulted neither family planning providers, their patients, nor experts in the field. Indeed, the proposal is contradicted by HHSs own standards of care for family planning. The well-documented successes of the Title X program to date show just how misguided these changes are.<br/><br/>Collectively, the provisions of the 2018 NPRM would undermine the high-quality family planning care provided to almost 4 million patients in todays Title X program and make less effective services available to fewer patients. Although the rule in many ways is designed to target abortion-related activities and entities that provide abortion care, its impact is not limited to such activities and/or providers. The NPRM would have far-reaching implications for all Title X-funded entities, the services provided, and the ability of patients to seek and receive high-quality, confidential family planning and sexual health care. For these reasons, The Door urges HHS to withdraw the proposed rule.<br/>",

    "text": "The Bucks County Womens Advocacy Coalition is a non-partisan coalition of more than 250 Bucks County individuals and 43 non-profit organizations that educate and advocate together for systemic change to promote gender equity and economic security for all. Our comments herein relate to two of the ten principles that guide all of our advocacy: 1) Women must have access to appropriate health care for all family members, and 2) women must be free from predatory, exploitative, and abusive practices and persons.<br/><br/>As an advocate for women and children, we write to express our vehement opposition to this proposed rule, which would ban Title X providers from giving women full, accurate and complete information about their health care options. Women are not able to attain permanent economic security if they are unable to plan their families and they must be able to trust that their health care providers will provide them with the accurate and complete medical information that they need to understand all their options.  Health care providers are highly trained specialists and they and their patients must not be constrained by governmental regulations from freely discussing all appropriate medically approved options. <br/><br/>The provisions within the proposed rule are clearly designed to remake the Title X network by pushing out reproductive health-focused providers and bringing in providers that do not focus on reproductive health care. Bucks County is too wealthy for a government funded community health clinic, so our uninsured and low-income men and women rely on Planned Parenthood to provide their reproductive health services. In our community, Planned Parenthood has an excellent reputation for providing affordable, quality health care and health education. Should Planned Parenthood be required to substantially change their programs due to loss of Title X funding, Bucks County residents would be left with no access to medically accurate and complete reproductive health services and information. While Bucks County has two free volunteer health clinics, these clinics rely on Planned Parenthood services to provide reproductive health services that they, as volunteer clinics, are unable to meet.  <br/><br/>In states that have eliminated Planned Parenthood from their family planning programs, the public health results have been disastrous. A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that blocking patients from going to Planned Parenthood in Texas resulted in a 35 percent decline in women in publicly funded programs using the most effective methods of birth control and a 27 percent increase in births among women who had previously accessed injectable contraception through those programs. Moreover, public health officials fear a domestic gag rule, could cripple federal efforts to stop a dramatic increase in sexually transmitted diseases in the U.S.<br/><br/>By contrast, Colorados program to provide access to free long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) resulted in a drop in the birthrate among teenagers of 40 percent from 2009 to 2013, and a drop in the rate of abortions by 42 percent.  Savings of $49 to $111 million in birth-related Medicaid costs was also reported during the period that free LARCs were freely available. With this evidence, why is the proposed rule seeking to eliminate Planned Parenthood, a major provider of family planning services, as a reproductive health provider  even in communities where there are no comparable services?  If this rule is enacted, we fully expect to see an increase in unplanned pregnancy especially among teens and low-income women.<br/><br/>While Bucks County does not have a physician shortage, we do have a shortage of physicians who accept Medicaid reimbursement, and we have no government funded community health centers. Thus, Bucks County providers are not capable of absorbing the patients currently served by Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood not only provides quality family planning services, but also preventive health screenings, such as mammograms, cancer screenings and STD testing and treatment. Loss of Title X funding would dramatically impact the men, women and teens in Bucks County who have no access to another source of health care.  <br/><br/>This ruling proposes that other programs could be funded but the proposed regulations do little to assure that these services are, in fact, quality, comprehensive medical services. Our families deserve to be served by government programs that are designed based on both what is needed and what works.   <br/> <br/>In short, the proposed rule would gravely harm women and families in Bucks County and would exacerbate existing public health issues and health disparities. We strongly urge you to not finalize the proposed rule.<br/><br/>",
