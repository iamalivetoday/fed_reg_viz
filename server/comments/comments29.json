    "text": "Prior to retirement I was involved with the management of both US and foreign flag commercial vessels for 35 years.  During that time I had multiple opportunities to observe how the USCG interacted with vessel owners.  In many cases the USCG has established the best practices for the industry through the regulatory process.  Over time the international community has adopted these practices as part of international standards.  As a result, some of the current USCG programs have outlived their usefulness resulting in a duplication of efforts by both the US government and the owners consuming resources for plan review and record retention.  In response to the USCG notice, the following regulations are considered outdated, unnecessary and impose costs that exceed benefits.<br/><br/>1. Foreign flag gas carrier Certificate of Compliance (CoC):  The requirement for a USCG plan review originated in the 1960&#39;s when there were no international standards for the design of vessels transporting liquefied gases in bulk.  The USCG implemented a Gas Carrier Letter of Compliance Program, based upon Interim Guidelines developed from regulations contained in 46 CFR Part 38.  These Interim Guidelines were considered by IMO in the drafting of the IGC Code.  The IGC Code was incorporated in the US domestic regulations in 46 CFR Part 154; however, there are slight differences between the international and domestic regulations which resulted in the CoC plan review requirements.  The IGC Code has been in force for 40 years with a proven safety record and without incidents related to the items covered in a Subchapter O Endorsement plan review required for a CoC.  Over time the domestic and international requirements have further converged.  Consequently, an IGC Code certificate issued by a foreign vessel&#39;s National Administration should be sufficient without the need for an additional USCG plan review.  A Port State inspection for IGC Code compliance remains appropriate.  The following regulations could be eliminated in whole or part without degrading public safety:<br/><br/>a. 46 CFR 154.22 - Foreign Flag Vessel: Certificate of Compliance endorsement application<br/>b. 46 CFR 154.24 - Foreign Flag Vessel: IMO Certificate<br/>c. 46 CFR 154.151 - Procedures for having the Coast Guard examine a vessel for a Certificate of Compliance<br/>d. 46 CFR 154.1802 - Certificates, letters and endorsements: Foreign flag vessels<br/><br/>2. Foreign Flag vessel SOPEP approval:  OPS &#39;90 established the domestic requirement for a SOPEP, independent of then current international requirements.  IMO subsequently added Regulation 37 to MARPOL 73/78 which required an Administration approved SOPEP.  Regulations 37 contains the same general requirements as the USCG regulations with less specificity.  Over the past 20 years, the USCG required format has become the industry standard for these plans which are frequently prepared by contractors specializing in their preparation using a standard template.  The necessary local response information could be provided as part of the vessel&#39;s arrival notice.  The following regulations could be eliminated in whole or part without degrading environmental risk:<br/><br/>a. 33 CFR 151.27 - Plan submission and approval<br/>b. 33 CFR 151.28 - Plan review and revision<br/><br/>",

    "text": "Extensive new Animal ID requirements could have significant impacts on our agricultural and food system.<br/> <br/>I buy my food from small farmers who would be particularly hard hit by the cost and burdens associated with electronic ID. I do not want to see the farmers who provide food for my family and me burdened by requirements for the benefit of those who are exporting to other countries. A local food system is vital to our health, economy, and food security, and I urge USDA to prioritize the needs of small farmers.Any action by USDA should be limited to the question of whether young cattle should be required to be identified when crossing state lines. That is the issue that USDA committed to reviewing when it adopted Animal Disease Traceability (ADT) just a few years ago.<br/><br/> Why are consumers so concerned? :<br/>It&#39;s too expensive. The profit margins for most livestock producers are tiny. A NAIS-type program means not only buying RFID tags (which are more expensive than the traditional metal or plastic ones), but having the infrastructure to properly place the tags, read the tags, and manage the data. This expense will be passed on to the consumer. Which means you are putting my family&#39;s health in jeopardy!!!<br/><br/>IT DOESN&#39;T ADDRESS ANIMAL DISEASE!!!<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Traceability is part of being able to control and limit the spread of disease-but it does nothing to actually prevent or cure disease. THE REAL FOCUS NEEDS TO BE PREVENTION!!!!  If the government and industry spent even a tiny portion of the time that they have spent on NAIS on decreasing or even eliminating overcrowding in feedlots,mandating better nutrition and blocking the overuse of drugs, while also preventing imports from countries with outbreaks, we would have far healthier animals and less risk of disease in this country. But those things cost you the government and the industry money and limit access to international markets, so you would rather focus on tagging and tracking animals as a smokescreen to the real problem. Whatever happened to taking care of your own people?? Do what is best for us as a nation not other countries!!!!<br/><br/>It&#39;s about money. The real reason the industry players want electronic ID and tracking is to boost their own profits. Not to mention the profits to be had from selling tens of millions of electronic tags, or from managing the massive databases that would be part of the system. Multiple companies and trade organizations stand to make a lot of money from the program-at the expense of the vast majority of farmers and ranchers.<br/>We don&#39;t need every animal to have an electronic tag in its ear and its information entered in a database.It may be better to have the exporters pick up this tab!!!    What we need are programs that support independent producers making it possible for the consumers to get better quality food, a vibrant competitive market where people can make a living and provide quality products, and healthy animal management to prevent disease instead of trying to cure after the fact.

    "text": "I chose the topic of the Medicare Program: Prospective Payment System and Consolidated Billing for Skilled Nursing Facilities: Revisions To Case-Mix Methodology where this proposed rule document was issued by the Centers For Medicare Medicaid Services.  According to Medcare Program (2009), This advance notice of proposed rulemaking to solicit public comments on potential options can be considered for revising certain aspects of the existing skilled nursing facility, the prospective payment system payment methodology to improve its accuracy, based on the results of the Skilled Nursing Facility Payment Models Research project.  In particular, the agency is seeking comments on the possibility of replacing the Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System &#39; existing case-mix classification model, the Resource Utilization Groups, Version 4, with a new model, the Resident Classification System, Version I.  Also discussed would be options for how such a change could be implemented, as well as a number of other policy changes that may considered to complement implementation of Resident Classification System, Version I.<br/>The question arises as to the available options to consider for revising certain aspects of the existing Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System payment methodology.  The payment methodology revisions would allow for improving the ability for Medicare to pay adequately and appropriately for all services provided during a Medicare Part A skilled nursing facility stay.  (Grabowski, Huckfeldt, Sood, Escarce &amp; Newhouse, 2012).  This reasoning seems thought out and applicable.  If a skilled nursing facility stay meets the medical needs of a patient and that particular patient has been referred to this health care along the correct lines then the facility should receive payment for its services in a timely fashion without problems.  It is duly recorded that many skilled nursing facilities oftentimes have to obstacles in getting their proper reimbursements for care provided from Medicare.  Many of these obstacles are the result of inconsistent and incorrect billing and coding from medical personnel.  Sometimes a patient&#39;s chart will have varied charges and codes for the same procedures that subsequently result in Medicare payment denials and late payments.<br/>This is a dilemma because the most important component, which would be the patient may end up receiving improper and delayed care because of denied or late Medicare payments to the skilled nursing facility.  There have been many cases of this happening and the varied results that have been experienced by the person seeking health care.  One of the most important comments that I believe should be made regarding this is that those medical personnel responsible for billing and coding and the medical personnel responsible for providing the initial information within the health record should be checked and double checked for completeness and accuracy and the assurance that the medical condition noted is comparable to the subsequent billing and coding.  (Carter, Garrett &amp; Wissoker, 2012).  Since there are so many interrelated parts to ensure that Medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities get done accurately all parties and participants should work together to make sure that the task is done to excellent standards and this is a revision that would make sense and provide a positive outcome to the skilled nursing facility, Medicare and the patient.  The Centers For Medicare Medicaid Services should look into making sure that this revision is reviewed on a regular basis as of course it is something that is already in place.  But the problem is that oftentimes the problem re-occurs so the process needs to be monitored regularly and quickly resolved when necessary.<br/> <br/>References<br/><br/>Carter, C., Garrett, A.

I represent myself as a concerned citizen of the Western United States about the potential ground water contamination from Uranium and Thorium mill tailings.  My proposal is in reference to the Health and Environmental Protection Standards for Uranium and Thorium Mill Tailings proposed rule. Specifically the elimination of the 30-year-long monitory provision proposed by the previous version. <br/><br/>Initially, I was skeptical for the removal of the 30-year-long monitoring provision from the previous proposal. After reading the updated stability standards for obtaining a long term license, I find the proposed three years of quarterly monitoring with a 95 percent confidence level of no increasing trends to be acceptable but not preferable. I would still like to see some kind of periodic follow-up monitoring at a greater interval of five to ten years for public assur-ance of compliance. I bring this up because potential ground shifting or horizontal movement could lead to unexpected or delayed movement of hazardous material to an aquifer (Saunders, 79). <br/><br/>Geographically, the uranium mining locations I am most concerned about are in my neighboring state of Wyoming. As I type this, my local news is reporting the largest earthquake in Wyoming in since 2014 (Earthquake shakes NW Yellowstone area). The presence of frequent ground movement in the state gives credence for a long term monitoring solution. The EPA had reason to propose the 30 year monitoring and I would like to believe the extended monitoring has been removed to further protect public health and not shareholder profit. <br/><br/>While it is disturbing that existing standards for ground water had not been applied to Uranium In-Situ Recovery (ISR) facilities, I applaud the effort to amend this oversight and would like to clarify that I do support the proposal. I find the amount of decision making authority given to the regulatory agency for licensing to be flexible while offering assurance of increased compliance to the public. My impression of this document leads me to believe that, besides the issue identified in the previous paragraph, the proposed rules in this document will be a good tool to positively impact the environment, public health, and public assurance. Thank you for the opportunity to comment, I do not wish to further comment.<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/><br/>Ben Darr<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>&quot;Earthquake shakes NW Yellowstone area&quot; (2017).

As a historian and ancient coin collector I am aware that there is a push by many entities to limit the ability of ancient coin collectors in the U.S. to acquire and study these coins. The concept that ancient coins belong only to the country of origin is silly on its face. Consider that Roman coins may be found in China, India, Russia, all of the Middle East, North Africa, and all of Europe. Which modern country should be able to claim them. The answer is none of the above. They were issued in the millions by the Roman Empire an entity that no longer exists. During its existence Rome had over a hundred mints in operation. It is not unusual to find a coin minted in Odessa turning up in Great Britain. That same coin may have a collector value of a dollar or less. Remember they were often minted in the millions. Coins of the Emperor Probus are good examples of this. Hardly worth getting a permission from some bureaucratic agency is it?

I am writing today to request that you amend the Final Rule, titled &quot;Food Labeling; Nutrition Labeling of Standard Menu Items in Restaurants and Similar Retail Food Establishment&quot; (&quot;Rule&quot;), issued on Dec. 1, 2014, to provide for more flexible options for restaurateurs across the country. <br/> <br/>As currently written, the Rule requires that caloric information be displayed on the menus and menu boards next to the name or price of the item. The calories must be posted in a type face that is the size of either the name or the price, whichever is smaller, and must be in the same color &quot;or at least as conspicuous&quot; as the name used for the item. Other information, including total calories, total fat, calories from fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, fiber, sugars and protein, must be provided in written form upon consumer request and noted as such on menus and menu boards.<br/><br/>This Rule creates a one-standard-fits-all model that does not take into consideration the unique nature of the restaurant business, including the hundreds of combinations of food items that impact the nutritional data. It also does not allow for a quick service restaurant owner like me to cure even minor violations (a number falling off a drive-thru menu, for example) without facing criminal and civil penalties.

I am writing today to request that you amend the Final Rule, titled &quot;Food Labeling; Nutrition Labeling of Standard Menu Items in Restaurants and Similar Retail Food Establishment&quot; (&quot;Rule&quot;), issued on Dec. 1, 2014, to provide for more flexible options for restaurateurs across the country. <br/><br/>As is currently written, the Rule requires that caloric information be displayed on the menus and menu boards next to the name or price of the item. The calories must be posted in a type face that is the size of either the name or the price, whichever is smaller, and must be in the same color &quot;or at least as conspicuous&quot; as the name used for the item. Other information, including total calories, total fat, calories from fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, fiber, sugars and protein, must be provided in written form upon consumer request and noted as such on menus and menu boards.<br/><br/>The current Rule creates a one-standard-fits-all model that does not take into consideration the unique nature of the restaurant business, including the hundreds of combinations of food items (such as amounts and types of buffalo wing sauce) that impact the nutritional data.  It also does not allow for restaurant owners like me to cure even minor violations without facing criminal and civil penalties. Furthermore, while the rule includes an exemption for operations with fewer than 20 locations, the exemption does not apply to franchisees like me who operate an independent business.<br/><br/>I ask that you reconsider the Rule to allow for more flexible posting alternatives. For example, allowing restaurant owners to place information on one listing designated as the &quot;menu&quot; or &quot;menu board&quot; will lessen posting errors, as well as the burden on employers like me.

As provided in a number of comments submitted on the proposed rule, the reduction in emissions from reviewing leaks at thousands of wellheads is less than the emissions generated by the trucks driven to do the monitoring.  The cost of the manpower for a crew to go monitor, another crew to go fix the leaks and then another crew to remonitor was not adequately considered in the cost of the rule.  Keep in mind that natural gas (largely methane) is the product these companies are producing; therefore, they don&#39;t want it to vent to atmosphere.  That is lost revenue for the producers. The recordkeeping burden on this monitoring is also monumental.  While the very large producers could potentially absorb the cost of added staff, the small producers can not.    <br/><br/>Additionally, PEs don&#39;t want to sign the closed vent system plans since there are so many questions on the design side and this risks a PE license.  You have an unknown product coming out of the ground, at an unknown pressure and an unknown temperature.  Yes, you have reservoir information but that is not definitive of what will happen with any one well. <br/>This is how a dry hole gets drilled and how you can design based off one set of parameters and end up with completely different parameters.  You also have an issue of signing off on the design of a system prior to the construction of a well and the PE is held to what they certified even though well operations will change over the years.  This can be from the line pressure changes for produced gas, the switch to plunger lift from gas lift, etc.",

Currently, there is no clear-cut path manufacturers can navigate to gain market approval. The costs associated with this process are, for the vast majority of vapor manufacturers, an insurmountable hurdle. As a result, 99% of the vapor industry will be shut down in less than two years unless compliance deadlines are extended and the application process is defined.<br/><br/>The FDA took seven years to finalize the deeming regulation that brought vapor products under the agency&#39;s authority to regulate tobacco. Yet, when the rule was finalized, manufacturers were only given two years to comply. At a minimum, the current compliance period ignores the amount of time required to perform the studies FDA has indicated it may require in order to grant market approval for a product.<br/><br/>Having a diverse range of vapor products on the market is critical in order to achieve the public health goal of helping smokers move away from smoking combusted cigarettes and toward low-risk alternatives. Several recent studies demonstrate that the variety of e-cigarette flavors and devices plays a vital role in helping people transition to a smoke-free nicotine product and improve their health. Access to a diverse market of low-risk tobacco and nicotine products must be preserved in order to maximize the public health benefit. If left unchanged, the application of existing tobacco regulations will whittle the vapor market down to only a few expensive products that will be out of reach for many smokers.<br/><br/>I urge the Commissioner to consider the full weight of this petition and accept the petitioner&#39;s request for final guidance and to extend the compliance deadline.
