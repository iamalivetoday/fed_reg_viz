On January 23, 2017, APHIS withdrew the 2017 HPA final rule from publication without undertaking notice and comment procedures, in accordance with a memorandum that was issued by the Executive Office of the President on January 20, 2017.  However, following a lawsuit, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found this withdrawal to be deficient.  The District Court has indicated that one way to remedy this deficiency is to undertake notice and comment procedures on the proposed withdrawal.  APHIS is therefore proposing to withdraw the 2017 HPA final rule, and take public comment on this matter.  Comments on the withdrawal are due no later than August 21, 2023."

As a condition of entry, lemons from northwest Argentina would have to be produced in accordance with a systems approach that would include requirements for importation in commercial consignments; registration and monitoring of places of production and packinghouses; pest-free places of production; grove sanitation, monitoring, and pest control practices; treatment with a surface disinfectant; lot identification; and inspection for quarantine pests by the Argentine national plant protection organization.  Additionally, lemons from northwest Argentina would have to be harvested green and within a certain time period, or treated for Medfly in accordance with an approved treatment schedule.  Lemons from northwest Argentina would also be required to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate with an additional declaration stating that the lemons have been inspected and found to be free of quarantine pests and were produced in accordance with the proposed requirements.  This action would allow for the importation of lemons from northwest Argentina into the United States while continuing to provide protection against the introduction of quarantine pests."

As set forth in section 1021\nof the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau\u2019s purpose is to implement and, where\napplicable, enforce Federal consumer financial law consistently for the\npurpose of ensuring that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services and that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive. In discharging this obligation, the CFPB seeks feedback on practices and products that are related to but may not be addressed in the Bureau\u2019s concurrently published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Payday,\nVehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans (Concurrent\nProposal). Specifically, in this Request for Information (RFI), the Bureau seeks comment on: Potential consumer protection concerns with loans that fall outside the scope of the Bureau\u2019s Concurrent Proposal but are designed to serve similar populations and needs as those loans covered by the proposal; and business practices concerning loans falling within the Bureau\u2019s Concurrent Proposal\u2019s coverage that raise potential consumer protection concerns that are not addressed by the Concurrent\nProposal. The Bureau seeks comment from the public about these consumer lending practices to increase the Bureau\u2019s understanding of and support for potential future efforts, including but not limited to future rulemakings, supervision, enforcement, or consumer education initiatives. Where the Bureau requests evidence, data, or other information regarding a particularly concern about consumer protections, the Bureau does not seek information that directly identifies an individual consumer."

    "docAbstract": "Pursuant to sections 1031 and 1032 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) (Dodd-Frank Act), the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is proposing to establish 12 CFR part 1041, which would contain regulations creating consumer protections for certain consumer credit products. The proposal generally would cover two categories of loans. First, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term of 45 days or less or loans with multiple advances if each advance is required to be repaid within 45 days. Second, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term greater than 45 days, provided that they (1) have an all-in annual percentage rate greater than 36 percent; and (2) either are repaid directly from the consumer\u2019s account or income or are secured by the consumer\u2019s vehicle. For both categories of covered loans, the proposal would identify it as an abusive and unfair practice for a lender to make a covered loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal generally would require that, before making a covered loan, a lender must reasonably determine that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal also would impose certain restrictions on making covered loans when a consumer has or recently had certain an outstanding covered loan. The proposal would provide lenders with options to make covered loans without satisfying the ability-to-repay requirements, if those loans meet certain conditions. The proposal also would identify it as an unfair and abusive practice to attempt to withdraw payment from a consumer\u2019s account for a\ncovered loan after two consecutive payment attempts have failed. The proposal would require lenders to provide certain notices to the consumer before attempting to withdraw payment for a\ncovered loan from the consumer\u2019s account. The Bureau is also proposing to adopt official interpretations to the proposed regulation."

My easy explanation is that endoscopic spine surgery is very difficult to learn. If there is a herniation in the back, it is much easier to find it and remove it with a large incision and big opening than to do it through a straw size tube. Shooting a basketball is much easier than putting a golf ball. <br/><br/>As for physician&#39;s work for spinal nerve decompression, endoscopic spine surgeons do the endoscopic spine surgery identically as other surgeons do with microscope and large tubular retractors. Therefore, I support to use the same RVUs for tubular microscope assisted surgeries to endoscopic spine surgeries, if not more. For endoscopic lumbar discectomy, RVU should be 13.18 (63030), lumbar laminectomy 15.37 (63047), and posterior cervical foraminotomy 16.20 (63020).<br/>",

At minimum, the organization must conduct initial assessment within 90 days of enrollment and must conduct annual reassessment within one year of the initial assessment.&quot;<br/><br/>The CFR reflects the following:<br/><br/>422.112(b)(4)(i)<br/>&quot;The MA organization makes a &quot;best-effort&quot; attempt to conduct an initial assessment of each enrollee&#39;s health care needs, including following up on unsuccessful attempts to contact an enrollee, within 90 days of the effective date of enrollment&quot;<br/><br/>Per the 2016 Final Call Letter, &quot;SNPs are required to perform a comprehensive initial HRA that includes assessment of each enrollee&#39;s physical, psychosocial, and functional needs within the first 90 days of enrollment and conduct reassessments annually thereafter&quot;. <br/><br/>Furthermore, in the 2016 Final Call Letter (page 90 of 190), CMS addressed concerns raised that related to the SNP Care Management measure. In that Call Letter, CMS indicated &quot;During 2014 CMS issued a clarification to this measure to make it explicit that the initial Health Risk Assessment (HRA) must occur on or after the date of the member&#39;s initial enrollment in the plan. That is, the initial HRA must occur when members are already eligible to receive benefits. The reasoning behind this requirement is that in its absence, plans could base enrollment decisions on the results of the HRA. This is not the purpose of the HRA.&quot;<br/><br/>I haven&#39;t come across anything other than the protocol that indicates the HRA may be conducted 90 days before the enrollment effective date.

    "text": "1. I suggest assigning highest priority to the intrinsic social and emotional needs of the species in question. For example, Is the species classified as endangered or threatened?<br/><br/>2. No animal that is threatened, endangered or has been on such a list is suitable for public contact.<br/>Any animal that has ever struck out against a human being should ever again be permitted to have contact with the public.<br/><br/>3. The current system of managing elephant health, particularly zoonotic diseases, fails to protect the public. USDA/ APHIS has a responsibility to monitor transmittable diseases such as Tuberculosis since dangerous animals cross state and county lines where the rules vary and enforcement of safe practices becomes nearly impossible. With technology as it is today, all medical records of all animals that come into contact with the public need to be made readily accessible online without the burden of filing a FOIA.<br/><br/>5. Where elephants are concerned, training and humane treatment are entirely incompatible. To be trained, an elephant is removed from the very life it is wired to live, the life that allows the entire species to survive.<br/><br/>6. Where elephants are concerned, there is no age where weaning is appropriate as in their natural environment the baby elephant alone makes that determination. To &quot;wean&quot; a baby elephant goes against the behaviors the species itself depends on for survival.<br/><br/>7. For elephants, there are multiple successful sanctuary models that function with consideration for the animal&#39;s needs first. Save Elephant Foundation, Chiang Mai, Thailand, Wildlife SOS, India, The Elephant Sanctuary, Tennessee, US, Performing Animals Welfare Society, California, US, are but a few of those organizations that are well-established in operating care facilities for elephants. The standards these organizations set for care and handling elephants is far superior to what the USDA currently permits. APHIS regulations desperately need updating in this area.<br/><br/>8. Elephants should not be involved with public contact at all. The potential for accidents is too great. The history of accidents and exposure to illness is undeniable. The suffering imposed on elephants in order to make contact possible is inhumane. There is no safe and humane way to contain elephants.",

    "text": "I do not support public contact of Big Cats, Bears, and Nonhuman Primates. Domestic animals are the only animals suitable for public contact to ensure safety and control of the animal in all situations. Domestic and farm species (goats, cows, pigs, dogs, cats, etc.) are highly predictable and have been companion animals for thousands of years, unlike these wild and apex predators. Allowing public contact with wild and undomesticated animals presents a danger to both the individual and the community at large.<br/><br/>No matter the age or size, exotic wild animals and apex predators (including hybrids and smaller cat species such as Servals and Bobcats) should always be considered dangerous animals under APHIS. The deplorable conditions and malpractices (exploited, abused, malnourished, and/or deprived of both adequate veterinary care and developmental growth) most of these animals are exposed to in captivity, as well as their significant lack of predictability, creates a higher risk of disease, injury and death for all who have public contact with these animals. It is important to remember that even hand-raised cubs are not tame - their wild instincts will kick in as they mature. Domestication of house cats and dogs took thousands of years. We should remember also that the purpose of the Animal Welfare Act is first and foremost to protect animals and public safety.<br/><br/>Any animal that belongs in the wild poses a public health risk in captivity. Beyond physical harm, mauling and death, - Big Cats, Bears, and Nonhuman Primates are known carriers of human transferable diseases including ring worm, rabies, herpes B, monkey pox, and salmonellosis, to name a few.<br/><br/>Public contact with Big Cats, Bears, and Nonhuman Primates, regardless of age, poses serious health risks and psychological stress to individual animals. Animals used in public contact opportunities are often over-handled and over worked, constantly transported, and are subject to physical alterations such as defanging and declawing. These procedures are inherently cruel and cause severe pain and long term health issues for the individual animal. Young Big Cats, Bears, and Nonhuman Primates are particularly vulnerable when used in public contact opportunities. These animals are stripped from their mothers - causing weakened immune systems and malnutrition. Allowing public contact with exotic animals - especially these young animals - also ignites an unrealistic and irresponsible representation of how inherently dangerous these animals can be, creating a false narrative that these apex predators can be kept as pets.<br/><br/>As a member of Lions, Tigers and Bears, an accredited sanctuary in Alpine, California who rescues and gives such animals a forever home, I&#39;ve seen the effect of the deplorable conditions some of the animals lived in when used for public contact/entertainment.  For example, the two grizzly bears (rescued from the Cherokee Bear park in North Carolina) who now call Lions, Tigers and Bears home are severely undersized and Albert suffers from neurological damage and a limp due to cramped confinement and malnutrition as a cub.  As humans, we should NEVER nor should we allow animals to be treated this way.<br/><br/>These animals do not have a voice.  We need to be their voice and stop the suffering! ",

The restrictions on gay men are ridiculous to me, because over the years, I have had sex with men who claim to be straight... Men who are married to women and have children. And yet they can donate blood by stating they are straight. These men are in denial to themselves and I&#39;m sure when they go to donate they don&#39;t say they&#39;ve had sex with other men. I can&#39;t tell you how many thousands, millions of times this has happened. Another recent example is the National Republican Convention where the gay escort services in Cleveland were the only businesses that thrived. I&#39;m sure most of these men claim to be straight, and yet pay for a male escort. This is very disturbing to me because as I said, these men are out there. I know from first hand experience. And since the FDA tests all the blood for donations, it is really ridiculous for you not to take my blood. There are also many straight people, men and women, who are HIV+, but the FDA screens for diseases. Please get rid of this ban completely. It doesn&#39;t make any sense. And you would open yourself up to many more donations in the process.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>",

    "text": "The updated policy to a one year deferral is intended to align the policy with other regulations that address unsafe behaviors that may be harmful to the blood supply. However, because most individuals identifying as gay or bisexual would also be categorized as MSM, the policy flags specific sexual orientations as being more at risk rather than looking at underlying sexual behaviors contributing to the contraction of HIV. Those other behaviors for being deferred (such as needle usage or money for sex) are not as closely linked to an identity group, resulting in this one year deferral still being discriminatory in nature.<br/><br/>Many other countries have recently changed their policies to align the MSM deferral with other one year behaviorally based deferral periods. Canada has reduced its lifetime ban to a five year deferral period, China has lifted its ban on lesbian women and celibate gay men, and United Kingdom, Sweden, Japan, and Australia have all adopted one year deferral periods for MSM (Cahill, Schaefer, and Guidry 2010). A study conducted in Australia concluded that since the time of this policy change in 2000, there has been no increase in the risk of HIV for blood recipients (Seed 2010, 2722-2730). Although many countries have changed their policies to align with this one year deferral period, many others have moved to individual risk assessment, which should be an updated goal for the United States. Spain, Italy, Poland, and Russia have all moved to this type of system, where &quot;Deferrals are now based on time period following the change of sexual partner, and assessment of risky sexual behavior - regardless of orientation&quot; (Wilson, Atkinson, Keelan 2014).<br/><br/>An effective policy change would address the underlying risk factors for contracting HIV independent of the gender or sexual orientation of the potential donor. The CDC reports that 1 in 3 new cases of HIV in the United States are a result of heterosexual transmission, so there is still a purpose for screening all donors. Not only would this eliminate discrimination of sexual identity from the blood donation process, but it would allow for an overall safer blood supply. Questions to include in an individual risk assessment would involve condom usage, safe sex practices, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and the presence of new sexual partners in the last few months (specifically within the window period of HIV transmission). By asking these questions of every potential donor, it would assure that every blood donation is at a low risk of being HIV positive regardless of the donor&#39;s sexual orientation or gender identity. The window period of HIV has been reduced due to updated scientific testing methods, and since every blood donation is tested for HIV, there is no need to screen out even more donors. Although these questions are seemingly invasive, potential donors should be likely to answer these questions in the privacy of a health history station with a health care professional, knowing that they could be eligible to donate without providing their sexual orientation.<br/><br/>Additionally, with the policy change as a one year deferral period, it is estimated that the United States would receive 89,000 pints of blood donations from eligible MSM donors, as compared to 219,000 additional pints if the entire policy were to be removed (Goldberg &amp; Gates 2011). When considering blood shortages that have existed in the United States over the last decade, this amount of blood would be extremely helpful in hospital systems across the country. There are individuals who are willing to donate blood when it is desperately needed, including during the recent night club shootings in Orlando, or in other areas of Florida due to the temporary ban in Miami regarding Zika virus; yet the current policy prevents these donations from being collected to save lives.<br/><br/>There is no simple solution for how to change the policy, but the U.S. can look at examples from other countries to see what is the most effective. An individual risk assessment of sexual behaviors, as seen in Spain or Italy, is a successful direction to take because it disconnects sexual behavior from a certain sexual identity, which simultaneously increases the safety of the overall blood supply. The ultimate goal should be balancing equality for potential donors and the safety blood supply to save more lives.",

Blood donation by any individual should be based on an individual risk assessment. This discriminatory policy continues that stigma the homosexual men are irresponsible when it comes to safer sex practices and discredits the fact that homosexual couples can be in a long term monogamous partnership/marriage/domestic partnership.  Individuals committed to ongoing blood donation are either required to lie about their sexual practices or have abstained from sex for at least a year.  I believe there would be general public outcry if this was done to heterosexual individuals.  I also know of many heterosexual individuals who will not donate blood because of these discriminatory policies.  We need to think about the greater good to the community and our ability to save the life of someone following a traumatic event or while they are hospitalized.  Making decisions based on consensual sexual practices is outdated, stigmatizing, and continues to promulgate the stereotype that homosexuals are irresponsible disease (HIV) vectors.

These are marine habitat opportunities that occur when oil &amp; gas platforms within the sanctuary&#39;s boundaries are decommissioned.  It appears that the NMS wants to manage &quot;more&quot;, but not &quot;all&quot; of the important marine environments within their boundaries.

    "text": "As the First Selectman of Old Lyme and Chairman of the Lower Connecticut River Valley Metropolitan Planning Organization, I am expressing my deep concerns about the proposed rule and request its withdrawal due to the negative impact it would have on our region. With a similar goal of improving efficiency as is laid out in the proposed rule, our MPO was formed through a voluntary merger under existing USDOT rules and was finalized just two years ago. With this combined planning area, we have been working as a region to further transportation, land use, resilience, and economic development planning in an integrated manner. After two years as a merged MPO, our organization is functioning as &quot;we&quot; rather than &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;, to the credit of all the members and staff. The proposed rule would undo this merger, wasting the $1.7 million in staff time and direct costs, as well as a substantial amount of board member time dedicated to this effort over the course of four years. We would likely have to go through a similar process once more due to this rule change - in half the time and without the grants that made it possible the first time. <br/><br/>The rule change would likely split our region into three separate areas, with each portion having to join a different MPO (and in some cases, multiple MPOs). These separations would ignore defining elements of the regional transportation system, in particular: road and highway networks, transit routes and services, travel patterns (including commuting and freight), and water-based transportation. The municipalities in our current MPO region have similar needs, face the same challenges, and share physical assets like Route 9 and the Connecticut River. We have more in common with our adjacent towns, in terms of transportation planning, than we do with the cities outside of our current region. Should our towns be separated, we are concerned the local needs of our region will not be fully addressed. Determinations of logical planning regions should be left to local elected officials who have extensive knowledge of our areas, rather than handed over to the U.S. Census Bureau and their continually changing &quot;urbanized area&quot; determinations. At a minimum, I request that the comment period on this rule change be extended to 180 days to allow for proper study and comment.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Bonnie A. Reemsnyder<br/>First Selectman, Town of Old Lyme, CT<br/>",

The current system of managing elephant health, particularly zoonotic diseases, fails to protect the public. USDA/ APHIS has a responsibility to monitor transmittable diseases such as Tuberculosis since dangerous animals cross state and county lines where the rules vary and enforcement of safe practices becomes nearly impossible. With technology as it is today, all medical records of all animals that come into contact with the public need to be made readily accessible online without the burden of filing a FOIA.<br/><br/>5. Where elephants are concerned, training and humane treatment are entirely incompatible. To be trained, an elephant is removed from the very life it is wired to live, the life that allows the entire species to survive.<br/><br/>6. Where elephants are concerned, there is no age where weaning is appropriate as in their natural environment the baby elephant alone makes that determination. To &quot;wean&quot; a baby elephant goes against the behaviors the species itself depends on for survival. <br/><br/>7. For elephants, there are multiple successful sanctuary models that function with consideration for the animal&#39;s needs first. Save Elephant Foundation, Chiang Mai, Thailand, Wildlife SOS, India, The Elephant Sanctuary, Tennessee, US, Performing Animals Welfare Society, California, US, are but a few of those organizations that are well-established in operating care facilities for elephants. The standards these organizations set for care and handling elephants is far superior to what the USDA currently permits. APHIS regulations desperately need updating in this area.<br/><br/>8. Elephants should not be involved with public contact at all. The potential for accidents is too great. The history of accidents and exposure to illness is undeniable. The suffering imposed on elephants in order to make contact possible is inhumane. There is no safe and humane way to contain elephants",

In December, he was accepted to his number one college choice - we couldnt be more proud of him. Then this past spring, just weeks before graduating high school, he came out to the world in a way only a modern 18-year old young gay man would - on SnapChat with a picture of himself, his female prom date and a poster declaring his sexual orientation. We are still in awe of his courage, his bravery and his decision to live his life the way he is meant to. <br/><br/>His coming out story was perfect in so many ways. While the positive responses we received from so many warmed my heart deep down to my soul, his school friends accepted the news with a genuine so what? reaction. <br/><br/>Then in June, terror struck in Orlando. The timing was unfortunately both ironic and distressing. Profound sadness replaced some of the joy that had just filled my heart weeks prior. The tragedy truly affected our son. And as our family struggled to come to grips with the horror of the situation, the news coverage also started to shine a light on an injustice of another kind. How did I not know that sexually active gay men were banned from giving blood? Right there on the news, I saw evidence of blatant discrimination against the gay community from our very own government. Why would our sons blood potentially be any different from mine or my husbands or our daughters? How could his blood be rejected simply based on whom he chooses to love?<br/><br/>Giving blood has always been something Ive done. It recent years, Ive learned it actually makes me feel better since I tend to retain iron. I call it a win-win proposition. I&#39;ve always encouraged our children to donate blood as a simple act of giving and they have done so. Realizing that donating blood is something that my son may not be able to do throughout his adult life angers me deeply.<br/><br/>After doing some research, I have learned that the gay blood ban is indeed not based on any scientific factual data but rather founded in a deep-rooted stigma against the LGBTQ community. Every single blood donation is currently screened for HIV and improved testing capabilities are mitigating the risk of viral transmission. <br/><br/>Sexual behavior  not orientation  should be the criteria for a blood donation deferral, plain and simple. Heres an acceptable alternative to the ban proposed by the Columbia Medical Review:<br/><br/>&quot;In lieu of a permanent and categorical ban or the proposed deferral, the FDA should shift to an &#39;Assess and Test&#39; screening system. After assessing the donors personal sexual practices, a deferral may be given only for those in whom a risk of infection has been identified, such as individuals who have engaged in frequent, unprotected sex with multiple partners since their prior HIV test. For this risky group, a short period of abstinence may be appropriate to allow for reliable test results. For donors who are not high risk, the deferral should be eliminated altogether. This model can be applied to both homosexual and heterosexual donors and would not consider monogamous or safe sex to be risky, mirroring the current protocol for straight donors.&quot;<br/><br/>Thank you for officially reconsidering the FDA blood donation policy. End this discriminatory ban once and for all. Send a message to my son that his blood has and always will be no different from anyone elses. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Karen Mason<br/>PO Box 4294<br/>Frisco, CO 80443<br/>",

For both categories of covered loans, the proposal would identify it as an abusive and unfair practice for a lender to make a covered loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal generally would require that, before making a covered loan, a lender must reasonably determine that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal also would impose certain restrictions on making covered loans when a consumer has or recently had certain an outstanding covered loan. The proposal would provide lenders with options to make covered loans without satisfying the ability-to-repay requirements, if those loans meet certain conditions. The proposal also would identify it as an unfair and abusive practice to attempt to withdraw payment from a consumer\u2019s account for a\ncovered loan after two consecutive payment attempts have failed. The proposal would require lenders to provide certain notices to the consumer before attempting to withdraw payment for a\ncovered loan from the consumer\u2019s account. The Bureau is also proposing to adopt official interpretations to the proposed regulation."

    "text": "To FAA and Whom it May Concern,<br/>The airspace changes at Salem McNary Field (KSLE) brought on by NPRM FAA-2014-1069 the subsequent NPRMs FAA-2015-3751 and the current proposal (a-2016-15266) was not justified, discordant and unbefitting of the FAA.  According to FAA rules, policies and procedures, a clear documented process needs to be followed for issuance of any Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPs).  The following orders must be followed to insure the safety of all IFR flights using any TERP.  The issuance of NPRM FAA-2014-1069 basically said that these orders were not followed for all of the approaches and departures to McNary Field (KSLE).  It is unbelievable to me that the E4 extensions at KSLE were removed!  Removing controlled airspace once an approach is issued is complete insanity.<br/>1)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>FAA Order 8260.3C / United States Standard of Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS)<br/>2)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>FAA Order 8200.44A / Flight Inspection Services Instrument Flight Procedure Coordination<br/>3)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>FAA Order 8260.19G / Flight Procedures and Airspace<br/>4)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>FAA Order 8260.26F / Establishing Submission Cutoff Dates for Civil Instrument Flight Procedures<br/>5)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>FAA Order 7400.2K / Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters<br/>Whether or not it will it do any good to comment to the current NPRM is yet to be seen!  Based on the past history it is doubtful that anything I have to say here will have any affect.  I found this particular comment in the final rule to NPRM FAA-2015-3751 to be ironic:<br/>The FAA found that all criteria contained in FAA Order JO 7400.2, Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters; FAA Order JO 8000.369, Safety Management System and the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 501 et seq.) were followed.<br/>If the FAA had followed all the rules, policies and procedures before the issuance of any of the NPRMs for KSLE, I would not be writing this comment!<br/>NPRM FAA-2015-3751 received 71 comments.  Five of those comments stated the E4 extensions needed to be reinstated for air safety.  Yet the FAA failed to agree with or concur with any of the five comments.  I was one of the five commenters that clearly stated the Class E extensions needed to be reinstated; and you, the FAA, chose to not agree or concur.  The comment received by the FAA in Renton on May 10, 2016 was from a meeting I (Charles West) had with you folks from the FAA.  This meeting would not have ever happened had I not made several calls to Washington DC to the office of Elizabeth Ray.  Due to the meeting and the information presented to the following FAA employees - Steve Haga, Richard Roberts, Mindy Wright, Dave Parker and Tracey Johnson, on May 18th - I received an email communication from Mindy Wright agreeing that the approach to runway 13 at KSLE was unprotected at MCCOY intersection.  Subsequently the approach to runway 13 at KSLE was NOTAMd out of service.  That brings us to the current airspace proposal that still does not conform with FAA Order 7400.2K and FAA Order 8260.19G.  It would appear to me that the airspace configuration prior to August 2015 should be reinstated until your proposed change can be flight tested per FAA Order 8200.44A.<br/>If the airspace is not returned to what it was prior to August 2015 indicates the FAA Flight Procedures Department failed in its responsibilities to fill out FAA form 8260-9 properly.  Compliance with the requirements specified in Form 8260-9 (Standard Instrument Approach Procedure Data Record) is required prior to any issuance or publication of any procedure for public use.  <br/>The issuance of NPRM FAA-2014-3751 also said in an indirect fashion that FAA Order 8260.19G section 4-5-2 Roles and responsibilities (paragraph a) The Service Center Operations Support Group (OSG) must: procedures where not followed with the issuance of the TERPs for KSLE.<br/>Addressing the Class D area at KSLE:<br/>Several documents in my possession show that the rising terrain formula from order 7400.2K page 17-2-4 was used to design the current Class D airspace at KSLE.  The rising terrain should have never been used to redesign the Salem Airspace or to justify a change.  The note on page 17-2-4 of Order 7400.2k states the height of the terrain is not used if departures are prohibited in portions of the basic surface area.  Documentation from a Freedom of Information Act request (FOIA) clearly states that vectoring of aircraft to the west cannot happen until the aircraft has reached 1500 feet MSL based on FAA Order 7110.65 paragraph 5-6-3.  That information was in an email sent August 28, 2015 at 10:25 AM from Eric Tandberg to Steve Haga and Leon Fullner.  Additionally, Steve Haga indicated in an email sent September 8, 2015 at 1:00PM to 7 FAA employees and the Salem Tower Manager, he understood departures to the west of the 330/150 line are prohibited until reaching 1,500 feet MSL.<br/>Please refer to attached file for complete statement to the NPRM.<br/><br/>Charles West",

We employ 2 individuals.  I am submitting these comments in opposition to the CFPB&#39;s proposed rule that would prohibit the use of arbitration agreements that contain a class action waiver.  <br/>Arbitration is a faster, less expensive, and more effective means of resolving consumer disputes than class action lawsuits.  Consumers that receive an award in arbitration almost always receive more in arbitration than they would in a class action lawsuit.  This is especially true in disputes involving automobile dealers.  The CFPB acknowledged that consumers in large dollar disputes receive an average recovery of 57 cents on the dollar in arbitration as opposed to pennies on the dollar when consumes participate in class action lawsuits.  The primary beneficiary in class action litigation is not consumers, but the trial lawyers pursuing those claims.    <br/><br/>The CFPB&#39;s proposal treats arbitration agreements in all consumer financial products the same.  Likewise, the CFPB&#39;s proposal treats arbitration agreements for all companies regardless of size the same.  The CFPB makes no distinction between the largest bank and the smallest auto finance company whether the bank is offering a credit card through an online application or a buy here pay here dealer is selling a vehicle to a consumer face to face.  <br/><br/>In treating all companies and all financial products the same, the CFPB is making assumptions that the disclosure of arbitration agreements is the same for each of those entities in very different financial products.  It appears that the CFPB operates from the premise that arbitration agreements in automotive financing are buried in the fine print on the back of a lengthy contract that consumers cannot easily find.  <br/><br/>Generally, automobile dealers that elect to use an arbitration agreement in their sales and financing process provide the consumers with a separate document that contains nothing but the terms of the arbitration agreement.  The font is large enough to be readable and understandable.  This separate document contains a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the consumer is giving up certain rights (such as the right to participate in a class action) and has a signature line that the consumer is required to sign specifically agreeing to those terms.  <br/><br/>By providing a separate arbitration document, dealers are being open and transparent of what the consumer is agreeing to with respect to arbitration.  Presumably, the CFPB exists to ensure transparency in the marketplace.  Rather than drive arbitration out of the marketplace, perhaps the CFPB should consider a rule that recognizes the benefits of arbitration but ensures that a transparent process is in place for the consumer when agreeing to pre-dispute arbitration.  <br/><br/>If the proposed rule moves forward, the costs to my business if compelled to defend class actions, particularly meritless suits, could impose an insurmountable financial burden on my company.  Ultimately, the costs that my company would have to bear will be passed on to consumers.  In the case of customers of buy here pay here dealers who may be credit challenged, the increased costs of a motor vehicle and the associated costs of credit associated with the financing of that vehicle may ultimately prove to be too much for them.  Where does that customer then turn for financing to purchase a motor vehicle?  <br/><br/>The proposed rule to ban class action waivers is a poor policy choice that will ultimately hurt consumers, small businesses, and benefit only the trial lawyers.  The CFPB should withdraw the proposed rule and reexamine the use of arbitration from all perspectives.  The CFPB should more fully understand and include in its study a discussion of how pre-dispute arbitration agreements are disclosed in various consumer financial products.    <br/><br/>I hope that the CFPB will engage in substantive discussions with interested parties from the automotive finance industry and other financial sectors on meaningful solutions that address the CFPB&#39;s concerns with pre-dispute arbitration while recognizing the legitimate benefits of arbitration on both consumers and businesses.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Natasa Smiljanic, Cars Ways.Inc<br/>",

First, the proposed rule would prohibit covered providers of certain consumer financial products and services from using an agreement with a consumer that provides  for arbitration of any future dispute between the parties  to bar the consumer from filing or participating in a class action with respect to the  covered consumer financial product or service.

As set forth in section 1021\nof the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau\u2019s purpose is to implement and, where\napplicable, enforce Federal consumer financial law consistently for the\npurpose of ensuring that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services and that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive. In discharging this obligation, the CFPB seeks feedback on practices and products that are related to but may not be addressed in the Bureau\u2019s concurrently published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Payday,\nVehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans (Concurrent\nProposal). Specifically, in this Request for Information (RFI), the Bureau seeks comment on: Potential consumer protection concerns with loans that fall outside the scope of the Bureau\u2019s Concurrent Proposal but are designed to serve similar populations and needs as those loans covered by the proposal; and business practices concerning loans falling within the Bureau\u2019s Concurrent Proposal\u2019s coverage that raise potential consumer protection concerns that are not addressed by the Concurrent\nProposal. The Bureau seeks comment from the public about these consumer lending practices to increase the Bureau\u2019s understanding of and support for potential future efforts, including but not limited to future rulemakings, supervision, enforcement, or consumer education initiatives. Where the Bureau requests evidence, data, or other information regarding a particularly concern about consumer protections, the Bureau does not seek information that directly identifies an individual consumer."
