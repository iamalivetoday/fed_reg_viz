    "text": "I am strongly in support of the measure to end non-compete clauses. As a physician, I believe particularly this measure could benefit healthcare to combat provider burnout and encourage acceptable working conditions and wages. These effects would extend to patients through choice of willing provider and care from systems that embrace and facilitate innovation. In my field of radiology, there is no particular benefit to a non-compete - patients don&rsquo;t typically pick their radiologists, so there is no &ldquo;patient to poach.&rdquo; Non-competes exist solely to maintain a workforce and restrict competition from other practices.<br/><br/>Many of the comments submitted opposing the proposed rule cite concern for impact on small businesses. Preferentially supporting the rights and wellbeing of small business owners over the rights of workers is unsurprising. These small businesses will be able to maintain employees if they pay wages the employees find appropriate and maintain a satisfactory workplace. Employees should not be held to a job with poor wages or conditions simply because their employer has negotiating power to legally prevent them from leaving without geographical upheaval or prolonged unemployment. Furthermore, eliminating non-competes would allow workers to further local ties and invest in their communities, rather than force them to either leave their communities for a better job or be shackled to a job with subpar wages or conditions. Those arguing that workers may &ldquo;vote with their feet&rdquo; by moving only to states without these restrictive covenants may be forgetting that moving this way may be impossible due to cost or burden workers by separating them from friends, family, schools, and other community.<br/><br/>For those concerned about employees leaving with proprietary information and trade secrets, these could still be protected by NDAs without infringing on an employees freedom to select employment.<br/><br/>For those concerned about federal overreach: these agreements frequently extend beyond state boundaries, prompt interstate movement, affect corporations with a national presence who engage in interstate commerce, and pertain to federal tax. It is within the Federal Trade Commission&rsquo;s purview to regulation these matters.<br/><br/>Regarding businesses that invest in specialty training for employees: these employees should also have freedom in their selection of job. There is an understandable investment and value to training employees. Instead of restricting labor mobility, businesses should consider alternatives such as training fees that are waived provided the employee remains under contract, but would become due if the contract is ended prior to a reasonable period of employment needed to recoup the investment. Alternately, this investment could be protected through deferred employee compensation invested within the company, providing incentives for the employee to stay and work to optimize profits.",

What&#39;s more, it also prevents people from using their knowledge while it is still relevant to advance discoveries in their field. <br/><br/>Non-competes are just one more mechanism that enriches the upper level managers at companies at the expense of most of the company&#39;s workforce.

    "text": "I&#39;m an Optometrist based out of Amarillo, Texas. I worked at a local 2-doctor clinic for five years from 7/2017-7/2022. I decided to leave this office due to shady owners and a poor work environment, but, I had a non-compete clause for 1 year spanning 15miles from the zip-code the office was in. 15 miles from that zip code covers the entirety of Amarillo so if I left I would have to travel for work for an entire year. I ended up accepting an offer across town that serves a completely different type of demographic with a start date beginning after the non-compete period is finished. I&#39;m 6 months through the non-compete and I&#39;ve had to drive 2 hours to work in Lubbock a couple days out of the week to be able to afford student loan payments. Meanwhile the previous practice only has to pay 1 doctor&#39;s salary and is booked out several weeks ahead because there are only so many places that accept medicaid. My new practice does not take medicaid. This non-compete period has been entirely unnecessary and had caused my family and I all sorts of undue stress. I made my old employer a lot of money and they&#39;re still profiting off of the large volume of patients I took care of while I was there. There was no intensive investment they made in me besides credentialing in the very beginning. Employees should be able leave poor workplace conditions without having to travel out of town to make ends meet. In parts of the country a 15mile non-compete can really mean the closest demand for certain types of work can be 125 miles away, as in my situation.",

Originally non-competes were used for top level executives to prevent them from going to work for the competition and using information they had gained in their previous work for a competitor.  These were high-ranking employees or contractors who could survive a year of non-competition by doing other work.  I knew someone who managed to do this after he left a high level position. But I was talking to a worker in a chain sandwich shop one evening a few years ago and we asked her about the  non-competes and found out the workers in their shop were subject to them.  That is outrageous.  It keeps low wage workers from moving to other jobs that pay better or have better benefits.  Even for the higher wage workers like my friend, a non-disclosure of information can be equally effective to a non-compete.  I support this proposed rule.",

If and when she is employed as a cook in this area, is it very possible that at some point, for different reasons, she will decide to seek a different restaurant to cook for. If that new restaurant charges her with violating the competition agreement, she could be out on the streets again. Any rules that would permit charges like this to be filed against her must be struck down now. Thank you in advance for your help. Oh, I forgot to mention that she has two strikes against her because of racism: different original language and country of origin. ",

    "text": "I am writing to explain how matter number P201200 would destroy the staffing industry in the United States. There are more than 25,000 staffing firms in the USA, most of which are small businesses, employing nearly 16 million Americans each year in every industry. The US staffing industry is valued at over $250 Billion a year and requires the existence of non-compete clauses. The proposed elimination of non-competes would gut the industry, put millions of American&rsquo;s out of work, and create a &ldquo;race to the bottom&rdquo; for margins, ultimately eliminating many of the benefits and perks we are able to offer our workers.In our specific niche, SAP staffing and recruiting, we employ thousands of contract workers who support corporate clients with mission critical projects in supply chain optimization, financial and regulatory compliance, and a host of other functions. SAP software is behind 70% of the world&rsquo;s transactions and workers are in very short supply. It takes years for companies like ours to develop clients and each client has a lifecycle of just a few years. If this proposed change goes into effect without an exemption for the staffing industry, we would face the very real prospect of non-US based companies undercutting our margins after we&rsquo;ve invested the time and capital to develop a client. This would lead to turmoil in the SAP market, would impact the delivery of these mission critical projects, disrupt supply chains, cause FDA, FERC, and SOX compliance to quickly degrade, and could cause global economic disruption. Sure, a worker from McDonald&rsquo;s should be able to get a job for a bit more money across the street at Burger King, but disrupting the staffing industry would create economic hardship for many more Americans than this rule change attempts to correct. I strongly urge you to speak with staffing industry professionals to better understand the impact on this proposed change.&nbsp;",

The anesthesia job market in Denver for the last 7 years has been dominated by a national group which has coerced most of the Hospital systems into entering exclusive arrangements for anesthesia services, essentially shutting out any competition. Any physicians employed by this national entity were required to agree to a noncompete clause in their contract. Now, with the national shortage of anesthesiologists, the hospitals are struggling to find  physicians that are not restricted by this noncompete clause to provide anesthesia services for their patients. This is creating hardships for patients, hospitals, and providers alike and thus is not in the best interest of the community and the public at large.

Due to this, I am forced to take a job outside of the field that I not only love but all my skills pertain to at least for one year because of this contract. My family also feels scared that even after one year, what is stopping the company from suing us or giving us a hard time if I were to work for competitor? My family and I feel trapped by this because all we want is a fresh start and still maintaining a great relationship with the company. With limited jobs available, we may be forced to sell our house, relocate for a year, and take a major hit in salary having a job that is not what I am best at. This has been a major road block for my career to grow.

I have lost many of the specialists I refer to and who would see my uninsured, under insured and financially poor patients at little or no cost to them. Why has this happen you might ask. The specialists were forced to join hospital systems, to become employed physicians, in order to maintain their ability to do procedures in that hospital. If they did not join the hospital system such ability would be revoked, limited, or restricted in other ways. Their contracts then included such non-compete clauses, which of course were glossed over by the hospital systems. Some time later the hospital system then required unacceptable and very questionable requirements on the specialty physician, the physician was forced to leave the community because she/he would not comply with imposed and inappropriate hospital system rules; because the hospital system invoked the non-compete clause. Therefore; I lost the ability to ask/sent my patient in need of specialty care, to such specialists and the patients lost their ability to access quality care in a timely manner. The entire system of access to quality and needed care is compromised by the existence of hospital systems to invoke such clauses on physicians. My kind specialty physicians willing to see patients in need  from the Free Clinic suffered. My patients suffered from lack of access to the medical care they needed. I would think the FTC is getting push back from the lawyers from hospital systems large and small to allow them to continue this rule. However there are real patient care consequences to the control that hospital systems place on physicians. I hope the FTC sides with patients and patient needs, and not the hospital systems, and eliminate the ability to impose non-compete clause rules. <br/><br/>James A.

    "text": "I am strongly in favor of the rule that would ban non-compete clauses in employment contracts. The state of Florida is known for being extremely favorable to employers after state level legislation was implemented in 2018. The employers in the industry of my employment over the last 12 years has been using these agreements to threaten and intimidate workers after laws became more favorable to them. Many of the clauses I have personally seen are overreaching. For example, this industry is a niche of construction but they have banned workers from working in any area of construction, whether or not the company of employment even performs the service. While many of the terms of these agreements are not enforceable in court, the goal of these employers is to scare the employees with very costly lawsuits and it is usually effective. There are additional contractual terms that can protect these employers from losing the cost of specialized training or prevent employees from leaving and taking clients and other employees to competitors. Non-solicitations are also added to the non-compete agreement and are usually quite fair. The term where employees may not work for any company the employer defines as a competitor perpetuate unfavorable working conditions to the employees. I have personally experienced or been witness to sexual harassment, verbal abuse, physical abuse, and extremely unsafe working conditions made possible because people could not leave and utilize their skills without the threat of a lawsuit. These lawsuits can cost what the average worker makes in a year. Please move forward with the ban of the non-compete clauses in employment contracts.",

    "text": "I support the proposed rule to ban employers from imposing non-competes on their employees. I am a veterinary student and we learned about non-competes because they are so prevalent in our industry - I believe about 85% of veterinarians&#39; contracts have them. Veterinarians have some of the lowest income: debt ratios of any profession and adding a non-compete clause to contracts continues to exacerbate that issue. Oftentimes if you want to switch jobs you need to relocate, not just to another neighborhood, but to a completely different city, which can mean relocating your whole family. It also prevents veterinarians from starting their own practices where they live, which is a great way to increase one&#39;s earnings, and increase competition in the area, thereby lowering prices and increasing the quality of veterinary care. Veterinarians are also 2.5x more likely than the average person to commit suicide. I also fully support this proposed rule because it will help give veterinary professionals the freedom in their lives that they need to be successful and happy. ",

    "text": "I am a software engineer in Massachusetts employed by a very large (&gt; 300,000 employees) corporation. About 10 years ago, the company I was working for was purchased by this large corporation and all acquired employees were required to sign a non-compete agreement as terms of the acquisition. I was not offered any compensation for signing the non-compete and I would not have been offered employment with the acquiring company if I did not sign. In this situation, the employer has all the power and the employee has none. In 2018, the Massachusetts adopted a non-compete regulation ( https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXI/Chapter149/Section24L ) but it has serious problems: 1) It did not change any non-compete agreements that were currently in effect, only future non-compete agreements. 2) It requires that the company either offer the employee 50% pay during the non-compete period &quot;or other mutually-agreed upon consideration between the employer and the employee&quot;. The mutually-agreed upon consideration phrase means that the company could offer $1 to the future employee in exchange for signing the non-compete. Even though software engineers are often in demand by employers, I&#39;ve never been in a situation where I could choose between several job offers. The request to sign the non-compete agreement occurs very late in the job negotiation process, often after the salary negotiation is complete and the job has been offered verbally. At that point, it would be very awkward to go through another round of negotiation about what is fair compensation for signing a non-compete agreement. Many job seekers would just sign the non-compete at this point or fear losing out on the job offer. Please ban non-compete agreements. Non-disclosure agreements and client/customer non-solicitation agreements are all that are needed to protect employers.",

Second, it will put further pressure on employers to treat their employees well.

Instead employers will have to treat their employees with better pay, benefits and working conditions.

    "text": "Non-Compete Clause Rulemaking, Matter No. P201200<br/><br/>I would like to share my experience and opinions on non-compete clauses-<br/><br/>I am an artist working in the tech field for a small business and I was given a non-compete to sign at the end of my 3 month probation period. It was never discussed prior to that and was slipped in with the standard NDA stuff that is common in my field of work. The contract was presented to me as though signing it was the last step to my full time employment and I felt the options were to either sign it or become unemployed.<br/><br/>My contract bars me from working for any company that creates products in competition with ours for the entirety of North America. After talking to a lawyer I was told this could stand in court as we are a partially remote company that works with clients all over the world. So I am basically stuck working for this company if I want to stay in this field. My other option would be to work for an international company or shift industries for a year, which seems highly damaging to my career, as tech is constantly changing and evolving. My position specifically demands highly specialized skills and moving to a new field would basically mean starting over for me regardless of if i were to permanently switch or return in a year. This is something I don&#39;t feel I can afford to do.<br/><br/>I was told to expect raises and bonuses, and a negotiation period for a higher wage after the end of my probation period. None of those things have happened and I have been with this company for 1.5 years with a below average salary. I would like to find other employment that will pay me more fairly for my skills and service, but this non compete clause has barred me from doing so. I am also pressured to work well outside of my job title as my contract also classifies me as an at-will worker and I have seen coworkers fired for speaking out and I can not afford to lose my job.<br/><br/>Because I am so heavily involved with one of our clients I would like to make the jump and work for them directly instead (it honestly feels like I already do), and they would pay me significantly more for my skills and services directly, but I am unable to due to the nature of my non-compete. <br/><br/>My employer is also highly disorganized and in my opinion a sinking ship. Many coworkers believe this to be the case, several older employees who didn&#39;t have to sign non-competes already have begun to leave, but the newer batch of workers don&rsquo;t feel safe to jump ship for stable employment because of our contracts. We are also unable to start our own company due to a solicitation clause that is added in barring us from working together outside of our employment. When asked about the addition of the non compete and solicitation clauses, we were told explicitly that previous workers had quit to start their own company and that they didn&#39;t want that to happen again. When talking with previous employees they said working conditions had gotten so bad they were spurred to action and were successful. It&#39;s disheartening because if given the freedom to do so several of us would in fact do just that.<br/><br/>In my opinion I do not believe there should not be exceptions for small businesses. They can be just as predatory. One reason I left my previous position to this new one was because I was told they can not afford to give me a raise because of their small business status. Now at my new job the same attitude has been shared, although this time I am contractually obligated to not find new employment elsewhere in my field. Businesses of all sizes should be able to support and incentivise workers to stay. Using non-compete clauses traps workers into impossible situations, stifles new business from emerging and incentivises businesses to do the bare minimum, dragging their workers, wages, standards and the economy down with them.<br/><br/>I believe non-compete clauses are unfair and limit workers&#39; options for better employment, wages, and benefits. They limit employees&rsquo; ability to leave their current positions to find better opportunities and to start their own businesses. Non-competes are often enforced by employers, who have plenty of resources to go to court, while leaving workers with little resources to fight back. Workers should be able to freely use their skills and knowledge to seek better jobs and wages, without fear of losing their current job or being sued.",

    "text": "I support the proposal for many reasons, most of which are clearly laid out in the notice.  However, I believe that the 910.3 exception is too broad and needs to be narrowed.<br/><br/>First, I think that the concept of sale of a person&#39;s ownership in a business should be broadened to include any liquidity event, such as an IPO or other transaction which allows the owner to monetize his ownership stake at a value in excess of her capital account.<br/><br/>More importantly, the 25% rule is too strict.  For example, this would have exempted all of the Goldman Sachs partners participating in its 1999 IPO.  The reality is that in many mergers and IPOs of partnerships, virtually no partner owns anywhere near 25% of the business.  Yet the sellers often achieve huge windfalls and the buyers have a legitimate interest in preventing the thusly enriched employees from competing against their former employer.  Essentially the non-compete protects the corporate buyer from the selling partner selling his skills, customer relationships, industry knowledge, etc. and yet still retaining these personal assets for additional financial gain.<br/><br/>There are numerous ways to reasonably address this concern without eviscerating the spirit of the proposal.  For example, I think it would be reasonable to broaden the exception to include any employee who receives value in the transaction exceeding the greater of (i) three years&#39; compensation or (ii) two million dollars.  Such value would be calculated as the premium of consideration received in the transaction in excess of the seller&#39;s capital account in the case of private companies, or consideration excluding fully vested equity ownership, stock options and like in the case of publicly traded companies.<br/><br/>Such alterations to 910.3 might seem detrimental to such employees, but I believe the opposite to be true.  Without some form of legitimate protection for their investment, rational purchasers will be loath to acquire virtually any personal service partnership, such as an asset management firm or consulting practice.  So the employee/owners will have no way to monetize the goodwill that they have established through their efforts.  A good many mutually beneficial transactions will not occur, to no one&#39;s benefit.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of these comments.",

These clauses are detrimental to both employees and the economy as a whole.<br/>First, non-compete clauses limit the mobility and career advancement opportunities of employees. They prevent individuals from seeking better job opportunities and earning potential, and can even discourage them from leaving a job they are unhappy with. This can lead to employees feeling trapped in their current roles, resulting in lower job satisfaction and productivity.<br/>Furthermore, non-compete clauses can stifle innovation and competition by preventing employees from bringing their skills and knowledge to new companies and industries. This can slow down the pace of technological and economic progress, and can even lead to a stagnation of ideas and practices.<br/>In light of these negative effects, it is clear that non-compete clauses should be abolished.

Teleconsulting would not lead to competition for the hospital as it would not be with clients and patients, but still prohibited. Most hospitals will challenge non-competes even if they are non-enforceable. It is really about who can afford to take it to court - in the case of most corporations they will win because I do not make enough to challenge it. ",

They have not challenged it because of the time it takes in the legal process.  By the time the case goes to court, the clause has expired or is close to expiring.  In addition, different employers will have different time periods and requirements, and there&#39;s no uniformity with non-competes.  One company banned employees from working for a competitor within a 50-mile radius of any of its locations, and this company had stations across the state of Kansas.  That could require a worker to move out of state to satisfy the non-compete requirement.   It&#39;s about time this practice was banned in the U.S.  This is an employer asking for a hold on a worker beyond the term of employment.  That&#39;s not fair, it&#39;s not right, and it&#39;s not something that an employer should even have the right to ask for in the first place. ",

Our growth, which has doubled employee headcount every 2-3 years, depends upon proprietary processes and principles which depend upon non-compete agreements to be maintained.  <br/><br/>While we also require confidentiality agreements, experience proves that employees hired from competitors often violate their confidentiality obligations to previous employers with impunity.  Indeed, only the most blatant violation of non-disclosure agreements are ever discovered, and then rarely.  A limited non-compete agreement provides a practical firewall which substantially lessens the likelihood that intellectual property rights will be violated.<br/><br/>Our company&#39;s growth also depends upon the retention of existing customers, which we have won and grown at great expense.  Non-compete agreements provide reasonable protection against solicitation of my employees for the sole purpose of &quot;poaching&quot; my customers--not based on competitive performance, but merely on the basis of a relationship with my employee.  When an employee leaves, a reasonable non-compete period allows for a relationship to be developed with another member of my team, preserving the investment my business makes in all of its customers.<br/><br/>In almost 30 years of running similar companies--all with non-compete agreements for all employees--I have had three instances when a former employee&#39;s behavior was so egregious that I enforced their non-competes. During the same time, I have waived many dozens of non-compete provisions when my departing employees wished to work for a similar business that was not directly competitive.<br/><br/>Reasonable rules restricting the application of non-compete agreements to prevent employer abuse can easily be formulated while preserving employers&#39; rights to protect the investments made in intellectual property and customer relationships which are the bedrock of all businesses.  I encourage the Commission to preserve employer rights while reasonably protecting every worker&#39;s right to earn a living.",

Most employers are making people sign contracts that state if they leave they cannot work anywhere else in their field for two years!  Also, if any training is done and you leave before a two year period they make you pay them for training.  That should be illegal since it is part of the job required at that facility.  For example, I had a job at a laser hair removal company.  They told me if I quit before the two year period I would owe them up to $200 for training.  When I started they made me be a front desk assistant.  I stayed for weeks and never actually did the job that I was hired for.  This was a scam to get a secretary and a waste of my time.  If I wasn&#39;t aware of my rights they would have charged me for training that I never received.  I have heard stories where people pay thousands for their school certification, start and a job and then quit for unreasonable work environments.  Afterwards they cannot use their certification because of a contract that was signed.  I cannot find a job in my field because I refuse to sign contracts like this.

    "text": "The FTC&rsquo;s draft rule concerning non-compete agreements serves several important public policy issues. It encourages worker mobility and promotes healthy business competition. It also establishes a sorely needed national standard for noncompete agreements. <br/><br/>In my experience as an former attorney and current business executive, it&rsquo;s clear that some employers demand unfair noncompete agreements from entry-level and mid-level employees. Most employees do not have the same leverage as their employers when it comes to negotiation or litigation of noncompete agreements. A national standard will help curtail employers&rsquo; unfair demands. <br/><br/>With all of that said, the regulation as drafted is overbroad. It discounts legitimate interests that employers must protect. I encourage the Commission to consider the following:  <br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The rulemaking should be limited to non-exempt employees and exempt employees functioning at a middle or junior level (i.e., earning less than a defined amount). There must be a carve-out for highly compensated/executive level employees.  A senior executive has access to a great amount of company information, and the company has a legitimate interest in protecting that information. Consider the following analogy:  The SEC has different rulemaking for accredited vs. non-accredited investors.  The Commission should adopt this mindset and focus its efforts on those employees who are least able to protect themselves and who are compensated at lower levels. <br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The proposed restrictions should not apply to company shareholders above some nominal threshold.  The rulemaking provides an exemption for business owners that hold at least 25% ownership of a business when they sell their companies. 25% is an unreasonably high and arbitrary threshold. The Commission should look at valuation not compensation.  Compare a 1% stake in a $1 billion company to a 25% stake in a $1 million company. If an employee is an equity holder in a business above some nominal valuation threshold, noncompete issues should be resolved outside of this regulation &ndash; both in the ordinary course of business and divestiture contexts.  If a company offers equity to an employee, he/she can always accept or decline. It would be a mistake for the Commission to discourage companies from offering equity to employees. <br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The definition of a de facto non-compete clause is grossly overbroad. It makes no real attempt to allow for employers to fairly protect their interests.  The draft rules define a de facto noncompete as one that &ldquo;has the effect of prohibiting the worker from seeking or accepting employment with a person or operating a business after the conclusion of the worker&#39;s employment with the employer.&rdquo;  By that standard, anything, including a reasonable non solicitation agreement, could be construed as a de-facto noncompete.  <br/><br/>The Commission should consider a narrower definition of &ldquo;de facto noncompete.&rdquo; For example: one that prevents the worker from seeking or accepting employment in their desired city and/or industry &ndash; not necessarily tied to a &ldquo;person&rdquo; (i.e., a particular employer). <br/><br/>The Commission should stipulate that non-solicitation and nondisclosure agreements are outside of the scope of this rule unless they meet a more reasonable standard of a de-facto noncompete. Employers spend tremendous resources building and growing customer relationships and developing knowhow and resources.  Companies have a right to protect those relationships.  The Commission fails to afford sufficient latitude to companies who fairly seek to protect their legitimate interests. <br/><br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Finally, the Commission should determine whether this rulemaking as drafted would disproportionately impact small business.  By denying them reasonable ability to protect their legitimate interests, they become more vulnerable to larger competitors with infinitely greater resources. Tailoring the scope of the regulation as proposed herein will ensure that small businesses are not unfairly impacted. <br/><br/>In sum, this rulemaking would be more palatable if it focused on junior and mid-level employees - those less able to protect themselves.  Non-competes impacting (1) senior executives/highly compensated employees and (2) shareholders should be left to state law.  Nonsolicitation and nondisclosure agreements explicitly should be presumed outside of the scope of the rulemaking unless they meet a more properly tailored definition of &ldquo;de-facto&rdquo; noncompete. <br/>",

    "text": "I strongly support banning these clauses that our hurting our nations workers including myself. I signed a &quot;contract&quot; 10 years ago as a condition of employment for a company that does work for State and Federal Government. I was offered a job (of a different type than what I was doing) with much better pay, health insurance, and other benefits including a pension. I gave notice and took the job. What I received in return from my former employer was a civil lawsuit for &quot;breach of contract&quot;. They initially threatened to sue my new employer as well, however they have only come after me since my new employer most likely has lawyers on retainer just like they do. So much easier for a company to sue the little person. I&#39;ve been dealing with this lawsuit for nearly a year with no end in sight. Said &quot;contract&quot; was written so ambiguously that it would have allowed them to sue even had I left a professional environment to work at a fast food establishment. The power these so called contracts and clauses hold over people, allowing for companies and corporations to make more money off of already overworked, underpaid, under valued employees (most who are average run of the mill people who are not in management or are executives privy to trade secrets) is so completely and utterly unfair when all someone wants is to make a better life for themselves and their families. I implore the FTC to put an end to this practice so all people in the workforce can be given a fair advantage and choice to work and change jobs as they see fit. Fear of being sued by a company or corporation that already has the advantage of money and unlimited access to attorneys at their disposal is most certainly not what we&#39;ve been taught about the &quot;American Dream&quot;.",

    "text": "Dear FTC:<br/><br/>I support the rule to end all do not compete clauses in employment.   I am a Wisconsin physician with over 17 years of experience in my specialty.  The Wisconsin Medical Society, of which I am a member, also opposes do not compete clauses.   Back when I competed my specialty training and sought employment, all my perspective employers required a do not compete clause as a condition of employment. Today, in almost all specialties, all physicians that I am aware of are required to sign these agreements.  I have 13 years of training beyond high school.  Like all the physicians I know, my employer never paid for any of the financial or opportunity cost of my training.  These agreements, commonly referred to as restrictive covenants, seem to be written for the primary purpose to limit the physician&rsquo;s employment opportunities, rather than any real protection of the employer. They are made with broad radius and significant year restrictions.  If a physician desires a new position of employment, physicians either face loosing significant time with their family in long impractical commutes, or face having to leave the community in where they live.   The net effect is if you like where you live, you have to accept the work conditions your employer mandates. Most of the physicians who I have known who left their employer ultimately moved out of their community, many frequently out of state.  Sadly, almost all of them enjoyed the community in which they lived.   More disheartening, some experienced physicians facing the same dilemma chose early retirement.  They gave up practicing medicine rather than move from their home communities.  Their experience cannot easily be replaced.  Their value to their patients now is permanently, prematurely lost.   For most of our new physicians graduating from residency, they face one chance to effectively pick where they want to work in the community of where they want to live.  This is wrong.  <br/><br/>Currently almost all health care companies do not market individual physicians, they market their brand.  Their brand is not affected by which physicians are hired or retained.  Their patient populations also would not be threatened if physicians did not have restrictive covenants.  In addition, most patients now select health care organizations primarily based on who is covered by their insurance.  Patients do not select their insurance based upon which physicians are covered.  Eliminating do not compete clauses will not affect the ability for these organizations to significantly retain their patients.  It will however, significantly affect how they relate to their physicians.  Most physicians I know who left their employer did it because of their work conditions and not their pay.  By giving physicians more freedom in employment, you will increase their voice, decrease physician burn out, and minimize early retirement.  Most importantly with a reduction in physician burn out and early retirement, this will expand physician access and ultimately improve patient care.  <br/>I feel do not compete agreements are wrong in my industry.  I am sure the same situation applies to other industries.  People are more effective working in a job that they want to be at, rather than a job they feel they have to be at.   If an employee becomes valuable to an organization, the solution is not a preemptive limit on their work freedom, but rather to improve their work conditions.  Do not complete agreements need to be eliminated.   Thank you for your courageous stand. <br/>",

    "text": "To Whom It May Concern, <br/>Our studio, Sweet Tea Yoga, was established in 2018 and ran rather successfully, even through a pandemic, until 2021. Previous to owning a studio I was not a business person (I studied music) and believed it went against yogic principles to ask our instructors sign a non-compete. <br/>In 2021 one of our instructors, opened a studio just 3 miles down the road, taking almost half of our monthly unlimited clients with her. I understand this can happen, but it was extremely unfortunate as this person was very deceitful and lied when asked if this was her plan. She did not sign a non-compete. In addition, she is also currently offering unsafe yoga classes, such as having uncertified teachers leading classes in her studio, telling pregnant women it is safe to take hot yoga classes, and offering a Yoga Alliance 200HR YTT when her studio is not even a registered Yoga Alliance School. I believe formal complaints have been made against this instructor, but I digress. Either way, it was a very painful experience, both financially and emotionally. <br/>Since then, we now have a non-compete for our instructors that indicates that they may TEACH anywhere they like, but they WILL NOT OPEN A STUDIO within a 5 mile radius. This is a legally binding document that they sign willingly. Not a single of one our 17 instructors has refused to sign it as many of them also experienced the ugliness and hurt from this episode. <br/>What is to stop each and every yoga teacher from opening their own studio if we do not have non-competes to protect us as business owners? <br/>As a small business owner it is imperative to protect ourselves from experiencing this again. I personally believe teachers benefit from teaching in multiple venues, but there needs to be some level of protection of our client base that takes YEARS to establish. <br/>",

I have also seen comments that this will not apply/be enforced on non-for-profit hospital systems, but as someone with extensive experience in this market, non-for-profit is merely a tax status these systems use and has little to do with how they actually operate.

The current regulations that prohibit non-compete agreements in certain professions do not include physicians, despite the fact that physicians often face similar restrictions on their ability to practice medicine.<br/><br/>Non-compete agreements are designed to prevent employees from leaving their current employer and working for a competing company or starting a competing business. While non-compete agreements can be appropriate in certain circumstances, they can also be overly restrictive and limit job opportunities for workers.<br/><br/>In the case of physicians, non-compete agreements can prevent them from practicing medicine in a certain geographical area or with certain patients for a period of time after leaving their current employer. This can be especially problematic for patients who rely on their physicians for ongoing care, as well as for physicians who may be forced to relocate or give up their medical practice altogether.<br/><br/>I believe that including physicians in the non-compete rule would help to promote competition in the healthcare industry and provide greater job opportunities for physicians. By prohibiting overly restrictive non-compete agreements, physicians would be free to pursue new job opportunities and provide healthcare services to patients without fear of legal consequences.<br/><br/>I appreciate your consideration of this issue and urge you to take action to ensure that physicians are included in the non-compete rule.

These agreements are pervasive within the veterinary community and are often used to intimidate workers from leaving positions, asking for better wages or improved working conditions . Often communities are left with limited veterinary care because an associate veterinarian has been forced to relocate rather than work at another hospital or start their own business. Large corporations now own a majority stake of the veterinary market and can now employ fleets of lawyers to intimidate and pursue veterinarians that attempt to work within a non-compete radius. Non-compete agreements are often written that extend well beyond a reasonable scope in both distance and duration or over-reach into job descriptions that were beyond the employees role within the hospital. As a specialist veterinarian under my current non-compete I am not allowed to work in any scope of veterinary medicine within a 25 mile radius for 2 years. I am facing commuting 1.5 hours (one way)  or completely uprooting my family to find a position at a hospital that is not within my non-compete agreement. I do not posses trade secrets. I am not privy to management meetings or corporate leadership discussions. The sole purpose of the non-compete is to intimidate me from leaving a corporation for a better opportunity or daring to start my own business . ",

    "text": "My name is Bruce Fearon MD. I retooled my career from Family Medicine into  Venous and Lymphatic Medicine 17yrs ago.  I am reaching out to additional physicians to learn about this extremely common medical condition and to learn how to treat these conditions.  Unfortunately, I have to invest in them for 4-6 months teaching them and paying them the entire time before they can function on their own.  There is absolutely no incentive for me to teach anyone anything I know and practice , only to have them move into the neighborhood and compete against me.  I understand that lower paid healthcare services such as Ultrasound techs need to make money to support their family, but high paid individuals over 120K including midlevel providers should not immediately be able to leave and compete given all that I have invested in them.  I believe that a certain amount of time is required to pay back the investment say 2-3yrs or they can buy out their obligation. A physician leaving during their first year would owe 150,000$ , or if it is during their second year say 75,000 and after 3 years there would be no pay back required.  I spent a great deal of money investing in myself , buying and training my personnel, etc. I also think that we should be allowed to add punitive payments for stealing our highly trained personnel to be paid by the physician (not the medical assistants or Vascular techs).  I am certainly willing to help expand the care that I offer and would be even willing to finance and assist in the physicians own efforts to have their own autonomy (kind of like a franchise but with a time expiration (5yrs)) so that they can eventually own and run their own business. To outlaw restrictive covenants on high paid and professional individuals who require advanced additional skills and expert training will severely restrict the growth of my industry and I have to believe the same would happen to many other industries.  If a physician that I train wants to leave early then they will have to move outside my current demographic drawing area.  Each specialty will have maybe some different range of distance. The more specialized you are , the greater the distance.  I would think a basic Family Medicine physician might need to move 20-25miles for 2-3years. In my case, practicing venous and lymphatic medicine I would think 40-50miles would be required (even though I currently draw from 60miles in any direction).  Each industry will have a different argument and a different need so I would restrict this to highly paid individuals; the more narrow a niche --the greater the range might be required.  A tremendous amount of education  and training occurs in the private sector beyond College.  Businesses will slow down their hiring and you will constrict supply chains and the economy with a complete outlawing of Restrictive Covenants.  I recommend you pick a common ground so that you can sell it to both sides of the political party. I have seen some low level employees making under 80,000 who were made to sign a restrictive covenant and I do understand the idea of lifting some of these absurd contract rules- Highly paid employees with key knowledge etc. as I have said are a different matter.

I strongly believe that the vast majority of non-compete clauses are inappropriate, and just a sign of bad management (the exception that I see are for sale of a business, or where there is negotiated severance compensation with a sophisticated employee).  Our job as stewards of the business is to create an environment that our team members want to stay in and support the business and, when they move on, encourage them to further success.  I have seen other firms hire new team members, forcing a non compete clause without explaining how many rights the team member was signing away.  The team member is then effectively stuck in what may be a dis-functional environment and deprived of the ability to earn a decent living in their market for a year or two.  In my mind, it is just wrong in many dimensions.  During the hiring process, the vast majority of employees do not understand the non-compete, or realize that it may be negotiable, employers often soft sell the non compete during the hiring process (trust me), only to take advantage when a valuable employee leaves, you have a very sophisticated entity (the employer), negotiating with and often taking advantage of the unsophisticated.  If you look at the California business environment, I believe the vibrancy of competition has shown that companies can prosper, while having to compete fairly for employees.  We are a very successful company and do not need to rely on non competes to keep our team members.  ",

    "text": "I strongly support the FTC&rsquo;s proposal to federally ban noncompete agreements. For decades, exploitative noncompete agreements have barred workers from pursuing better employment opportunities in the same industry, stifling wages, and preventing career advancement. One in five American workers have signed noncompete agreements &ndash;&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s a problem across industries. From Jiffy Lube mechanics to Amazon warehouse workers, employees across the country are unfairly bound to their jobs by noncompetes. Jimmy John&rsquo;s even tried to use noncompetes to prevent their employers from working at any other establishment that serves sandwiches. Banning noncompete agreements will lead to higher wages and better opportunities for American workers. This would be a critical step toward strengthening the middle and working classes &ndash; ultimately building a stronger economy for everyone. Corporate lobby groups are bitterly opposed to banning noncompete agreements because they want to keep competition for the labor force as low as possible. A ban on abusive and excessive noncompetes would have a huge impact on our economy: Estimates show that banning noncompete agreements could grow paychecks for American workers by nearly $300 billion per year and open up new career opportunities for 30 million people.",

    "text": "As a physician in a major metropolitan area, non-compete clauses are present in many of the contracts available at almost every hospital within a 20 mile radius. Non-competes strangle physicians and other healthcare workers, limiting their bargaining power and preventing them from achieving equity in pay. It is clear why the AHA opposes this rule, this rule is directly in conflict with the profiteering interests of large hospital corporations and its leaders. These corporations profit for many reasons, and minimizing physician compensation is one of the ways they use to line their own pockets. ",

    "text": "I&#39;m a Service manager at a dealership in Minnesota, my employer forced me to sign a noncompete/nondisclosure/nonsolicitation for what was initially 2 years and 100 miles covering service, sales, and parts. Basically the entire auto industry, I managed to get it negotiated down to 1 year but the auto industry is all that&#39;s on my resume, no other auto shops or sales in the area use them by my employer uses them as employee retention claiming we have trade secrets but I have yet to find any reason our shop is run any different from any other auto shop. Under this clause I can&#39;t even go work a minimum wage auto parts store job and I have no other option for employment. Additionally in my pay plan is a clause that allows my employer to change it at will. My position is a high stress high turnover position claiming 5 managers in the last 8 years but I have no other option than this 70k/year position. There&#39;s no reason except using the non compete as an employee retention tool. Minnesota is pretty tough on non compete agreements but they&#39;re still vastly legal and enforceable, and even with my pay affording an attorney to challenge it in court is next to impossible. Non competes for high paying executive jobs can make sense, but people like me on the lower end of the spectrum who aren&#39;t living in lavish conditions are being pinned down and held in place intentionally using these agreements when a simple non disclosure non solicit agreement would protect the buisness just fine.",

She had signed a non-compete clause with The Ohio State University. In order for her to find a job she had to accept a job in Dayton, OH. The drive from Columbus to Dayton is not acceptable daily commute. I quit my job and found a new job in Dayton. I sold my house which I had bought at age 21 and had put in years of renovations into and had a strong sentimental feeling to. We had to move away from nearby friends and family, which we see occasionally on weekends when we drive back to Columbus. We can no longer do weeknight dinners with our friends and family in Columbus. This has been an incredibly stressful move and continues to be a strain on our daily lives all of which could have been avoided had the non-compete not existed.",
