    "text": "February 7, 2017<br/>Stephen Ostroff, M.D.<br/>Acting Commissioner<br/>Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305)<br/>Food and Drug Administration<br/>5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061<br/>Rockville, MD 20852<br/>Re: Docket No. FDA-2016-N-2527Tobacco Product Standard for N-Nitrosonornicotine (NNN) Level in Finished Smokeless Tobacco Products, 82 Fed. Reg. 8,004 (Jan. 23, 2017)<br/><br/>Reducing cancer-producing NNN is the easiest thing I have ever done; Ive done it thousands of times.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Paraphrasing Mark Twain<br/><br/>We already have the prolonged federally unauthorized experimental paradigm and exegesis of light cigarettes, which clearly and convincingly testify to the fact that less nicotine in cigarettes translates into a higher risk for developing nicotine dependence and cancer. Light cigarettes are more zealously drawn upon, more deeply inhaled, retained in the lungs longer, and more often smoked down to the filter; in addition, more light cigarettes are smoked to achieve a comparable but temporary nicotine-induced focused, calm, and wellbeing cognitive result when compared to regular cigarettes, with the corresponding tobacco companies substantially increasing their revenue accordingly. It took a publication like The Clinical Management of Nicotine Dependence (1991) to serve as the legal substrate to the litany of lawsuits that followed.<br/>Similarly, limiting NNN (N-nitrosonornicotine) in smokeless tobacco products is highly likely to further increase the incidence of nicotine dependence and cancer, while rallying the sales of light smokeless tobacco, thereby making smokeless tobacco product manufactures an even greater fortune. <br/>It is just a matter of time before some addiction or healthy lifestyle guru publishes a comprehensive textbook on the clinical management of smokeless tobacco products (or the equivalent), and the smokeless tobacco product companies will not have the very deep pockets and the compellingly vast international following that helped tobacco companies survive and prosper. <br/>The FDA might consider scrapping this NNN Docket to sculpt a newer one to include but not be limited to: 1) warning labels on all smokeless tobacco products; 2) new quit smokeless tobacco public service announcements and ads, channeled into the already existing quit smoking infrastructure; 3) mandatory health insurance, life insurance, Social Security, and disability urine NNN screens, with corresponding premium hikes or benefit depletions based on positive NNN results; 4) 30% food stamp (SNAP) allocations toward fresh fruit and 30% toward fresh vegetables to help prevent cancer born of systemic oxidative stress caused by NNN; and 5) suggestions to smokeless tobacco product manufacturers that they tool up for an alternative product production, such as beginning to annex themselves with pharmaceutical companies to help develop new inhaler delivery systems for certain established pharmaceutical products.<br/>The money state and federal governments might lose from taxes of smokeless tobacco products and industries may be gained from pertinently stepping up insurance premiums, stepping down benefits, shortening hospital and long-term care stays, and prolonging productivity and spending.<br/>This Docket should be scrapped in its entirety and resubmitted in a form that benefits all sides of the trade.<br/>If you require additional information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me by email.<br/>Respectfully submitted,<br/><br/>James A. Cocores, M.D.<br/><br/>Editor, The Clinical Management of Nicotine Dependence, Springer International<br/>",

    "text": "As an employee in the indoor tanning industry, I strongly oppose the FDAs proposal to ban tanning by minors and to require customers to sign a risk acknowledgement<br/> form every six months. Our customers enjoy tanning for a variety of reasons, and for the reasons outlined below, no further government regulation is needed.<br/> <br/>First, the decision of whether a minor should tan, be that outdoors in the sun or indoors at a tanning salon (that enforces limited tan times and other<br/> safety precautions), is best left to parents, not the federal government. Most states already require parental consent for minors to tan indoors, ensuring the parent has input and approval.<br/> <br/>In addition, we have many teenage clients who are referred to indoor tanning by their doctor or dermatologist to treat skin conditions. Why should these clients be<br/> required to obtain these services at a dermatology office which is much more expensive than at an indoor tanning salon? <br/><br/> <br/>If minors are prohibited from using indoor tanning salons, they will instead use sunbeds at home, in an unregulated and unsupervised environment, and likely tan more<br/> aggressively outdoors. These alternatives would lead to an increase in sunburn and injury, compared to tanning at our salons which enforce tan time limits and other safety precautions.<br/><br/> <br/>Next, requiring adults to sign a risk acknowledgement certification every six months in order to use a sunbed is absurd. Our customers<br/> are already required to acknowledge risk before their first session; requiring this to be done every six months would be an administrative nightmare and tremendous burden to our salon employees, without serving any valid public purpose. There is no other product<br/> or service in the country, including the purchase of alcohol, tobacco and red meat, that requires consumers to sign such a form. It would be unfair to require such a form in our business and not for the hundreds of products and services which present many<br/> more dangers than UV exposure.<br/> <br/>For all of these reasons, I am strongly opposed to these proposed additional regulations.<br/><br/>",

Oversight and regulation are needed to some extent to curb improper use. However, widespread and overly strict rules lead to animals that are not treated with necessary medications for fear of breaking rules. Veterinarians are trained to diagnose illness AND prescribe appropriate therapy. Producers and veterinarians feel as if their hands are tied when an appropriate medication could be used responsibly but is considered illegal because of labeling. Both veterinarians and producers are trained to observe appropriate withdrawal times and have the resources to find answers even if it is not stated on the label. We eat too! Our own families are consumers so we would not put them or our livelihood at risk knowingly using medications inappropriately. <br/><br/>There are programs like BQA and PQA that have improved animal welfare and producer knowledge. We do care about our animals. I encourage you to visit http://www.iabeef.org/on-the-farm/meet-a-cattle-farmer<br/><br/>Duration of therapy decisions should also be made by trained veterinarians familiar with the animals, caretakers, housing and end product being produced.

    "text": "These new technologies allow animal breeders the opportunities to repair harmful genetic disease causing mutations by restoring animals to their wild type genetic sequences.<br/><br/>These new regulations put significant barriers in the way of those efforts, the fundamental perspective of the animal itself as a &quot;new animal drug&quot; in those cases doesn&#39;t match the legal definition of a &quot;new animal drug&quot;. I&#39;m also very wary of the implications of classifying any genome as a drug.<br/><br/>FD&amp;C 201(v)<br/><br/>(v) The term &quot;new animal drug&quot; means any drug intended for use for animals other than man, including any drug intended for use in animal feed but not including such animal feed,<br/>(1) the composition of which is such that such drug is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof; except that such a drug not so recognized shall not be deemed to be a &quot;new animal drug&quot; if at any time prior to June 25, 1938, it was subject to the Food and Drug Act of June 30, 1906, as amended, and if at such time its labeling contained the same representations concerning the conditions of its use; or<br/>(2) the composition of which is such that such drug, as a result of investigations to determine its safety and effectiveness for use under such conditions, has become so recognized but which has not, otherwise than in such investigations, been used to a material extent or for a material time under such conditions.<br/>Provided that any drug intended for minor use or use in a minor species that is not the subject of a final regulation published by the Secretary through notice and comment rulemaking finding that the criteria of paragraphs (1) and (2) have not been met (or that the exception to the criterion in paragraph (1) has been met) is a new animal drug.<br/><br/>Section (1) states that drugs which are &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot; are not &quot;new animal drugs&quot;. Clearly wildtype genes are generally recognized as safe and have been used to material extent and for material time regardless of the origins of the sequence. There is no fundamental difference between identical genetic sequences produced by evolution, selective breeding, random mutagenesis, or modern molecular technologies, therefore no fundamental difference in their risk profiles. <br/><br/>If the FDA is regulating in a risk-based, scientific manner then clearly regulating based on the method used to produce a sequence isn&#39;t the correct approach. Why would causing a genetic disease by radiation induced mutagenisis be assumed safe but reversing a disease causing mutation via modern molecular technologies be assumed unsafe? This revision is clearly not based on mitigating risks to people, animals or the environment. <br/><br/>Beyond that this approach creates the possibility for situations that can&#39;t be clearly regulated. For example, if a breeder repaired a genetic disease and restored an animal to it&#39;s natural genetic sequence that animal and it&#39;s offspring would be considered a drug. If the durg/animal were then bred to an animal of wild type with an identical gene sequence in the affected area, would the pups be legally drugs or not? The identical nature of the gene sequences of both parents makes it impossible to tell if they inherited it from the drug/parent or the non-drug parent.<br/><br/>if a genome edit is made using CRISPR, say a nucleotide is added then it&#39;s removed from the next generation by natural mutation or random mutagenisis is the regulated article gone and that second generation is not a drug?<br/><br/>If a genome edit is made to a male mammal on the Y chromosome will his daughters be drugs since they couldn&#39;t have inherited the change?<br/><br/>In the event of a deletion what exactly is the article, the missing nucleotides?<br/><br/>I have two general suggestions for different approaches that avoid some of these issues. <br/><br/>1. Regulate based on the risk not the breeding method, there is no scientific reason to bias regulations against modern breeding techniques in favor of older less exact methods. <br/><br/>2. If you must bias regulations against advance breeding methods make an exception for &quot;restorative edits&quot; or &quot;genomic repair&quot; where no novel sequences are introduced into a given species. Those genomic alterations that only transpose wild type sequences between animals within a single species. Since nothing novel is created other than gene flow within a species, it&#39;s risk profile is indistinguishable from selective breeding, so reasonably the genomes of those animals should have the same legal status. Considering there is an existing exemption for random mutagenisis despite its risks, this shouldn&#39;t be an issue, and it will allow breeders the freedom to use advanced techniques to repair the thousands of genetic diseases that have accumulated in our domestic animals because of the limits of selective breeding.",

The outpatient non-diagnostic services immediately preceding the day prior to the admission must be added to the inpatient claim for non-subsection (d) hospitals.  If the non-diagnostic services do not relate to the inpatient stay, the hospital must attest that they are unrelated to the admission.  CMS is to provide further guidance to hospitals on the attestation process.  This policy change is effective for services provided on or after 6/25/2010.<br/><br/>We appreciate the opportunity to continue to unbundle services, but believe that some of the proposed controls are not necessary.  <br/><br/>1)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Per the FY 2011 IPPS final rule:  &ldquo;An outpatient service is related to the admission if it is clinically associated with the reason for a patient&rsquo;s inpatient admission&rdquo;.  It would be helpful if CMS clearly defined &ldquo;clinically associated&rdquo; outpatient non-diagnostic services to avoid further confusion in the hospital community regarding unrelated outpatient non-diagnostic services.  Also, we believe that any lack of clearly defined clinically associated services could cause confusion and more complications under post-review audits.   <br/>2)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We strongly disagree with CMS&rsquo; proposal to implement an attestation process.  Hospitals are currently required to bundle related services and we don&rsquo;t believe that an attestation would provide additional value to the process.  It would require additional administrative effort by hospital staff that doesn&rsquo;t seem necessary as claims are required to be filed correctly under the law.  If an attestation is required, the attestation process should be easy to follow and clearly defined:  a) what is required in the medical record documentation to substantiate the service is unrelated; b) the format of the attestation; c) who must sign the attestation; and d) who is ultimately responsible for the attestation.  <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment and CMS&rsquo; consideration of our comments on the 3-day payment window interim final rule.  If you have any questions please contact Teri Hills at (480) 301-4885 or me at (507) 284-4627.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Ronald Grousky<br/>Director, Medicare Strategy Unit",

Most states already require parental consent for minors to tan indoors, ensuring the parent has input and approval.<br/> <br/>In addition, we have many teenage clients who are referred to indoor tanning by their doctor or dermatologist to treat skin conditions.

Commercial aviation is a very uncomfortable, crowded experience today, and would be made immeasurably worse if passengers are stuck next to people shouting into their cell phones (shouting because the ambient noise level of the plane makes it difficult for them to be heard clearly). If a passenger has an urgent need to communicate while in the air, texting is certainly a reasonable alternative that will not disturb any fellow passengers.",

On January 23, 2017, APHIS withdrew the 2017 HPA final rule from publication without undertaking notice and comment procedures, in accordance with a memorandum that was issued by the Executive Office of the President on January 20, 2017.  However, following a lawsuit, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found this withdrawal to be deficient.  The District Court has indicated that one way to remedy this deficiency is to undertake notice and comment procedures on the proposed withdrawal.  APHIS is therefore proposing to withdraw the 2017 HPA final rule, and take public comment on this matter.  Comments on the withdrawal are due no later than August 21, 2023."

As it is, airplanes are more crowded in the past decade, with less space in one&#39;s seat than before. Frustration levels run high when the person ahead of you leans his/her seat back, leaving you with less space, and the person next to you uses your arm rest or intrudes on your space. Add to that several or more people chatting loudly on their phones with disregard to everyone around them, and you have the perfect storm of terrible conditions.

One is the equivalent to the US No Discharge Zone. In all cases, the ships had been retrofitted with small sewage holding tanks with very little trouble. Certainly vessels in Puget Sound, with the five-year implementation schedule, can easily comply with the requirements of a no discharge zone. Although there are objections from some small commercial vessels, they have small crews that produce small volumes of sewage. With the high number of pumpout stations, including one being prepared at the Port of Seattle&#39;s Pier 69 in Elliot Bay, a small commercial vessel should have no problem retrofitting its toilets with small holding tanks. Other large vessels should also have little problem adapting to these regulations. <br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this preliminary affirmative determination.

These same storm sewers also carry the untreated waste pets - pets that outnumber boaters significantly. <br/><br/>Even the treated sewage being discharged by municipalities deserves more attention. The Seattle Time reported on 2/23/2016 that Puget Sound fish were found with detectable levels of prescription drugs not removed by water treatment standards. http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/drugs-flooding-into-puget-sound-and-its-salmon/ Why isn&#39;t this a priority?<br/><br/>This petition is a mis-direction of efforts to help water quality. <br/><br/>Meredith Daniels, Gig Harbor, WA",

    "text": "To tackle the contributing insult that comes from boats discharging into the vital waters of Puget Sound, please approve the Puget Sound No Discharge Zone, a designated area where the discharge of sewage (black water/toilet waste) from boats, whether treated or not, is prohibited.<br/><br/>If a no-discharge zone is established, no boat, whether a freighter, a cruise ship or a sailboat will be allowed to discharge waste anywhere within the designated zone. The zone basically extends from the Canadian border, through the San Juan Islands to the southern reaches of Puget Sound.<br/><br/>Sewage from boats affects our lakes, bays and beaches. That sewage includes bacteria, viruses and pathogens, and emerging chemicals of concern that can close shellfish beds and make humans sick.<br/><br/>We are collectively working hard to recover shellfish beds and keep our beaches clean for swimming and recreation, which is why a no-discharge zone is a priority of the Puget Sound Partnership Action Plan. Surprisingly, our Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) region is the only region in the country where these types of zones have not yet been established.<br/><br/>There are 90 no-discharge zones in 26 states. And not one in our precious waters that we&#39;ve spent so much effort and money to protect.<br/><br/>In Puget Sound, we have more than the required amount of pump-out capacity for recreational and commercial vessels with both pump-out stations on docks, mobile pump-out boats and trucks.<br/><br/>As to the onboard sewage-treatment systems on most boats  they do not adequately protect water quality and public health.<br/><br/>The social, cultural and economic value of the shellfish harvest in Puget Sound  whether it&#39;s tribal, recreational or commercial  is enormous. And it is a deep part of our heritage.<br/><br/>The shellfish industry has an annual value of $184 million. And while tourism and recreation also play a central role in our local economies, they all require the same essential ingredient: clean water. While pollution makes its way into the Sound in various ways, a no-discharge zone will help solve a discrete part of this complex equation.<br/><br/>As we think about protection in a world where the population is growing but the geography isn&#39;t, we might ask, is the system too big to fail? We must begin to tackle the multiple insults to this stunningly beautiful chemical and biological system.<br/><br/>The Salish Sea is part of the economic engine of the state, the source of communal pride, our shared vernacular and a spiritual, hallowed ground.<br/><br/>Let&#39;s think ahead. Let&#39;s stop dumping. We can do this. It is 2016. It&#39;s time to designate a no-discharge zone to protect our sensitive resources in Puget Sound.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve copied most of this message from an op-ed. I agree with its contents. <br/><br/>",

    "text": "It seems to me that the overfishing by commercial seiner&#39;s and longliner&#39;s who turn around and export the Pacific Bluefin to Japan in order to maximize profits are doing a lot more damage to the species than a few recreational fisherman who have had their limits reduced to 2 fish. The opportunity to target these fish does not even come along with any regularity. In my 45 years of fishing I have caught less than 30 pacific bluefin. Not even a 1 fish per year average. This is not a sportfishing problem but rather a greedy commercial enterprise issue. Limit the take of the seiner&#39;s and longliner&#39;s as you have the recreational fisherman and the species will recover. ",

    "text": "I have been fishing off the coast of San Diego for over 40 years and have owned my own off shore boat since 2004. I believe my fishing skills are okay. Only the past 2 years has there have been a rare number of Bluefin Tuna in our local waters.  Although I specifically targeted them this year I was one of numerous private boaters that did not even get a strike although dozens if not hundreds of 80 plus pound Bluefin Tuna were crashing all around my boat.  They were close enough I probably could have touched them. Although I spent hundreds of dollars on fuel and bait I was skunked The three separate times I went out. It was not for lack of effort. I have talked to several fisherman who had the same luck. Like myself many others tried their luck a few times and gave up due to the Bluefins finicky bite. <br/><br/>In reading the fishing reports, seeing only a rare few fishermen landing a Bluefin Tuna is a more accurate view on the subject. When a commercial charter boat goes out with a 23 passenger load and only a hand full of fisherman hook and land a Bluefin tuna how can that compare to large seiners and long line commercial fishing that are raping the ocean.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, I have been fishing on my own boat for 12 years and have caught less than 6 Bluefin Tuna over that time period.  This is a more common story than your study reflects.<br/><br/>Private fisherman are not the problem.",

The result of this ESA listing is important to me.<br/><br/>While the population of Pacific bluefin tuna has, in recent decades, declined to historic levels, the species is not in danger of extinction. The United States Government, NOAA, and the international organizations responsible for management of this pelagic species, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), took action several years ago to reduce fishing pressure and conserve stocks. The most recent scientific data demonstrates that these international conservation efforts to improve Pacific bluefin tuna stocks have been successful in stabilizing the global population and stocks have already begun the rebuilding process.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments.",

    "text": "I oppose the destruction of bats and their habitat by gas and oil companies, as is being considered by the Service. I oppose the development of a proposal for an &quot;Incidental Take Permit&quot; and advocate that an Environmental Impact Statement provide comprehensive analysis of alternative actions that will not allow the taking of bats. <br/><br/>Chesapeake, MarkWest, Williams, Anthero Resources, Ascent Resources, Southwestern, EQT, EnLink Midstream, MPLX, Marathon Petroleum, and Rice Energy are companies that routinely infringe on these species through gas and oil exploration and development activities. The continuation of their projects will result in continuing harm due to the unavoidable impacts entailed in this development, despite the promise of a Habitat Conservation Plan to be developed through the upcoming EIS process. This is especially true considering the cumulative impact of allowing this destruction over a 50 year period.<br/><br/>The Scope for the EIS must examine the impacts that accompany oil and gas development including water withdrawal and depletion, toxic waste generation and disposal, land changes that result in habitat loss and fragmentation, water contamination and air pollution, and the emission of greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change. These are known to affect the roosting and foraging ecology of bats, particularly during critical life periods (e.g., hibernation, migration, and reproduction) (Hein, C. D. 2012).  Bats are known to have low reproductive rates and respond slowly to rapid population declines (Barclay and Harder 2005).The devastation of White-nose Syndrome has resulted in a stunning decline of nearly 98% of hibernating bat populations in Pennsylvania (Turner et al. 2011). This disease and the effects of other human activities that degrade and destroy suitable habitat and resources are compounding challenges that bats must already withstand (Kunz and Parsons 2009). Bats are struggling to survive here; these takings could be the final blow for some species.<br/><br/>Bats are critical to our economy and ecology. For instance, worldwide, bats function as pollinators, seed dispersers, and biological controls for nocturnal insects (Kunz and Parsons 2009) (Jones et al. 2009). In Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, most species consume large quantities of night-flying insects, many of which are agricultural and forest pests. (Hein, C. D. 2012). Their loss will be our loss.<br/><br/>I oppose the consideration and proposal of an Incidental Take Permit for bats and oppose the consideration of the reduction of the protections now in place for bats in these locations for any period of time.  All five of these bat species are in need of more effective protections in the face of the multiple challenges they already must contend with so they may continue to be a critically beneficial part of the regional ecosystem.",
